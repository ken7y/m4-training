Because now there are thousands of people who have a higher purchasing power.

It will also be taxed which means more money for government assistance programs and infrastructure, and all the other bullshit government spends on.

{"text": "Retards, As you are moving from RH to various others brokers, you will have to read these rules otherwise you will fuck your account and you won't be able to trade for a year. By Default your broker will create'S a cash account for you VS RH had by default a margin Account. If you have a margin account then please ignore and \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 If you have a cash account you can request for Margin account if you have $$ if not request might be denied. Examples : As the term implies, a cash account requires that you pay for all purchases in full by the settlement date. For example, if you bought 1,000 shares of ABC stock on Monday for $10,000, you would need to have $10,000 in cash available in your account to pay for the trade on settlement date. According to industry standards, most securities have a settlement date that occurs on trade date plus 2 business days (T+2). That means that if you buy a stock on a Monday, settlement date would be Wednesday. If you plan to trade strictly on a cash basis, there are 3 types of potential violations you should aim to avoid: good faith violations, freeriding, and cash liquidations. ## Good faith violation What is it? A good faith violation occurs when you buy a security and sell it before paying for the initial purchase in full with settled funds. Only cash or the sales proceeds of fully paid for securities qualify as \"settled funds.\" Liquidating a position before it was ever paid for with settled funds is considered a \"good faith violation\" because no good faith effort was made to deposit additional cash into the account prior to settlement date. The following examples illustrate how 2 hypothetical traders (Marty and Trudy) might incur good faith violations: Good faith violation example, Marty: Cash available to trade = $0.00 On Monday morning, Marty sells XYZ stock and nets $10,000 in cash account proceeds On Monday afternoon, he buys ABC stock for $10,000 If Marty sells ABC stock prior to Wednesday (the settlement date of the XYZ sale), the transaction would be deemed a good faith violation because ABC stock was sold before the account had sufficient funds to fully pay for the purchase. Good faith violation example, Trudy: Cash available to trade = $10,000, all of which is settled On Monday morning, Trudy buys $10,000 of XYZ stock On Monday mid-day, she sells XYZ stock for $10,500 At this point, Trudy has not incurred a good faith violation because she had sufficient settled funds to pay for the purchase of XYZ stock at the time of the purchase. However: Near market close on Monday, Trudy buys $10,500 of ABC stock On Tuesday afternoon, she sells ABC stock and incurs a good faith violation This trade is a violation because Trudy sold ABC before Monday's sale of XYZ stock settled and those proceeds became available to pay for the purchase of ABC stock Consequences: If you incur 3 good faith violations in a 12-month period in a cash account, your brokerage firm will restrict your account. This means you will only be able to buy securities if you have sufficient settled cash in the account prior to placing a trade. This restriction will be effective for 90 calendar days. ## Freeriding violation What is it? While the term \"freeriding\" may sound like a pleasant experience, it's anything but. A freeriding violation occurs when you buy securities and then pay for that purchase by using the proceeds from a sale of the same securities. This practice violates Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board concerning broker-dealer credit to customers. The following examples illustrate how 2 hypothetical traders (Marty and Trudy) might incur freeriding violations. Freeriding example, Marty: Marty has $0 cash available to trade On Monday morning, Marty buys $10,000 of ABC stock No payment is received from Marty by Wednesday's settlement date On Thursday, Marty sells ABC stock for $10,500 to cover the cost of his purchase A freeriding violation occurs because Marty did not pay for the stock in full prior to selling it. Freeriding example, Trudy: Trudy has $5,000 cash available to trade On Monday morning, she buys $10,000 of ABC stock with the intention of sending a $5,000 payment before Wednesday through an electronic funds transfer On Tuesday, ABC stock rises dramatically in value due to rumors of a takeover Later in the day on Tuesday, Trudy sells ABC stock for $15,000 and decides it is no longer necessary to send the $5,000 payment A freeriding violation has occurs because the $10,000 purchase of ABC stock was paid for, in part, with proceeds from the sale of ABC stock. Consequences: If you incur 1 freeriding violation in a 12-month period in a cash account, your brokerage firm will restrict your account. This means you will only be able to buy securities if you have sufficient settled cash in the account prior to placing a trade. This restriction will be effective for 90 calendar days. As these examples illustrate, it's easy to encounter problems if you are an active trader and don't fully understand cash account trading rules. It is important to maintain sufficient settled funds to pay for purchases in full by settlement date to help you avoid cash account restrictions. ## Cash liquidation violation What is it? A cash liquidation violation occurs when you buy securities and cover the cost of that purchase by selling other fully paid securities after the purchase date. This is considered a violation because brokerage industry rules require you to have sufficient settled cash in your account to cover purchases on settlement date. The following example illustrates how Marty, a hypothetical trader, might incur a cash liquidation violation: Cash liquidation violation example, Marty: Cash available to trade = $0.00 On Monday, Marty buys $10,000 of ABC stock On Tuesday, he sells $12,500 of XYZ stock to raise cash to pay for the ABC trade that will settle on Wednesday A cash liquidation violation will occur. Why? Because when the ABC purchase settles on Wednesday, Marty's cash account will not have sufficient settled cash to pay for the purchase because the sale of the XYZ stock will not settle until Thursday. Consequences: If you incur 3 cash liquidation violations in a 12-month period in a cash account, your brokerage firm will restrict your account. This means you will only be able to buy securities if you have sufficient settled cash in the account prior to placing a trade. This restriction will be effective for 90 calendar days. \u200b Source : Fidelity [", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-01-30 08:01:03", "id": "l85krp"}

{"text": "Source: Gerald Klein - Forty year career in finance and executive management beginning on Coopers & Lybrand audit staff (CPA) culminating with twenty-six years as CEO of publicly-held companies. Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail. The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain. When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well. Typical tactics include the following: Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down. The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit. By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of \"strategic fails-to-deliver\" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will \"mask\" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news. Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other \"success\" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification. Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud. Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called \"crashing\" the stock and a successful \"crash\" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash \"stick\" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following: Media Assault - The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media. The shorts have \"friendly\" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the \"friendly\" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed. One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This \"mistake\" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation \"Due to a mathematical error\" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price. Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function: >When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game. This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube. Analyst Reports - Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned \"friendly\" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation. Planting moles in target companies - The shorts plant \"moles\" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media. Frivolous SEC investigations - The shorts \"leak\" tips to the SEC about \"corporate malfeasance\" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed \"confidential inquiry\" is leaked to the short media. The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community. Class Action lawsuits - Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors. Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. - If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product. Pulling margin from long customers - The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover.

The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for ( This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics. How Pervasive Is This? At any given point in time more than 100 emerging companies are under attack as described above. This is not to be confused with the day-to-day shorting that occurs in virtually every stock, which is purportedly about thirty percent of the daily volume. The success rate for short attacks is over ninety percent-a success being defined as putting the company into bankruptcy or driving the stock price to pennies. It is estimated that 1000 small companies have been put out of business by the shorts. Admittedly, not every small company deserves to succeed, but they do deserve a level playing field. The secrecy that surrounds the shorts, the prime brokers, the DTC and the regulatory agencies makes it impossible to accurately estimate how much money has been stolen from the investing public by these predators, but the total is measured in billions of dollars. The problem is also international in scope. To learn more go to [", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-01-29 02:48:38", "id": "l71yxn"}

{"text": "I'm an actual Wall Street type. Mine is a common NYC story. I went to Yale and Stanford, coming from working class roots out of nowhere. I didn't have a plan for after college, so I did NYC banking work like everyone similar at the time (it was a few years before everyone decided they should go to DotCom companies). The \"I don't have a plan\" on campus interview train of my day usually led to \"easy\" money doing bank work in Manhattan. I'm older than nearly everyone on this sub. I did the 100 hour weeks (before blackberrys and iphones existed en masse, so you had to actually sit at your fucking desk all night). I made some money, but not master of the universe money. Enough to be comfortable, even in NYC (it was cheaper in the 90s). You could have seen me at Anna's in the Financial District in the late 90s. It's a Dos Toros now. I stuck with it. Went to grad school and back. I moved uptown and into private equity buyout work, at a well known shop in midtown. You could have found me in the 2000s with one of those (in retrospect) stupid looking Hermes \"H\" belts we all had those days (tie to match). By this time I'd lost my drinking pretense. I'd get drunk at a hole called Jimmy's corner. Just tried to get through the day. Hated every minute of it. But I was decent at the jobs and got many promotions. I got carry on the right deal, and I moved out of PE the second I got paid. I'm in a completely second career now by choice, and I have never looked back. I left a lot on the table, but I fucking hated working those deals. Soul crushing. Buy a company, fire people, take some liberties with accounting and make short term decisions that will bite company in ass 10 years down the road, sell company in 5 years. Rinse repeat. I've seen a lot of shit. I've been with our advisors at Lazard trying to bullshit our way through 12 week cashflow statement to save a shitty company and get a rescue package at 2am. I've been in a Wachtell conference room at 3am hammering final points to sign before an 830am pre-market takeover announcement. I nearly tripped over the Blackstone 3 story sky lobby stairs at one point. I went to closing dinners at every place that was cool 20 years ago but are probably sad or closed now (BTW: you kids should lobby to bring back closing dinners; they went away in 07 but are fucking awesome). I'd put my bona fides up against anyone (almost anyone?) here. \u200b Most importantly, I've seen a lot of shifty, disingenuous bullshit. But major brokerages closing trading today was probably the worst thing I ever saw. It's a terrible investment and I'm going to lose money, but I threw some $$$ down to protest.

No shit. It's obviously not going to happen, but in theory it could. If literally every single person held, the hedge funds' prime lenders would have to liquidate everything and pay us whatever ransom we want. FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO WEAR HELMETS IN THEIR CARS: The point is that we are in control, NOT that you're going to make $100,000 per share. EDIT 2: Holy shit it's worse than I thought. If you can't afford GME, respect. Buy some AMC and fuck the suits that way--but for the people who can afford to choose, GME IS THE ONLY ONE WITH A SHORT INTEREST WAY ABOVE 100%. I like AMC, BB, and NOK, too, but I really don't think you guys understand the GME situation. We caught the bastards who have been fucking us our whole lives with their pants down. They have shorted more shares than exist. We own the shares. BUT THIS IS ONLY TRUE OF GME.

{"text": "Tl;dr. Nasdaq exchange is threatening to engage with FINRA and the SEC if they \u201csee a significant rise in the chatter on social media channels\u201d. Which is maybe the most arbitrary guideline ever. I SUGGEST A FULL TRADING HOURS POST BLACKOUT TOMORROW (Except for mods if necessary) OR MAYBE BETTER AN AUTO-DELETION OF ANY POSTS MENTIONING THE NAME GAMESTOP OR TICKER GME. And during this time, we all need to know only one thing, which is to BUY GME, and don\u2019t worry about the establishment playing dirty. We are only playing their own game while they try every dirty trick. As long as we keep our diamond hands, none of these scare tactics can or will work. I\u2019m a SPACs guy. I\u2019ve been sitting on the sidelines for this because honestly at first I couldn\u2019t care less. WSB isn\u2019t my thing. Then I started reading the news. The hate. The vitriol. Targeted at who?! Not the guys who shorted 140% of a stock\u2019s float?? But at retail?? Seriously? Every news station I see, every YouTube video from the TV is in protection of the establishment, Melvin, and Wall Street. Then I started reading the stories from the small guys. YouTube comments. The Reddit posts. Families devastated in 2008. Surviving off beans and rice and out of work. And the hedge funds? They were bailed off and eventually made off with their billions. These same folks are ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HISTORY THIS TIME. And these folks know what it\u2019s like to be hurt. AKA they have COMPASSION. The number of posts I\u2019ve seen sharing their newfound wealth with someone who needs it \u2026 Unfathomable for what I originally had thought of wsb. It\u2019s something Wall Street will never understand. Not a penny of profit goes to charity. Not a penny of profit goes to helping others. AND NOW THIS?! NOBODY is on our side except our own damn selves. The brokerages are on the other side. TD Ameritrade restricted GME trading. So called 'Robinhood' sent out a notice that no more options positions may be opened for GME this week. The exchange itself is on the other side! The Nasdaq CEO is suggesting a trading halt to allow big investors to \u2018recalibrate their positions\u2019 and that they will engage FINRA and the SEC if \u2018we see a significant rise in social media chatter\u201d. [ Who was there for us when we got screwed over? Nobody. \u201cThese small and unsophisticated investors are probably going to get hurt by this.\u201d WTF?!? We\u2019ve redistributed billions of wealth away from the ultra-rich, and you\u2019re worried about us getting hurt? This reads like a feudal lord trying to protect his serfs from the \u201cdangers of freedom\u201d.** Piss off. Now that we\u2019ve established that these people are pieces of shit enriching only themselves. First things first. # Fundamentals. This company is still (even at $350!) only trading at a multiple of 3.7x 2020 revenue. Stocks like Blink Charging are literally trading at 1000x 2020 revenue. Why the hell are they complaining about fundamentals now? Chewy is trading at 25x 2020 revenue. If Ryan Cohen can turn GameStop around into an e-commerce business with even a quarter of the success as Chewy - this stock literally DESERVES to be valued at $1000. That puts it at 10x LTM revenue. Putting aside balance sheet fundamentals\u2026 GME will reach $1000 and that is a conservative estimate. With a short ratio of 6 (days to cover), and pure anger at the establishment raging around the entire US - scratch that, THE WORLD, this PT will be reached with ease. # LASTLY. The light at the end of the tunnel. Everyone from the SEC to CNBC to the Nasdaq CEO to the brokerages are fuming at us and they are ready to pull out any damn trick in the book to make this end. Here is the lowdown on what to do next and why none of their threats matters. \u200b 1. Moves? Buy buy buy buy buy. If you cannot buy options, buy shares. If you can\u2019t buy options or shares, use an alternate broker. If you don\u2019t have one, file a formal complaint against your broker. [ The SEC may not do anything about it, but having a formal complaint open strengthens the case for the future of civil action. 2. SEC: The time has inevitably come that the SEC is actively snooping around here. Looking for signs of collusion. Some have said that we need to consider getting a megaphone, an official Twitter account to represent us. But to be honest, that actually seems like the last thing we want. The decentralization of this sub is its power. What is the SEC going to do? Arrest all of us? Track us all down? There is little they can realistically do. Worrying about the SEC directly should not be a priority (unless the investigation is being perpetuated by someone powerful, like the NASDAQ exchange itself is attempting to do). 3. News media? There is just so much misinformation misrepresenting this sub\u2019s position along with CNBC absolutely denigrating us and putting out misleading news reports. \u201cEpic Bubble is Building. Its Less Frothy in China\u201d \u201cYou Will Lose Your Money Very Quickly\u201d \u201cGameStop analyst calls it a pyramid scheme\u201d These are literal article titles from CNBC trying to lure us away. All I can do is facepalm at these moron\u2019s hypocrisy. We literally just like the stock. Thank god for guys like Chamath. He is only guy on the other side I heard speak up for us today. There is only one thing we can do here. Never forget. One day it will bite them for being on the wrong side of history. 4. Exchanges threats to halt the market? They can do whatever tf they want. A halt won\u2019t magically bring the price back down. 5. And the juicy part. Nasdaq exchange threatening to engage with FINRA and the SEC? I think we need a full trading hours GME ticker ban. Or a blackout for all posts, period. The only thing we have to remember is that WE LIKE THE STOCK. And Diamond Hands. I will be selling off some of my SPACs and placing a market order for GME at open. It\u2019s go time. I will not sell until the shorts have been squoze.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-01-28 18:38:37", "id": "l6rxrh"}

{"text": "A lot of us have sick people we want to take care of. The rocket we've ridden for the last few days had helped some us us take care of those we love. But it seems like the rocket has run out of fuel. So I have found another opportunity that could change lives forever. Some of you may already know about it but regardless I'm going to talk about it because I truly believe in it. It's called Crispr. It's a genetic editing technology with massive potential. Imagine all the hereditary diseases and health issues that may exist in your family. Alzheimer's, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart failure, all manner of cancers of syndromes. Crispr has the capability to remove those things from your children and the children that follow at the genetic level. Crispr scientists received a Nobel Prize earlier this year for their work. About 4 months ago, they treated a few individuals suffering from sickle cell disease. Those people now live virtually symptom free. Every time Crispr Therapeutics(CRSP) puts out a press release, it's good news, and this pumps up their stock price dramatically. They peaked somewhere around the $210 per share mark a few weeks ago and have corrected down to $170 per share in the last 2 days. The crazy part is that this is a publicly traded company that has no products on the market. They're operating at a loss, similarly to the way Tesla and Amazon were in recent years. The moment those two companys posted any profits, their share price flew through the roof to the moon. I dont see why Crispr Therapeutics(CRSP) would be any different. I would paste links to news articles, press releases, and research data, but there is so much out there about that I don't feel the need to. See for yourselves. Look at the data, look at the charts and make the choice for yourself. The potential for this investment is sky high. It's an investment for you as individuals, and it's an investment in the future of medicine.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-01-29 02:58:58", "id": "l729qh"}

They are a company with a market cap of $26.2 billion. That is nothing for a company their size. \u200b Or, look at JPMorgan. They have a market cap of $392 billion.

How much money are people losing right now because of this, and how much are the hedges saving right now? I'm here to say that it's time we all stop using RH. It's garbage. I have been using Ameritrade for a while as well, and it is an excellent alternative. Some transactions have $0 fees, and the most I've paid on a trade is $6 at this point. Well worth the price to not have to deal with RH fuckery like this ever again. Super easy to set up an account and you can transfer funds and start trading right away. Their app is cool too. Consider this or another platform. Even saw you can buy stock on Cashapp now. RH has fucked us after making bank off all of our transactions. It's time for them to face a reckoning. They aren't the only game in town and it seems like they need to be reminded of that. I'm buying in on Ameritrade and then closing my RH positions when profitable and closing my account.

{"text": "There is a prevailing mis-understanding among people fresh to the market that you can buy and sell as much as you want at the \"market price.\" This is false. You are buying and selling from real people or algorithms that believe they can scalp your order. The idealized scenario is that GME rallies, Melvin covers, and everyone at reddit gets out at the top. This represents a misunderstanding of market mechanics. Melvin will cover before we truly know it, and the crash will happen as quick as the rally. So with recent events, you must ask yourself: # Who is Your Counterparty? Nothing is a sure bet. How confident are you that your counterparty is who you think it is? Thousands of redditors & new traders beyond have been buying stocks fully confident that Melvin Capital hasn't exited their trade. This is also supported by some analysis provided by two different firms, although their estimates differ some amount. Confounded in this is the interpretation of the data: Does this include market makers and dealers that are short stock but covered with calls or options deltas? Is their information fully accurate in an event the likes of which has never happened? It's tough to know for sure. # Know Everyone's Hand Your guess on how much they've covered and when they covered has a massive effect on how you perceive the value of this trade. Buying if you think Melvin has $10b notional to cover is a much better bet than if they only have $2b to cover. You also have to consider how much notional the rest of the market has bought in anticipation of a squeeze. The difference between the two represents your effective edge. Remember, we don't actually know Melvin's current position. We don't know what's going on behind closed doors. We only know the hand they're showing us via media. Has their clearing firm taken over? Has a much bigger collection of firms absorbed the position? Have they been buying since Monday? Have they covered and have new funds entered the space at a much better level? You are fighting Goliath at a poker table in the city of Gath. The pot is worth $25 billion dollars. Ken Griffin has never lost. Melvin's prime brokers Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche are not used to losing (well, Deutsche is). They will do whatever it takes to take the pot from you and leave you holding the bag. They will not blink twice because there is a lot of fucking money on the line. # Know What Can Go Wrong Nobody could have guessed everything that happened this week. Prepare yourself for the unexpected. Your brokerage will undoubtedly close out your position at the worst possible time. The stock could be halted for days. You could be assigned on ITM options. Your stock could get delisted. Your stock may get diluted. # Only Spend What You're Willing to Lose This one is self explanatory. Your investment could go to zero. Even if you think you make money on every trade, if your bet size is 100%, the long term value of your portfolio is zero. # Don't Take Out Loans on Emotional Capital If you are new, you really don't know the gut-wrenching, stomach-turning feeling of seeing the possibility of your net liquidity hitting zero or negative. It fucking sucks. You just know the highs. You're buying along the speculative frenzy and frantic rallies, wrapped in anti-billionaire & pro-underdog themes. It may even feel good to think that a guy who cut his teeth at a firm notorious for an insider trading scandal is getting his comeuppance. We love the feeling. If you are fully invested financially & emotionally, you are completely overleveraged and will pay the price. Make feeling good your goal, and set limits that you can stomach. There are several feel-good stories of people making life-changing money to pay off their student loans or their family members' surgeries. Please think twice about this, and only spend what you can afford to lose. If placing a bet makes the difference between your pet living or dying, you may have a gambling problem. These were success stories because they got in at a much better level and could have had a much sadder ending. Secondly, don't take it personal. There are people on the other side of your trades, your brokerage support line, the subreddit, the media. They are all playing their own hand to the best of their knowledge. It's easy to blame a broker, yell at their support desk, hate-tweet at a company, or even rage-text that guy you know who develops APIs at ETrade. A lot of people across the industry are rooting for you. Fuck, even Ted Cruz and AOC are rooting for you, because this transcends politics. If you're mad at Melvin Capital or Ken Griffin or the guys who crashed the economy in 2008, keep it that way. They will try and misdirect your anger in every single direction: brokerages, the media, and reddit. If your enemies are a few guys at the top holding a $25b short position and moving levers, keep it that way. Thirdly, if you don't want to be a human being for the sake of the person on the other side, be a human being for your wallet's sake.

I\u2019m in the U.K. and tried to buy on, trading 212, Revolut, Hargreaves Lansdown and eToro, none of them would allow me to buy. This was clearly arranged, how can we be expected to believe that they all just decided to do it at the same time independently. (Revolut have since allowed me to buy, but only after the price had gone rapidly down) And the fact this wasn\u2019t just in the U.K. and the platforms I was trying to use, the fact that buys were blocked across the globe shows me that it was a concerted effort to drive the price down; clearly it was decided that if no-one can buy then the market will just build up sell orders. It\u2019s changing the rules whilst the game is in play and so totally ridiculous to claim that it was a risk we should have been aware of when buying. If it\u2019s a risk we\u2019re supposed to be aware of then how can anyone have faith in that system. The scary part about this is it was not done in secret, nor has any real noteworthy attempt to hide what\u2019s been done taken place. It\u2019s out in the open, as if they don\u2019t care that we all know they have done this. I think that\u2019s almost the worst part about it all.

I don\u2019t have any faith that they will face any real repercussions from their actions. So I feel it is up to the people in the markets to act so they feel the repercussions. Certainly buying shares like GME where possible now could help in the short term. Decentralised exchanges might be a good way to go in the longer term. I have no doubt many might disagree but the weird internet coins or the blocks and chains foundations could help in some way pull control out of their hands and back into the masses.

Official definition: Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. * A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze. Dumbed down version: \\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. \\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions?

In light of the extraordinary market conditions this week, we temporarily limited buying for certain securities this morning. Starting tomorrow, we plan to allow limited buys of these securities. We\u2019ll continue to monitor the situation and may make adjustments as needed. This was a temporary decision made to best continue serving you, and was not an easy one to make. We know it\u2019s led to frustration and confusion, and wanted to provide some clarity. As a brokerage firm, we have many financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits. Some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment. These requirements exist to protect investors and the markets and we take our responsibilities to comply with them seriously, including through the measures we have taken today. To be clear, this decision was not made on the direction of any market maker we route to or other market participants. The past year in particular has shown us that the financial markets are for everyone\u2014not just institutional investors and hedge funds. We\u2019ve seen a new generation enter the market, and they\u2019re sparking conversations about what it means to be an investor. We stand in support of you, our customers. Democratizing finance for all means giving more people access, not less. We\u2019ll keep monitoring market conditions and will update this Help Center article with the latest changes.

{"text": "If I, a clinical psychologist, were a hedge fund manager or consultant and the expiration date of my shorts was this Friday, I would create the illusion of a squeeze before the actual squeeze occurred. First, I would get on WSB boards and understand the narrative for low, medium, and high range squeeze values. But more importantly, I would look to see where the greatest agreement is found among the WSB members. Based on my own perusing, I would see a low value of $420.69, medium value of $1,000, and high value of over $2,000. Because retail investors are destroying my financials because I am so deep into this scheme, the $420.69 value is the target for my last ditch effort. Hedge fund managers know this could get even more out of their control. I would then save all of my tactics for one last ditch effort, including collaboration with other hedge funds, for the high 300\u2019s or very low 400\u2019s. Remember I want you, as a retail investor, to think the squeeze is happening and that you need to sell quickly. When the stock hits $400 and there is a sharp decrease between 50 and 100% most people will sell, thinking they just witnessed the squeeze, in turn saving the hedge funds billions of dollars had the stock price rose to $1000, or more. The squeeze, however, may come on Friday when their shorts expire. Hedge funds take many different variables into consideration when making bets on the stock market. What their fancy algorithms and statistical software packages can\u2019t predict is how individuals will behave in an unprecedented time, especially when those individuals are able to easily communicate with each other. Retail investors have the upper hand. TLDR: Hedge funds may continue to manipulate the price through various short selling tactics, leaning on each other to slow the hemorrhage of cash they are experiencing. Time is on the side of shareholders, not the hedge funds. TLDR because TLDR was too long: \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 IMPORTANT: This is not financial advice.

{"text": "I know this is long and none of you can read, but bear with me. As most of you know, stocks can only go down to zero. So the profit for shorts is limited down to zero, and the loss for longs is limited to zero. When stocks go up, the profit for longs is limitless and the loss for shorts is also limitless, theoretically of course. So imagine being short, stuck in a massively losing position where if you push the price down, zero is the best payoff. Ironically this was the bet Melvin made before he got steamrolled by the internet. But what about if you could go long? The sky is the limit and could theoretically cover more of your losses than trying to go back to zero. $GME closed at $193 today, so if they're still in the hole, all they can try is pushing it to zero and dig the hole deeper which seems like a dumb plan. So this is what I think they're going to do. Yesterday, the CEO of the Nasdaq suggested a halt to trading to let institutions \"recalibrate\" their positions: >Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman suggested Wednesday that her exchange could halt trading activity for stocks, in the event they were targeted by internet users, to enable the exchange to investigate possible manipulation and allow investors to \u201crecalibrate.\u201d > What if a halt wasn't possible, but they needed a way to kill the momentum of retail buyers and allow $GME to fall? The best solution would be to cut off retail from purchasing/bidding up the price. That's all you need to do. Only let them sell or hold, which would contribute no pricing pressure at all or only downward pressure. This would allow hedge funds price control over $GME so they could move it lower with ladder attacks without having to worry about or battle with retail pushing against them. If anything retail would panic and sell. And thus today we saw a massive attack which brought $GME down over $350. 2.Some short covering has obviously taken place. Some Korean firm I think sold a few million shares they were long. It's a small dent but not enough to fix the problem. And the short volume is up markedly, while the short interest is still over 50 million shares. I've seen higher SI figures and I don't know how Ortex computes this, whether it includes naked shorts or not. But here's the updated graph: So you can see they've covered some bets, probably the biggest losers shorting from like $30 or something. But they seem to have reloaded, as others here and on twitter have reported. The short volume is up massively and days to cover is at its lower point ever. I've read that shorts have to return 30 million shares tomorrow. I have no idea if this is true, but if it is, it means the game is coming to an end and they need to close their position by buying which they will have to do eventually. So the final step after pushing $GME into the dirt and doing some short covering, is to setup positions to go long. $GME hit a low of $112 today. The best way for shorts out is to go long and to do so through derivatives, specifically cheap calls. As most of you know, the further out of the money a call is, the cheaper it is. Now I don't know what the $570 strike expiring tomorrow was trading at when $GME hit $112 (I just wish I had bought some). But it's currently less than $1k and was much cheaper earlier. And more importantly, over 12,000 of these were bought TODAY. Normally I'd attribute these 0DTE cheap moonshots to the retar, erm, traders here. But considering most of you can't buy right now, and that Robinhood has never allowed 0DTE options purchases, I have to think this was institutional buying: Some people have mentioned holding through the weekend as calls would expire ITM. Wouldn't they want to avoid that by getting the squeeze done and over with so they expire OTM? Just a thought. If I'm right, and the shorts have loaded up on 0DTE moonshot calls and are ready to stop playing games and exit, they will let this thing finally fly now that they can make a ton of money on the upside through calls. The ride up will be swift and so will the ride back down. The best way for them to play this is to position themselves with calls at the bottom (today), then start the unloading of their short positions through buying and let it ride as high as they can to cover however deep they are. And once that ends, they will cash in the calls, which will cause MMs to sell off their delta-hedged shares behind those calls, shorts will stop buying any more shares, and probably short the price back down because they're greedy fucks. All of this would send the price plummeting right after a top. Fortunately we have circuit breakers now which I don't think existed back when VW went to the moon. Look at a chart of the VW Squeeze: See how the stock fell beforehand...probably to let shorts reposition themselves for the inevitable. Is that happening today? Maybe. The point is it's very violent up and then back down. The squeeze on VW all happened in one day, perhaps over hours or less. So you have to be ready. How high does it go? I would expect anything above $500 is risky (but I dream of $1k+ like the rest of you). Whether they load up on $50 calls or $500 calls both will go up along with the price. You never know where the top is so have a game plan. The top is wherever they need it to be to get right with God (the banks backing them). So be ready and realistic. If you can't watch charts, set a sell limit (I know, I know). But please don't diamond hands major profits to nothing by going through a squeeze and not selling because you're also a greedy fuck. I've been a member of this autistic playground long enough to watch diamond hands go to zero, repeatedly. I nearly went extinct as a gay bear myself for diamond-handing puts into the summer after the market crashed in March. Positions and disclosures: 19 Feb 21 $400 Call x 2 19 Feb 21 $150 Call x 3 20 shares (lol) -$100k or +$250k, we'll see what happens. This is not financial advice and I'm no insider, just a retar...trader like the rest of you. Do not risk what you cannot afford to lose. Good luck. Hope to see you all on the moon, because after all the shit they've pulled with $GME, you deserve it. Edit: I never said don't hold past $500. I think that could be the floor for when this kicks off. But I have no idea when it ends. I'm not trying to scare you to sell. I just don't want anyone here to baghold. It's always brutal to see and this is easily the biggest play WSB has rallied around.

{"text": "WTF is SGMO? Like Crispr, but better. SGMO uses ZFNs (zinc-finger nucleases) which are much more efficient, site specific (less off-target effects), and even able to edit mitochondria. And they are miles ahead clinically. For a more detailed explanation, feel free to read the first two DD I posted. First one was when SGMO stock price was under $10: \\-SGMO DD- Crispr Patents, Valuation, and ARKG. There was some initial data pointing to superiority of CRSP in this indication (transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia) but what most analysts failed to realize or under-emphasized was that CRSP achieved a better result via a highly toxic conditioning regimen. So toxic in fact, one of the two patients they treated went septic (an infection in the blood). ^(Without getting into it too much, this is ex-viv0 editing where cells are edited outside the body and re-infused with the genetic abnormality fixed, so it\u2019s very similar to chemo before an autologous (you use your own cells) ^(bone marrow transplant.)) 1.

Looks like he\u2019s leaving in February but his stock options are good through May 27th but merger, buyout, new partnership\u2026who knows? But any CFO not looking to get FO wouldn\u2019t dip on some incoming tendies across dose cohorts. ^(For you stonk apes, Phase 1 and 2 are \u201cdose finding\u201d studies where the first concern is safety, and Phase 3 is focused on efficacy. Factor levels appear to wane over time, but in hemophilia the difference between severe and normal lifestyle can hinge on a marginal amount of clotting factor produced. So although I wouldn\u2019t use the word cure outright, excluding re-dosing tech coming down the pipeline this is a functional cure for X years in a patient population that not only experiences life threatening frank bleeds, but other debilitating symptoms secondary to small bleeds and clots (arthralgias, limited quality of life), and ultra-high cost factor infusions (>100,000k per year) for some.) And as far as safety/efficacy is concerned, SGMO had one bleed 52 weeks out and Biomarin (BMRN) had so many bleeds and low/unresponsive factor levels and intra-patient variability that the FDA requested a more data when they tried to file for accelerated review and got rejected. And in case you don\u2019t believe BMRN think's you're stupid and is doing everything they can to try and get their inferior product to market before SGMO, check out this graph of factor levels where coloration does not correspond to zero on the y-axis to make its data look better. So although it can be tricky to trade, there\u2019s a metric shit ton of stuff not priced in. And if you want to see real stock price manipulation in action, check out the share price on the following dates that correspond to the article pic: \u200b 12/7-12/10: Best-in-class hemophilia A results for SB-525 reported 12/7, premarket and SGMO opens $9.93 and closes at a loss for $9.05. Positive beta thalassemia results reported 12/9, premarket. Notice the run up doesn\u2019t happen until 12/10, A FULL 3 DAYS AFTER INITIAL HEME A TRIAL NEWS. Sounds like enough time to cover. Stock immediately pulls back after run-up 12/10. 12/18-12/23: stock runs from low of $13.50 to high of $18.24 on announcement of Pfizer taking over heme A trial in phase 3 following stellar Phase 1/2 results. Notice the run up starts 12/18, 5 DAYS BEFORE NEWS RELEASE ON 12/23. For record I posted my first DD on Sunday Dec 20th, with shares at $14.36 from the previous Friday, in full fucking disbelief that share price hadn\u2019t gone up from Heme A results and Pfizer takeover of the trial. Next few days it rocketed to $18.64 before the shorts decided it was time to tap it down again. Since then, red days on low volume. Just taaaaaaap it down, shorts. Give it a little tappy. Tap tap taparoo. YOLO Screenshot attached, and that's one of 3 accounts (need to roll out those May calls). SGMO is still the majority of my tradeable retirement.

{"text": "Hey Brad, First a bit about me, I'm young and have been trading successfully with my own money for the last 2.5 years and am now retired. Thanks Elon. With that out of the way, the beautiful thing about this movement is it's not a movement with any one representative point of view. It's more of a public gathering where if one person has an idea and it's well thought through, it gets upvoted and awarded. It's truly democratic and decentralized. The GME phenomenon started exactly this way, when a few people including Michael Burry (Big Short fame) noticed that it was trading ridiculously below book value. Others on here took notice and believe it or not, did thorough due diligence (I encourage you to use the \"DD filter\" and see some of this, it's pretty incredible work) with financials laid out and then wrote posts about it. When Chewy founder Ryan Cohen took on a large position and became another activist investor with a grand new vision, more people on here noticed and saw not only and undervalued asset but one with actual explosive growth potential given the gaming sector growth. Then people here took notice of the fact that 148% of the float was sold short (still a bit hazy on how this is legal) and did what Wall St. and the mainstream media didn't do, they looked and saw the audacity and greed of a few funds who thought they could never lose, were completely over leveraged and then acted on this public info and posted about it. More people here noticed and more people acted. This is done everyday by hedge funds behind closed doors. The only thing we did differently is we did it out in the open and without inside information. With that said, I have to respectfully decline to go on the air and be a representative of over 2.8 million members of Wallstreetbets, which by design, is not a coordinated movement and should not have a representative. I sincerely believe this and am not trying to be a hero or \"anti-establishment.\" I really appreciate you reaching out and I want you to feel free to use any of this for your segment but please make sure to stress that this is just the view of 1 out of 2.8 million people and not necessarily the views of the subreddit. I really think Fox Business has a once in a lifetime opportunity to cover the shift of market power from private to public and to differentiate itself from the hacks at CNBC.

There is not a single news article about Citadel, Melvin, Point72, D1 or Maplelane (the dementor hedge funds) with regards to what happened today. DON'T LET THEM GET AWAY WITH THIS. Brokers who removed 'buy stonks' will get sued into oblivion and everyone will focus on them while the dementor hedge funds will get away with absolutely zero repercussion as always. You need to go back to first principles, where all of this started in the first place: the dementors have shorted more than the total available shares issued by $GME and way, way more than the float. It is also very likely that they strong-armed the brokers today and triggered the short ladder. Conjecture All roads lead back to Citadel. There needs to be a class action lawsuit against Citadel (It would be of no surprise if the class action lawsuit against RH is bankrolled by Citadel as a deflection) Here are just a few things to connect the dots: Citadel accounts for 41% of all retail trading daily volume and 32% of all options volume flow to Citadel]( Citadel, LLC is the parent company of Melvin Capital only provided $750M on top of the $2B from Citadel ( ( Yes, the very same ( ( TL;DR: Not all roads lead to Rome.

{"text": "My mind is confused about one topic and I think most of the people here are aswell. -Now lets think about how heavily shorted GME was before the things that happened last week. 1) We know GME was shorted like 140% (when it was 10-20$) 2) Right now some say that the percentage of the shorts increased or decreased and we don\u2019t seem to have any legit data about this. 3) Lots of people say that the shorts have covered their original shorts which were around 5 to 10 dollars and instead have their shorts based on 300 to 400 dollars. So my question is about the third argument. How can so many people be sure that shorts that were originally underwater were covered? It makes no sense as the HFs who owned these shorts had to buy most of stocks to cover and that alone would have caused the short squeeze to go astronomical. But that didn\u2019t happen instead it went up just a bit. My guess and it is just a thought and not a financial advice. Why wouldn\u2019t most of HFs be still under water? I think right now what is going on is the HFs are trying to gobble up some stocks from a price point that is as low as possible to cover their original shorts so they dont lose that much money. I just like the stock and I want you smooth-brains to help me to find an answer about this.

{"text": "Since my last comments got buried, I figured I\u2019d do my autists who haven\u2019t gone full qanon a favor and paint you the bigger picture of how this shit will go down. It\u2019s long so strap in kiddos. The squeeze is over. It\u2019s happened. It happened on Wednesday into Thursday when it hit the intraday high of 483. This squeeze was when we fucked over Melvin to the tune of 50% of their portfolio who were shorting at a fucking ridiculous $3 entry. We did it. We won. Now where you retards went wrong is you failed to realize that there was a whole new flood of shorts at $400. This is why short interest (more on short interest later) stayed at roughly 60m shares short which is where you get your divine 110% short number. This is when all hell broke loose and wall st. did their usual fuck the retails and the poors tactic, and guess what. It worked. It went from intraday highs of $483 down into the 200s for a lot of Thursday and Friday. THIS IS WHEN THEY COVERED. Let\u2019s get one thing straight. Wsb\u2019s greatest advantage AND weakness is diamond handing. You either hold to become DFV or you hold to become the guy who lost 500k on luckin coffee. HFs don\u2019t give a shit about diamond handing. They drool over .001% alpha on volume trading so no fucking shit they\u2019re going to cover from 400 to 200. So now the short interest sits at roughly 50%, but probably closer to 30% when you take into account various hedges. It means these new shorts fucked you all to the tune of over 6b when they covered. Daily interest rates are a fucking joke when they\u2019ve made their profits already. The remaining shares short are their yolos. Now here\u2019s where you retards really fucked up. You keep expecting the same short squeeze potential when we first squoze. That pressure was legitimate as Melvin was sitting on shorts initiated at $3. Every move upwards fucked them hard. Anyone who\u2019s held ITM options knows the joy of high delta. But you retards don\u2019t realize that these new shorts are initiated at $400. HOW THE FUCK IS RETAIL GOING TO PUSH THIS TO 400 WITHOUT A SQUEEZE? The only reason it got there was the squeeze from the $3 short. Diamond handing at these levels does fucking zero. You fucks need to purchase at 400 - then push beyond that to 500-600 to put any sort of pressure on these new shorts. Diamond handing does literally NOTHING because they\u2019re under no pressure besides laughable interest rates. In a way, it\u2019s actually beautiful. You\u2019re all holding OTM options with a delta of .005 with zero catalysts and zero hope for a squeeze. It\u2019s wsb at its finest. At this point, aside from the automated ladder attacks, you\u2019re all just bidding against each other and there\u2019s not enough momentum to turn the tide. One last time for you dense motherfuckers out there - diamond handing does not pressure these new shorts. You need to buy to $350+ and then buy again at those levels. Buying dips does jack shit. Now, a quick primer on short interest. The only reliable info on short interest is the SEC report that comes out every 15 days. There are a stupid number of outlets reporting 15 day old (all melvin) figures. Which brings us to the slimy fucks at S3. Yes they have citron-like marketing, but it\u2019s the only publicly available model for short interest. They showed that during wed/thurs, short interest was still at 110%. The problem was that you yards thought it was Melvin instead of the new shorts. They then updated again to show that short interest was now down to 50% levels or 30% if you take into the hedges I mentioned earlier. You can reeeeee all you want, and accuse them of being shills, but just take a look at this price action. Is it possible they\u2019re lying out of their teeth? Sure. But It\u2019s pretty fucking clear what is taking place so just fucking Occam\u2019s razor it you tards. You\u2019re all bagholding for \u201cideals\u201d and \u201cjustice\u201d. If you all want to sacrifice your money to these vampire fucks out of your unwavering sense of virtue, be my guest. Just post some loss porn for the rest of us.

{"text": "Posting from work on behalf of 12 of us here who all want to get in on the action from India. We are complete idiots wrt to this and do not know how to proceed. I'm also unsure what the best brokerage (app) is to proceed with, I know RH doesn't let non-americans sign up. I read somewhere about another Asian who funded his capital.com account and lost everything because he was actually trading umm.. CFDs and didn't change the.. leverage settings or something. If this is the case indeed then aren't these brokerages actually making money hand over fist due noobs wanting to get in the GME frenzy? I feel if there was proper guidance on how international noobs can get started and setup their apps or whatever to hold long then WSB can actually have more people backing them. I for one will make a wiki-style post if I figure how its done. My main questions are 1. What brokerages are good for Non-Americans? 2. Should we go with CFDs or Options? 3. Can a non-American actually legally even own a stock of an American company listed on NYSE? 4. Is there a basic guidance on account setup so as to not let brokerages dupe us into losing our money? I'm sorry if asking all this is against the rules, I've searched all morning on reddit and YouTube but I found nothing that clearly explains. Any help will be much appreciated.

{"text": "TLDR: BBY Rocket Ship Emoji, Calls (2/19, 2/26, 3/19 115-120cs or a strike near their all time high of 123) and Shares This is so similar to the other BB ticker DDs I did that most of it going to sound familiar. If you already bought BBY on accident this thinking it was BB or BBBY and need some reassurance, you're in the right place. First, going over my retarded investing tenets to make sure my dumb plays align with it: Overall: Everyone and their mom buys electronics at Best Buy. This has accelerated to extremes over the last quarter, positioning BBY for a huge earnings blowout on 2/25. It is a direct beneficiary of stimulus checks, and was upgraded by Bank of America with a 132, YES ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO, price target just two days ago. BBY is 10$ under it's all time high and starting to moon. Check the chart, retard. Upside: BBY has cash on hand, $5.1B to be exact (which doubled since COVID began, from $2.2B to $5.1B. See? What did I say?) They grew online sales by 174%, AND store sales by 23%. They're being forcefully pivoted online, which is exactly what they NEEDED to do, so even if their leadership was dumb COVID has helped them. Additionally, every boomer is heading to Best Buy to set up their WFH setups with a blank check from their jobs that they can expense. They surprised with an EPS of $2.04 last quarter vs $1.70 expected. Margins are only getting better as they can reduce benefits, track every minute of an employee's logged in time, and shut down stores / fire people without any public backlash due to COVID. Remember how we all jacked off about GME console sales? BBY is BIGGER and sells more. Basically guaranteed revenue bump from this quarter that wasn't there last year, which will impress wall street because they're retarded like us and like when numbers go up. The website has crashed over and over due to video game demand. That sounds bad, but it's like with PTON being unable to fulfill orders... so many people want it that they're crashing the site. They're still below their ATH of 123 from just 2 months ago and they've only been performing the same or better since then. Most importantly in my mind, they are still undervalued because they didn't provide good guidance last quarter. Last quarter they beat every metric but the stock dropped from ATH of 123 to ~113 because they said Q4 sales likely wouldn't be as high due to their high Q3. Well guess what, the market is already pricing in a slow Q4 for every business. There's uncertainty in this stock because of that, yet think of it: how could they have messed up extra console sales and stree-free closure of unprofitable stores? I mean, they could, which I'll go over below. Downsides: Usually my largest gripe is with the people. In this case, CEO Corie Barry is a traditional \"okay\" CEO with a few scandals under her. If she were a really skilled CEO, Best Buy could've been one of the best internet retailers ALREADY. But I'm still going with BBY since COVID is basically forcing them online faster than she would've pushed them. So let's recap so far: An actual profitable business and growing online presence, with all the benfits of having cash on hand. Uncertain guidance leading to wall street hesitance Tailwinds (gov and economic) pushing them to greater profitability (not even including new console season). I love this play and it's one of my sleepers. People should realize BBY is similar to GME, TGT, WMT, etc and will outperform it's \"brick and mortar\" expectations online. Easy win play: Just buy shares if you're scared Autistic play: BBY 2/19, 3/19 $115-120c or near their ATHs.

{"text": "Hello! I would like to take a moment to say thank you to all the new information, sources and insight given by everyone here. Secondly I\u2019m new to active trading and stocks other than dropping money in and never looking into it. I\u2019m new to WSB, Reddit (I just looked at Jeep stuff before WSB) and I actually got into really applying my money into stocks for long term investments in 2018. October 2019 I decided to make allotments to have reoccurring investments. So much to speak that I\u2019ve built a \u201cportfolio\u201d and was up and down day after day. Never paid attention. In December 2020 is when the idea of \u201cmy money make money for me\u201d came to me and I tried. Few weeks later this GME thing hit and I made some very \u201cemotional calls\u201d mixed with FOMO. With those calls came MANY lessons. Some takeaways to all my fellow new investors that I\u2019ve learned and I hope people can learn from my mistakes without going through: A.) Never invest/gamble/stock play with what you cannot afford to lose. This goes without saying. B.) A loss is only a loss if you look at it in such a manner. Where you have a loss there\u2019s a learning lesson and as boomer as it sounds with knowledge comes power; the power to take past mistakes and fool proof your future plans. C.) The stock market is a vicious and volatile area and money can be made as fast as lost. It IS possible to recover, learn how, do your DD. C1.) The stock market is not for everyone. Short term investments with high hopes of a fast bucks can become a long term ordeal that you may or may not be ready to handle. D.) Prepare for the worst, hope for the best. These are just some key points I\u2019ve jotted down on my notes to myself and as I said, If even one young investor can pick something from this and benefit from my mistake then it\u2019s worth it.

{"text": "Cannabis 2021 and Merger Arbitrage ($APHA and $TLRY Merger Arb)[ So if you've been seeing the headlines of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer addressing marijuana, you're probably considering getting some exposure to the marijuana industry. Not a bad idea. I think it is a great opportunity, and it's where most of my investments will be in 2021. But let me tell you about an interesting opportunity within the cannabis sector. $APHA (Aphria) and $TLRY (Tilray) are set to merge by end of April or May, and together will form the largest cannabis company in the world. $APHA is purchasing $TLRY, but the new company will move forward under the $TLRY ticker. So what does this mean? Well, currently, the price of $APHA is $16.75 and the price of $TLRY is $25.75. The exchange rate for the merger of $APHA to $TLRY is .83. For every 1 banana from $APHA, you get .83 $TLRY bananas. Lets say I buy 1 share of $APHA today at $16.75 and the merger is tomorrow. My 1 share of $APHA will convert into .83 shares of $TLRY. At $TLRY current price of $25.75, your .83 of a share is now worth $21.37. Remember, you only paid $16.75, and now it is worth $21.37 just based on the details of the merger alone. This also works with options, which makes me rock hard. Your contract of 100 shares at a certain SP, will represent 83 shares instead after the merger but keep the strike price. You can literally buy deep ITM call options at a steep discount. A $25 $APHA call is OTM, but ITM for $TLRY. However, just so you're aware, in this case your max delta of your option is 83 instead of 1.0. meaning instead of getting a $100 to $1 move, you will get $83 to $1 move. I know what you're thinking. \"Well that's why it's discounted dumbass.\" And you'd be wrong. Let's take a look at a couple call options and their prices.. APHA calls only go up to $25 right now, even 2 years out. So I'll be using $25sp $TLRY $25c Jan 2023. That option is $1,218 to purchase, or $12.18/share. $APHA 25c Jan 2023. That option is $610 to purchase or $6.10/share. You're losing 17% in share control of your option, but buying at a 50% discount. Anyway, not financial advice. Just babbling. Could all be made up while I wait for my crayons to heat up. Plus prices can change, but beyond your average red day there's no reason to expect a hard nose dive from either company at the moment, and instead looks like it should be a good year for cannabis overall. Maybe the best year ever, especially as an American, but we will have to wait and see. $APHA $TLRY \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf31\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf31\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf31\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf31\ud83d\ude80", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-02-04 12:15:31", "id": "lc4y7q"}

Even though their call position on SPY is still larger than their put position, they increased their hedge by 12000% (basically nonexistent to very tangible) while their call position only increased a comparatively modest 52% The Bill and Melinda Fund has retreated a bit from the market, they withdrew a sizable portion of their positions and only bought one stock, schrodinger Inc.

Why can't people accept the simple fact that a 5,000+ percent increase in a borderline worthless stock IS LITERALLY MILES BEYOND THE MOON? A lot of people got in at $300 so maybe they didn't get to experience the take off from Earth, but you need to realize how cheap the stock was just weeks ago. I saw some people say that the stock could go up to $5,000 which is literally impossible. How can anybody even think that a subreddit can drive a company up from $1 billion to $500 billion? That would make it a top 10-15 company in the world... a company with a dying future. That is not even remotely possible. The reality is that most of the big boys will always be selling the stock at the top while you all hold the line. You all work together to drive the stock price up, but also ignore the fact that if it takes all of you to drive the stock up to $400, it's going to crash once everyone decides to cash out and MANY of you will be left without your retirement funds. In order for the stock to even go from $350 to 400, people have to keep buying at those high prices. But if even 10% of you start selling off, all of those people who bought in late will get fucked. You guys cannot all profit no matter how hard you work together. Please do some real due diligence and understand what you are investing in for the future, and ALWAYS have an exit strategy.

{"text": "Okay fellow retards, i am either going full retard or full Michael Burry right now. While my girlfriend was out with her boyfriend and i was playing with my Lego, i figured out what is going on, i am gonna make it very simple, because my brain does not allow me to make complex thoughts, so here goes. First, we know that Melvin cuckital and other Hedge bros shorted heavily GME, the SI was 200069% and the strike should be fairly low, which leads to a short squeeze, now at this point the losses they were looking at was at the Billions or more ( that's a lot of money, in case you dont understand). A lot of apes here think that they are trying to floor the stock so they can cover their asses and not pay out, but here is the catch, THEY DON'T. If HFs have so much power to destroy a stock while the price and volume is so fucking high combined with the fact that they can do this while the world is looking at them, then they would be Gazillionaires by now. If a HFs can create so much swing in a stock like GME, then what prohibits them from doing so in a smaller stock with much lower volume and make a shit ton of money all the time, the SEC ??? Fucking lmao if you thought that My point here is, that we are overestimating their powers and i am going to explain why. We got the news that shorts covered their positions, which everyone thought was BS, but i believe they actually did, and here is how. We know that Melvin got around 50 Bn capital a few days ago, so how did they persuade investors to give them money??? Did they tell them they will try to manipulate the stock and bet that people will sell off, do you think rich people heard that and said \"Oh yeah, great idea, lets bet 50bn that retarded apes will panic and sell off\", fuck no, they proposed a real plan, that would not bet on us doing sane things and i am gonna tell you their plan and why it makes sense. They know that GME is a ticking bomb, they know that people want GME to MOON, so they hedged their bets by manipulating the stock to drop at 80-90, possibly lower and buy a fuck ton of calls to hedge their retarded bet. They feed the MSM with BS, manipulate the market, so the price drops, then they buy a fuck ton of calls/shares so they will limit their losses or even make more money. S3 partners, media, RH have started acting like our friends now, isnt this a bit suspicious??? It is, because they now want the stock to fucking rocket, so their friends can get their money back. So what happened is, Melvin got money to buy calls, fed media BS to drop the price and buy calls at good prices, now the media,S3 and RH are with us, the stock will rocket and they will hedge their bets and cover their asses, it all makes sense. Edit: I am kinda retarded and dont know how to use symbols so more people can understand, sorry Edit 2: I am not a financial advisor, i dont know how the market works, this is not any kind of advice.

Now that WALL STREET was able to play dirty and take the fuel out of GME, I NO LONGER believe GME will reach those prices anymore. NOW the share price will behave like any other normal stock. As GME offers new services and a new business model, then the share price will rise proportionally to the value the company offers.

{"text": "Too Long Can't Read: HOLD GME!!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf19 First, I'm not an advisor or some quant with some bullshit MBA from a Top Tier school trying to scare anybody. With everybody dropping RH like my ex-wife dropping me for Chad, I wanted to read on the process during the transfer of these accounts. I noticed a post where Fidelity was up 700% in transfer requests this weekend. I would assume the same for other non BROKErages. I have Fidelity and I use ToS for charting, but I read up on the process for transfer from RH. First you have to pay $75 bucks to get transferred from RH. That's a crock of shit but I guess its still \"free\" trading. Secondly, RH will sell your fractional shares prior to transfer through ACATS (This is the system for \"transferring\" shares from one brokerage to another). This will take place prior to T+2 which is the SEC standard. Now when your transfer is taking place you do not have access to trading your stonks at all. Time to bring back the old PornHub.. Thirdly, all your limit orders have been canceled during this process. This means that if GME tanks (HOLD you dumbfuck) you will be out of it and just screaming at the screen seeing dildos (green or red) while your wife is boned by her bf. Lastly, the process fully takes 10-14 days to \"settle\". You get credit for the stonks at T+2 but there could be restrictions on trading depending on the brokerage. Fidelity does not have this issue... But broneilbro...what does this mean for GME? Well, kid... 1. RH will clump all the fractional shares from the transferees together and dump them at market per RH > \"If you have any fractional shares during a full account transfer, they will be sold, and the resulting funds will be transferred to the other brokerage as cash during a residual sweep.\" These will be gobbled up by hopefully the GMEGang but it will supply shares to the market. Depending on how many full shares this could minimal if assuming a .99 fractional share x RH transferees... 2. The GME shares that are transffered will effectively be \"off the table\" during the ACAT process which will lead to a massive \"group\" HOLD for T+2 days depending on when RH autists transferred out. This should cause a drop in volume since GME retards won't be able to trade but will help out as the shorts cannot buy these shares as they are out of play. 3. The process for getting margin approval and options access could take a few days due to the volume of transferees. This will show up as a general \"pause\" within GME as traders are waiting for account access. This could be good or bad depending on the view. 4. This mass transfer out of RH will be a blessing to them as they will not have to deal with the GME liquidity funding mechanisms. Just my thoughts on everybody fleeing RH...there will be a slight pause but that will give people a chance to poke around the platforms and get used to it prior to going all in on GME...

So they attack us. You come on to WSB to see that other people are holding still. You check to see if DFV and Mark Cuban are still telling us to hold. We need to show them our numbers. Yeah, anyone can read the number of current members of WSB and if you sort by \u201cNew\u201d you can see the stream of loss porn for those who are \u270b\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a When we see a stream of people holding, it\u2019s comforting. Let\u2019s back that with data. We need a count of the number of shares that we collectively hold. If Melvin is trying to get our shares, we need to know how many we\u2019re holding. A poll or census needs to be distributed in order to take a count of what we\u2019re working with. This works for a couple of reasons: we know what strength there is in our numbers and the public will see who we are as a group. I saw someone mention that if we all had 3 shares each, there would (at the time) be 21 million shares distributed among us. I hold 20 shares. DFV is still holding 50,500 as of his update earlier today. Do we have 10 million or do we have 60 million? Let\u2019s find out. Vote this up so people can see this and we can have a discussion on the validity of this idea. Maybe people already have and I haven\u2019t seen it. I deeply hate the fucking financial system. I see it destroying the world. GameStop was a dream for my childhood. It\u2019s honestly one of the only parts of my childhood I care to still hold onto. I love this stock and I hate the system that crushes individuals and families alike. I hate being a slave. TLDR: Let\u2019s take a poll to figure out how many stocks we hold as a group.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-02-04 14:31:13", "id": "lc7j99"}

{"text": "Listen up fellow autists, I've been talking with your wife's boyfriends and there is a large play going on behind the scenes with companies like $MA. I know reading and comprehension is a challenge on this sub but I believe in you. TLDR at the bottom for the true apes among us. What the f is $MA doing talking with CleanSpark- a <1billion market cap, relatively small company? A company that is by all intents and purposes in the energy sector. CleanSpark Inc focuses on solving modern energy challenges. They focus on software solutions that provide energy modeling, energy market communications, and energy management solutions. Okay, and what does that have to do with XBT or $MA? They own ATL Data Centers, which mines, encrypts, and enables the use of the XBT and other currencies alike. This is HUGE for $MA as just last week they announced a plan to incorporate 'other currencies' into the companies current global business model. The company\u2019s XBT mining segment brought in 32% of total revenue last year and is growing RAPIDLY. This XBT segment ALONE brought in 115-150million last year versus the 30 million expected because of the new processing capacity they have for mining -modern problems require modern solutions. CleanSpark reported an extremely strong and unexpected quarter. With quarterly revenue of 2.26 million, an increase of 130% from .98 million for the prior year.** This is not a pump and dump. This is not a game to be played. Fellow autists, we are on the cusp of an XBT revolution. CleanSpark has earning reports coming up on 2/23. You will see a jump. You will diamond hand it and you will thank me later. TLDR: CleanSpark (find the ticker yourself) is a hidden stock that has already posted a 130%+ gain from last year from their efforts to be at the forefront of XBT in a global economy ANS they are working with $MA to incorporate XBT, which would make $MA the WORLDS FIRST global financial service business to incorporate XBT into their business plan. \u200b The time is among us.

We\u2019ve not only changed the game for the little guys but we\u2019ve improved the lives of many individuals, including myself. I invested in GME when it was $9 because you batshit crazy motherfuckers told me to do so back late last year. So I took all my PLTR gains and dropped it in GME stock and diamond handed this bitch. Needless to say, it\u2019s the best decision I ever made. I made more money than I ever thought I could make. It still doesn\u2019t feel real knowing that when GME goes to $10,000 a share, I will have an 8 figure net worth.

WE ARE THE ONES PROTECTING THE COMMON WORKER, AND WE ARE COMING FOR THE BIG DOGS. So to get to the point, I\u2019m a medical student in my last year of medical school going into cardiothoracic surgery. At my institution, we have one of the most world renowned pediatric cardiac surgeons in the world, and he just so happens to be one of my mentors. This past week I spoke to him about my willingness to give back to the world, and I gave him one of my ideas. I asked him if he would do pro-bono work on his end, on a couple of patients in need of heart surgery from around the world, if I would cover the hospital costs and the transportation of the children and their families, along with their housing and post-operative care. He instantly agreed (he is a good man). He advised me on how to go about doing all the administrative approvals and work. I did not want to write this until I got the OK from the institution, however, as of today I got the call for the green light. The projected costs I have to cover allow me to only be able to cover the costs of 2 of the surgeries, but at least it\u2019s something. This week I will start reaching out to organizations to find two kids that the surgeon and I feel are in most dire need of heart surgery. When we find the candidates I will upload their stories and will keep all of you updated. You guys have truly moved me, and I would never have been able to do this without you guys.

{"text": "Alright- I posted a position in Trivago on Friday and I wanted to follow up with a list of reasons why I think Trivago could be a great play for 2021. For those that know about Trivago, it essentially serves as a price comparison tool for multiple travel sites and it allows you to book hotels. This is a recovery play that may or may not pan out, I believe that the floor for Trivago is probably around 2.00 right now so you may see those prices should this fail to pan out. Also, Expedia is a large owner in Trivago and Trivago is a European based company. Trivago is a cost per click business that essentially puts multiple pricing on the same site and lets the customer compare. With Leisure travel picking back up and companies desperate for cashflow, Trivago might find companies being more aggressive on customer acquisition. Trivago may benefit with these surges. I am buying shares and selling covered calls A 5.00. I believe 5.00 is my exit price for the stock as of right now. If something big happens like an adjacent expansion then this might move, but I am going to sell monthly covered call @ 5.00. # All my holdings: \u200b ( \u200b # Beaten Down Stocks Respond Aggressively to good news Often time stocks that are at all time lows just need a single small catalyst to respond aggressively to the upside. Gamestop's investment from Ryan Cohen is an example of a catalyst that drove a huge increase in Gamestop's game price. A few years ago Trivago was trading at \\~23.00 dollars per share. As of Friday it was trading around 3.00, an 87% decrease. As of two years ago, it was in the mid to high single digits. Revenue has steadily declined for a few years and the pandemic itself was no help. A new large partnership, or an adjacent product category expansion like airline travel or car rentals are a potential catalyst. The recovery will begin mid year ( \u200b ( \\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Expedia Numbers ( \u200b ( # The Ultimate Catalyst - TRAVEL Tax Credit # Currency Play Trivago's largest customer base is not the USA, it's Europe. I am optimistic that Earnings will be improved due to the weakness of the dollar. This isn't a major catalyst but a weak dollar is a reason to invest in foreign equities, especially considering the dollar will likely continue to weaken with additional stimulus and purposeful inflation. [ # TRIVAGO MANAGEMENT and LEANER Company Trivago has a healthy balance sheet of \\~200M cash Trivago had a net loss of 9M last quarter Trivago can maintain suppressed travel for quite a while and their low capital business model can flex quickly. # And Lastly, for the gay bears...... They give pricing in Vietnamese DONGS. Something you can't get enough of. \u200b # RISKS There are Risks- Trivago has seen revenue decline even pre pandemic, this is a play that assumes Trivago emerges stronger, that their new CEO has growth plans, that emerging markets play a significant role in the coming years and that other potential adjacent expansion happens.

{"text": "Firstly, I hope this doesn\u2019t get downvoted to oblivion. This is a genuine discussion I want to have to further help GME holder\u2019s understand the situation and provide clarity. This is in no shape or form financial advice, but my opinions on the stock and what has happened. I am holding 296 shares avg $37. Have we stopped to consider that the squeeze has already happened? That initial jump from 100s to 480 last week may have been most of the shorts covering. Shorts needed to cover approx 70 million shares. If you look at the volume day to day from last week, 70 million shares could have easily been covered, as these days have very high volume. This is even truer when you factor in brokerage restrictions. If retail couldn\u2019t buy, where was all of this crazy volume from? Most likely, it was the 70 million shares being covered. If it is revealed that the short interest is still 50% or higher, this may very well be because HF\u2019s took new short positions in the 400s 300s 200s. They are rolling in the green if this is the case. They probably bought options to also hedge against any potential issues. If this is the case, the short interest will appear the same on our end, but in order for a successful squeeze to take place organically, the price will potentially have to hit $500 organically for the new shorts to feel any pressure. In terms of percentage as well, the jump from early double digits to 480 for GME was a bigger percentage increase than VW\u2019s jump from 200s to 1000s. This solidifies further that the squeeze has happened, and the squeeze we saw was bigger than VW\u2019s in terms of percentage. I know a lot of people here got in 200+. So it would be great if we could get some solid discussion going on challenging what I\u2019ve said.

{"text": "In RKT DD Part 1, I discuss why and how RKT is being manipulated by institutions by way of shorting and by manufacturing negative narratives in effort to accumulate more shares for cheap. Refer to RKT DD Part 1 Below: In RKT DD Part II I discuss Rocket\u2019s infectious culture from an employee\u2019s (my own) perspective and why it will allow them to be the Amazon on Fintech. Refer to RKT DD Part II Below: [ Now I want to address you dumbasses who lump Rocket in with United Wholesale Mortgage Company and Loan Depot. LoOk HoW LoAn DePoT aNd UwMc ArE DoInG \u2013 MoRtGaGe CoMpAnIeS SuCk Listen you simpletons, Rocket Companies OWNS THE ENTIRE HOUSING ECOSYSTEM: From the Front end with their Rocket Homes business (Zillow, Redfin competitor) To the origination of the loan via Rocket Mortgage (whether direct to consumer or through their broker channel) To their Amrock title insurance business which orders the appraisals and title insurance To their Nexsys Solutions with tools that allow for Remote Online Notarization, enabling the mortgage process to be 100% digital And with their servicing business which allows them to think about their clients on a lifetime perspective rather than on just a transactional level. As they continue to grow their entire housing ecosystem, they are also leveraging their tech platform for other ancillary businesses such as Rocket Loans and Rocket Auto. Link to all of Rocket\u2019s companies below: [ Let\u2019s talk Rocket Auto: Investors mistakenly think that Rocket Auto hasn\u2019t launched Yet. It\u2019s true Rocket Auto hasn\u2019t launched publicly but it doesn\u2019t mean Rocket Auto hasn\u2019t launched. Rocket Auto currently handles all of VROOMs sales, marketing and customer service. Rocket even powers their e-commerce platform. They literally run every part of Vroom\u2019s business except for the delivery of the vehicle. If you look at VROOM\u2019s 10Q, you\u2019ll see that Rocket Auto inked a 4-year agreement with VRM. The deal enables RKT to receive up to 8,641,914 shares of Vroom common stock over the four-year period, in addition to a percentage of each car sold on Rocket\u2019s e-commerce platform. That\u2019s $430M worth of shares. Let\u2019s not forget that Gilbert was a very early investor in Vroom (2015) so we don\u2019t even know how much he already owns. See section of Vroom\u2019s 10Q below: Paragraph in VRM 10Q: \u201cOn May 15, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Rocket Auto LLC and certain of its affiliates (collectively, \u201cRocket\u201d) providing for the launch of an ecommerce platform under the \u201cRocket Auto\u201d brand for the marketing and sale of vehicles directly to consumers (the \u201cRA Agreement\u201d). The Company will list its used vehicle inventory for sale on the Rocket Auto platform, but all sales of the Company\u2019s inventory will be conducted through the Company\u2019s platform. Rocket Auto is expected to launch publicly during the first quarter of the year ending December 31, 2021 and, during the term of the RA Agreement, Rocket has agreed to ensure that not less than a minimum percentage of all used vehicles sold or leased through the platform on a monthly basis will be Vroom inventory. The Company issued Rocket 183,870 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock upon execution of the RA Agreement. The Company will pay Rocket a combination of cash and stock for vehicle sales made through the platform. Rocket may earn up to 8,641,914 shares of common stock over a four-year period based upon sales volume of Vroom inventory through the Rocket Auto platform.\u201d As you can see above Rocket Auto is supposed to launch publicly this quarter\u2026and what would be a better time to launch Rocket Auto than on Thursday\u2019s earnings report? A public launch of Rocket Auto, coupled with a large financial partnership announcement (this we know will happen) and maybe even an increase in their buy back. Can you imagine what would happen? Jay Farner tried to warn the bears: this is a stock you don\u2019t want to be short in. His warnings was much warranted. I do think Rocket will acquire Vroom \u2013 why would they negotiate such a large stock deal? Why wouldn\u2019t Rocket apply their 35 years of selling mortgages to the next most complicated transaction: auto sales. Regardless if they acquire Vroom or not, it\u2019s clear Rocket will be a big player in this arena which will fit their lead generation and sales model perfectly. Why is used car sales good for Rocket? Because Data, Data, Data. Rocket Plans to own 25% of the mortgage market (and they will probably pull credit on an additional 25% who either may not qualify or may choose to go to another lender). Rocket also pulls credit on clients who apply for personal loans via Rocket Loans Rocket can very easily have access to half of America\u2019s homeowners credit reports by 2030 \u2013 The jackpot of consumer data. What does a credit report tell you? It tells you if a client has an auto loan or lease and when that lease or loan will be paid off. This is extremely vital information that will allow Rocket to leverage their AI to cross sell across their platform. Look at the biggest e-commerce used car sales platform in America, Carvana. Their market cap is $50B. Carvana\u2019s market Cap is 30% higher than ALL OF Rocket\u2019s 15 companies combined! As I stated above, Rocket\u2019s sales model can easily be applied to car sales. If you read RKT DD part II (link above) then you know why Rocket would absolutely kill it in this arena, given their strong culture centered around hard work and customer focus \u2013 to the point of obsession. Meanwhile their AI will analyze the millions of data points collected and will tell them where to focus their marketing, who to contact / when to follow up. Executing these tasks may sound insignificant but when you have access to 25% of the world\u2019s credit reports, this information will vastly improve their conversion rate. Rocket is obsessed with improving their conversion rate, which is why they invested $500M in tech last year; their AI makes 1 million decisions per day and tells their highly ambitious army of sales people where to sell and how to sell in order to increase their conversions. Not to mention, Online sales of vehicles accounts for just 4.2 percent of total car sales\\\\.\\\\ We know millennials and gen z have been conditioned to want things delivered to their doorstep \u2013 and they HATE being sold. Can you think of a cheesier salesperson than a used car salesman at a dealership? E-commerce sales of care is the future. This sector that has not properly used technology and there is enough market share for Rocket Auto to be a dominate player regardless of Carvana\u2019s presence. Rocket Homes: WhY BuY RkT WhEn YoU CaN InVeSt In A FiNtEcH CoMpAnY LiKe ZilLoW: Dear smooth brain, please download \u201cRocket Homes\u201d on your phone and tell me the difference between Rocket Homes and Zillow. I\u2019ll admit, Rocket Homes probably won\u2019t be as big as Zillow and is currently only available in 21 states, but I guarantee it will grow faster than them.. because Zillow has just Zillow. Whereas Rocket owns the entire housing ecosystem and uses it to leverage relationships with realtors, insurance agents, brokers and lenders all on one platform. Rocket Homes has already been used for the sale and purchase of over 750,000 homes. I would love to see Zillow try and copy Rocket\u2019s flagship business the same way Rocket copied theirs. Do you think Zillow could originate $250B in loan volume? Maybe if you gave them a 20-year head start. I also would like to see Zillow try to get into used car sales, start and grow one of the largest title insurance businesses in the nation (Amrock), get into personal loans, connect brokers, lenders, realtors, and insurance agents on one app which can pull data from each, streamlining the mortgage process (Nexsys HOI, Rocket TPO) and expand internationally (Lendesk, Edison financial). Not going to happen. Yet Zillow is valued at $45B \u2013 A whopping 12 percent higher than ALL OF ROCKET\u2019s 15 COMPANIES COMBINED. Rocket\u2019s expansion internationally: Rocket continues to show its unmatched ambition, this time with its expansion into the Canadian mortgage Market, which is valued at $800B. We love our neighbors to the north but damnit is their technology lagging behind ours. Some of these hockey-stick wielding Canadian brokers are literally sifting through paper-copied rate sheets in some areas of the country. Rocket noticed this opportunity and launched a platform called Lendesk, which ties the lender and borrower together in the archaic Canadian mortgage and allows brokers to match clients with an ideal loan within seconds. Their market which is in a desperate need for an overhaul, and this Rocket\u2019s Lendesk fits the Bill. Unfortunately these dumbass mods won\u2019t let me post a YouTube video showing Lendesks technology in Canada. To view this video, you can refer to this same DD that I posted in [r/TeamRKT highlights the initiative Rocket is taking to further grow and diversify its businesses. And they are just getting started. Short Squeeze Originally RKT planned to go public with priced around $22-$23 per share, with 150mm shares \u2013 but due to weak demand they cut the IPO price to $18 AND the public float size to only 100M shares. Despite this smaller than expected float, they still have short interest above 30% - one of the highest shorted stocks on the market. To combat this unnecessary shorting, Rocket announced a $1B buyback; currently their float is $2B. First off, who even announces a buyback when they\u2019ve only been public for 3 months? This is unheard of. Rocket\u2019s float is currently $2B, so this buy back would cut their float IN HALF! So if Rocket Auto, a new financial partner and an increased buy back is announced on Thursday\u2019s earnings call, then how the hell are these shorts (35% of the float) going to cover? Initially the short narrative was that the lock-up expiration period would cause a $RKT sell off (like we saw with $PLTR and $FUBO). But that didn\u2019t happen. Gilbert owns over 75 percent of the shares and even he didn\u2019t sell. In fact, Gilbert even bought over $13M of additional stock at IPO in August \u2013 that\u2019s how much he believes in this company. Gilbert has a big ego \u2013 so much that he even publicly slammed Lebron James after LeBron left the Cleveland Cavs (which Gilbert owns). Gilbert also owns Fat Head, the company that sells life-sized wall stickers of professional athletes. After Lebron left, Gilbert reduced the Price of LeBron\u2019s Fathead to Benedict Arnold\u2019s Birth Year. Benedict Arnold is known as America\u2019s biggest trader. See Gilbert/LeBron Link Below: [ This was petty of Dan, but it shows he has a big ego that he wants to protect. Just like Lebron, these short sellers are messing with his ego and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s salivating at the thought of vengeance on this Thursday's call (Thursday, 2/25 after market close). Fun fact \u2013 even though Gilbert did this to LeBron and wrote a public letter to season ticket holders slamming James\u2019 departure, he was still able to get LeBron back on the Cavs a few years later and win an NBA championship\u2026 Gilbert is a winner. How else do you think he went from a pizza delivery boy to the fifteenth richest man in America? See link below: [ But why is Rocket stock still falling if they announced a $1B buyback? If they truly believe in this company, then why aren\u2019t they buying back shares at these these levels? Answer: because they likely can\u2019t buy back shares right now due to SEC regulations. Allow me to explain. According to the SEC, a company is not allowed to buyback shares if it is holding material information that has yet to be made available to the public. If a company does do this, then they may be charged with a form of insider trading. What is material information? Material information is any information that hasn\u2019t been disclosed publicly and may impact the stock price once released. What is Rocket's \"non-public material information\": The announcement of Rocket\u2019s big, new financial partner * The public launch and plans of Rocket Auto This information is likely to be made public on Thursday\u2019s earnings call and may send shorts scrambling to cover with whatever little shares remain in the public float. And to put fuel on the fire, Rocket may also simultaneously initiate a buy back, that is, if there are any shares left for purchase. Gilbert is the guy who publicly humiliated Lebron James for leaving the Cavs, imagine what he will do shorts who are tainting the image of the company he poured his life into. Say it with me now: Rocket Bears are Fucked. TDLR: this doesn\u2019t contain even a fraction of the information in this DD part three (or DD part one and two) but this dude does a good job summarizing RKT\u2019s situation.

This is the titan of titans, its finances are superb. Low debt, high equity, large and growing revenues in the most valuable and ever growing industry in the world. But thats enough fundamentals for WSB. Intel is still under the radar of most degens and the euphoria of the current market. It will gain favor, and it will gain favor soon. Do yourself a favor and buy INTC now and not at 100$ when its literally 30$ over all time high. I didnt mention it, but there is a chip shortage, and Patrick Gelsinger (one of the smartest people in silicon valley) is taking over this giant on the 15th.

{"text": "Alright retards I think there are some questions that need to be answered as far as GME goes. All that seems to become popular these past few days are diamond hand, \ud83e\udd8d together strong means GME will go to the moon. Look I love the memes as much as the next autist, but it seems as this is the only content in the sub right now. That and the repetitive DD about short interest still being high, short ladder attacks, and lies in the media. I know this is starting to sound negative, but I\u2019m not a \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b and believe in the OG GME DD, and am still holding my shares bought at $30, $140, and $240 levels, and I\u2019m not fucking selling\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50. With that being said though I still have some questions about the future of GME and hope these questions might bring a bigger picture to rest of the sub. I\u2019ll just list the questions below, looking forward to some answers. 1. What more can hedge funds do to drive down the price? We\u2019ve seen the short latter attacks, lies in the media, bots in our own sub. These institutions aren\u2019t going to back down and have the capital and capability to manipulate the market. So what else can we except going forward from these bastards? 2. Do retail investors have enough power against the hedge funds to come out on top? I\u2019ve seen figures where retail own about 30% of GME, (please correct me if I\u2019m wrong) but say that all 30% held is that enough to trigger the squeeze? 3. What is it like from the hedgies POV? They\u2019re obviously trying to trigger selling to help their short position, but what exactly does their short position look like? I am not well-versed and short positions but know the basics. So they\u2019ve borrowed shares that they eventually have buy back. What is the timeline on this? What is their penalty for delaying buying back the shares? 4. What exactly is happening with the brokerages and how much longer will this continue? Should have done more research on this, saw something about clearing houses, but can\u2019t read too good. Why is RobinHood limiting orders? Is it due to hedge fund pressure or something else? Luckily I have been on TD and haven\u2019t had problems, but majority of retail/WSB is on RH and these restrictions are hurting GME. What\u2019s going to happen going forward with RH? 5. Realistically is the SEC going to do anything about the market manipulation, with either Hedge Funds or Brokerages? If so how will it help GME? That\u2019s all I got for now. I\u2019ll update if I think of anything else. I apologize if these questions aren\u2019t relevant, have already been answered or are just plain stupid. I am a truly a retard. Would love for other people to comment any questions they have as well, so we can get a bigger picture of GME going forward.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-02-03 15:43:48", "id": "lbgs9s"}

{"text": "TLDR: Rich clients invested more money to feed the beast. Hold strong Full Article: BY REUTERS \u2014 8 MINUTES AGO By Svea Herbst-Bayliss BOSTON (Reuters) - Melvin Capital, the hedge fund at the center of the GameStop (GME) drama, lost 53% in January but received commitments for fresh cash from investors in the last days of the month, a source familiar with the fund said on Sunday. Melvin ended January with more than $8 billion in assets after having started the year with roughly $12.5 billion in assets, the source said. The firm, founded in 2014 by Gabe Plotkin, had bet that ailing video game retailer GameStop's (GME) stock, which traded at less than $5 five months ago, would fall. But a wave of retail investors, comparing notes on social media platform Reddit and using online trading app Robinhood, took the other side of Plotkin's trade to send the stock up 1,625% this month to close at $325 on Friday. The Wall Street Journal first reported the loss. Hedge funds Point72 Asset Management and Citadel gave a $2.75 billion capital infusion to Melvin Capital earlier in the week, enabling it to close out that position with a large loss. \"The fund's portfolio liquidity is strong. Use of leverage is at the lowest level since Melvin Capital's inception in 2014,\" the source said. As news of losses at many hedge funds spread in recent days, speculation mounted about which firms might be forced to shut their doors. Several investors and fund managers said clients have been more patient with certain firms that have a long and strong track record, likely allowing them to survive this month's deep losses.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-02-01 01:53:52", "id": "l9ez8j"}

{"text": "An important aspect of trading emotionally is valuing integrity and morality. An emotional trader must, above all else, think of the repercussions their investments may have on the world at large. Could you really sleep at night knowing that you are personally funding terrorists or child exploitation? The answer is no. _ The impact buying or selling shares has on other people is often conveniently overlooked. Mainstream investors, teachers, and self-proclaimed gurus choose to ignore the broader implications of these interpersonal interactions out of moral convenience. To them, that which is not seen, can do no harm. This culture of permissiveness is in violation of human dignity. Every trade that is made, every contract that is processed, is a personal transaction, that of which dates back to Babylonian times. The biggest implication of the result of this shift in perspective surrounds the idea of bag holding. Outside of the world of finance, bag holding refers to a form of common courtesy. That is, if you were to perhaps see an elderly woman holding many bags of shopping, one might partake in bag holding such that said elderly woman was disencumbered. In the realm of investing, this socially positive term has been twisted to refer to traders who refuse to sell shares cheaply. This term is often employed by market manipulators as well as losers who sold and are looking for reaffirmation that they are not alone in their losses. An interpersonal perspective helps an outsider understand what the emotional investor is doing, and sheds light on the concept of bag holding. Once again, human behavior imitates life. Kind-hearted individuals hold the metaphysical bags of those who cannot afford to (the \u201cold women\u201d in this metaphor). That is, those who are strong, have more wealth available to trade, take on the burden of those who cannot, the old women. Indeed a cold, heartless view of markets and investing may lead some to believe that it is okay to let old women struggle and fail whilst attempting to cross the street carrying groceries. However, experienced investors will attest to the moral duty we as humans must carry in the advancement, not only of ourselves, but of the weakest among us. Life changing realizations of this nature have powerful impacts on our lives. As a coping mechanism, I suggest to you that crying is the most efficient method of displaying sadness and sorrow in these situations, not selling. Sobs are a universal sign of distress, discontent, and loss. As such, tears may be seen as a commodity. Although an emotional investor will, at all times, avoid selling, and above all else, avoid being a loser, there are particular situations where there simply may not be a lesson to exchange for the sale of your position. That is to say, there may be nothing to learn. __ TLDR In days like today, an intelligent well-trained emotional investor will fall back to basic principles of loss aversion and exchange their losses for their value equivalent in tears. In fact, tears may be the most valuable commodity of all. Only losers sell. Serious investors learn. Serious investors cry.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-02-03 10:15:46", "id": "lbaqcq"}

{"text": "I got most of the answers for this DD from some Indian guy on Chegg, and copied them word for word. Alright, so Chegg has recently broke the $100 wall and has nicely ran up to an ATH before its earnings after market close on Monday. I believe that it's going to tank immediately after earnings. Why? Well, obviously their subscriber, revenue, and profit numbers are going to be great. Hell, everyone's been cheating with Chegg lately, paying $15 a month to access shitty homework answers. Nonetheless, they released similar spectacular numbers in October 2020, and immediately tanked from 87 to 77. Why? Because back then, they foresaw their growth slowing down in 2021. The slowing growth projections caused them to tank in the short term before recovering. Recent earnings from Unity ($U) and Peloton ($PTON), for example, are showing that even with stellar profits, PERFECT future guidance is important right now. Both of those ran up to earnings. Both nose-dived right after. And with Chegg diving on its last 2 run-ups to earnings, I don't see why this time will be any different. TL;DR: Chegg is running up to an all-time high before earnings. The reopening of schools in the somewhat-near future will probably provide a slight damper to its growth projections. Last 2 earnings tanked from ATH's for the same reason. Recent earnings like Unity and Peloton show even slightly toned-down growth projections tank the stock despite good profits. A put debit spread is the way to go with this one. Positions: $CHGG 2/19 100/105 Put Debit Spread for $260 (selling 2/19 $100P, buying 2/19 $105P) You could also YOLO the 2/19 $90P for $200. If the stock tanks, it's probably going to at least $90.

{"text": "NOK will colonize the moon and bring 4G to barbaric aliens! NASA selected Nokia exclusively to build the first cellular network on the moon. [ First, in regards to Nokia\u2019s business. Nokia, unfortunately, doesn\u2019t manufacturer phones anymore. Nokia sold the right to produce Nokia branded phones to HMD Global while retaining the right to have some input. Nokia\u2019s current business concentrates on mobile networks such as 5G, network infrastructures, and cloud services. In other words, Nokia business pertains to the most basic component of our modern civilization. Especially so the Post-COVID world where networking is even more important than before. Think of the Tesla cars. They are connected to AT&T cellular networks which are built by Nokia. Nokia will be leading the networks that would eventually enable automation. And when that happens, Nokia will have a continuous revenue stream. [ Nokia is leading mobile networks with 27% of the world (excluding China) market share of 4G and 5G. It currently holds more than 3000k patents for 5G. Nokia other major competitors are Ericson, Huawei, and ZTE. Some countries of the Western hemisphere and the G7 banned Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE from operating in their countries. I suspect this will continue in the future. Leaving us with only Nokia and Ericson. But couldn\u2019t a Mega-Cap such as Google or Tesla somehow eliminate NOK and ERIC? NOK holds more than 3000 patents already. So there is a strong barrier of entry into such a business. That won\u2019t happen unless Nokia licences a patent for such a company. In this hypothetical scenario, the Mega-Cap would have to acquire Nokia. Which in turn will raise the price of the stock. I think this is the case that is similar to MSFT under Ballmer\u2019s where the stock price was stagnant for many years. But slowly surged under Nadella. Though given the catalyst of COVID-19, I think the surge will happen quicker with NOK. At 4.53 a share. NOK P/E ratio is 30.81x. Which is a small discount in comparison with the S&P 500 which has P/E ration of about 39x. This establishes Nokia not only as a growth stock but also as a value stock. The lowest that NOK dropped to was 2.34. Which happened back in March. At the current price, I believe that NOK is well within the margin of safety. With that being said, there are some problems that should be addressed. The income trend in the past few years is problematic. But this can offset by the fact that NOK has contracts well into the future with many nations states and private companies that should generate ample income until NOK is able to eliminate Huawei and ZTE and in turn, dominate the market (With Ericson). Also, Nokia is spening billions on research The second complication is that Biden or other G7 leaders could potentially reverse Trump\u2019s ousting of Huawei and ZTE. I don\u2019t think this is likely. But it\u2019s certainly a possibility. But even if it happens. Nokia will still have a big market share. And 100% market share of the moon and will always have a priority over Huawei and ZTE for government projects for reasons of national security. Also, there is a substantial amount of money spent on R&D which will I believe will be a catalyst in the future surge in NOK. It should be worth noting that just one day after RH banned NOK, Blackrock released an amendment to their ownership of NOK. Increasing their shares by 21,140,777 shares. Form SC 13G/A Nokia Corp. Published: 2020-02-05 12:16:19 [ And the new one showing the increase. Form SC 13G/A Nokia Corp. Published: 2021-01-29 17:21:09 [ Even though at this point Blackrock owns 5% of practically everything. The increase is a good question. Now you might ask me why not Ericson? ERIC is also a good stock. But I see more value in NOK. Also, the fact the NOK is working on 1 Terabit per second internet, and that it will bring 4G to the moon, and the fact that Nokia is #1 by patterns give it an edge in innovative growth.

{"text": "Disclaimer: The words together below form the prophesies of a heretic, and are meant to shine light in the darkness. They are not my words alone, but the words of all. Thus, these words do not constitute financial or investment advise. In the Beginning In the beginning, the markets were created. They existed in relative balance and beauty, providing a means for investors to participate in the steering of the present towards a better future. This happened organically through investment choices. The markets were a tool that aided investors in fulfilling the measure of their being created, by allowing them to create their own world. This balance and beauty began to crumble in time, as various individuals and groups of individuals conspired to persuade and even control the decisions of investors. Over time, they would be successful through the deployment of unquestioned measurement metrics for value, and countless media campaigns. And here and now, we stand. \u200b The Supermassive Black Hole The markets stand on the precipice of deconstruction. Like all things in existence, and much like the universe itself, nothing lasts in any single state. Deconstruction and reconstruction happen at every given moment, sometimes in small cycles, and sometimes... in revolutionary ones. We are on the cusp of a moment unseen by any other generation before us. The markets begin their journey to a singular, previously invisible, stock. This is happening at an increased rate, and ALL parties feel its influence. Individual investors, traders, and gamblers are pouring money in by the droves. Larger institutions are doing the same. Even hedge funds, some of whom have doubled or even tripled down on their positions, add to the mass of this one security. News outlets continue to cover the story. Even the news that is hypothesized to go against this event, heads towards it and increases the power of its vacuum. This very post does the same, even without my mentioning the name of the security. \u200b The Death of WallStreet The Supermassive Black Hole Event ends how all things end: deconstruction (death). This could happen slowly, or it could happen very abruptly. Many will attempt to escape it, but nothing can. This event cannot be stopped. It can only be delayed or change form. Eventually, when the mass becomes too great, hedge funds will be obliged via margin calls to liquidate their assets (their clients' assets), in order to repay their loans to the institutions from which their moneys were acquired. Not all clients, though, as some could theoretically be protected by moving their positions to select safety securities. This is likely to cause a market downtrend, and eventually a crash. Again, this could happen slowly, very quickly, or at any pace in between. SEC will no-doubt intervene. The US government will also do so. We will also see brokers intervene in an attempt to slow what is happening. These efforts will all contribute to the event. Though the person who gets out first mitigates the greatest potential loss, you'll find no admonishment in this prophesy to do so. The hedge funds and big money will attempt to do so, and are in the process of doing so. This is the light that is shined before you, to show you who lurks in the corners and seeks to rob you of freedom through calculated steps to keep you in poverty! \u200b The Birth of FreeStreet And lastly, I bring glad tidings. This event will happen, regardless of any efforts. In the end, there will be a rebirth of the markets, more free, balanced, and beautiful than ever before. Wealth will be redistributed to some degree, but that was never the point here. And most importantly, a we will see the dawn of a new age. An age where people democratically elect the future of their own time, and the legacy they leave behind. May the irons with which ye are laden be struck from yer wrists.

{"text": "TLDR; Melvin and gang hasn't covered shit. They've been illegally \"closing out\" their short positions and if we hold they will 100% get fucked. There is far more nefarious shit at play. So this morning I saw the S3 and Ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for GME. This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above ~120% short interest still. I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close >50% of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week. This got me digging around to figure out what's up. I started by looking into GME failed to delivers (i.e. short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock) for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan, GME had ~1.2 MILLION failed to delivers. This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying. What was interesting though, is that of that ~1.2million, ~700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period. I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months. It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road. Having spent some time looking at the pattern, it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in, then a small chunk of coverage, then another large amount, and so on. To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article: In it, a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME: \"Assuming that XYZ (e.g. GME) is a hard to borrow security (e.g. apes holding strong), and that Trader A (Melvin), or its broker-dealer, is unable (apes again) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A\u2019s clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer\u2019s close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options. These trades are commonly referred to as \u201creset transactions,\u201d in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases. Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm\u2019s responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.\" It's almost like a play by play of what we've seen (in combination with the ladder attacks). My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th. I 100% think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud. In fact, I would bet all my money on it - oh wait, I did 96 GME @ 290. I am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail. More DD: Not a financial adviser, I eat paint chips for dinner EDIT: Ok, so I've been reading some comments and I wanted to clear a couple things up: The failed to deliver number is reported cumulatively. So if you sum everything for the Jan time period it'd come out incorrectly as 5 million. What I'm doing is summing all the debits to get an aggregate view of all the failed to delivers in the time range. This process is validated and discussed in other /r/wsb posts I know ETF's could have been redeemed by some MM's to gather up GME stock. However I'm not convinced there is enough GME held in ETF's to be a significant factor. Someone in the comments reported this amount to be about ~10M. We would know if a bunch of ETF's rebalanced and dumped GME. My number for the Ortex short interest was incorrect, I got mixed around when I wrote this initially. The short interest reported by Ortex on Friday morning was ~80%. The 120 figure for S3 was correct. Please checkout the linked DD - it goes into much more detail and covers things far better than I can. Share this post and the related DD. We need to hold wall street accountable if this is true and I think that starts by spreading the word. I'm going to continue to dig into this tonight / tomorrow. Look forward to a new post tomorrow evening. If I take an L to 0, I take an L to 0. I don't invest what I can't lose. But you can bet your ass I'll be holding till this blows open.

{"text": "You\u2019re going to get destroyed in the end game here. Inflation is NOT \u201cprices rising.\u201d Prices do not expand. They increase. This definition was changed by economists to shift blame away from their money printing policies. Inflation is an expansion of the money supply. An effect of that expansion is rising prices. It\u2019s cause and effect, not direct definition. All that printed money is currently in the stock market and it will stay there until it comes pouring out due to a crash or financial crisis. I went through a McDonalds drive through the other day for the first time in a while and prices were easily 20-30% higher than 6-8 months prior. That\u2019s just one of at least 10 examples. So on the consumer side there is pulse of what\u2019s to come. However whether we get massive hyper inflation or massive deflation depends on what the Fed does. If the Fed chooses full fuckup speed ahead to save the stock market, the dollar will be sacrificed to achieve that goal. Sure the stock market will go high, but those dollars will be worthless so it won\u2019t mean anything. Or it could let the market collapse which would save the dollar. But every politicians career would be over because \u201cthey did nothing.\u201d Which is more likely? Something is going to get sacrificed and someone will be holding the bag. Be ready for both scenarios. The IMF could step in with the Special Drawing Right which is gold backed (sort of).

{"text": "Lots of Robinhood talk, of course. Here's the dilemma a lucky/unlucky few are facing and why you should help. I, like several others, turned a joke YOLO into a fortune. Like $5k to $200k in a few weeks. Cool. And now I'm stuck. If I transfer my shares and options to, say, Fidelity, I lose a week where my shares are locked. Oh, I'll still be able to watch my stock go up and down in Robinhood, but I won't be able to sell anything. That's normal and not shady, it's exactly how any broker would handle it. And under normal circumstances, this wouldn't be an issue. But these are obviously not normal times. Anyone want to lock up their account for the next week and watch what happens, unable to do anything? No. If we hit the moon and everyone sells by Friday, I'll be lucky to get access to my shares the following Monday. Just in time for this thing to come back to earth. I could sell everything I have in Robinhood, but that still takes me out for a few days, since the funds need to settle that day, plus 2 additional days. Then, I can send the $ to a different broker. Even if that last part is instant, we're still talking about over 2 days. Again, anyone want to bet on where we'll be in 2 days. If I sell at $300 and this thing makes it to $700 by Tuesday, I'm fucked if I try to buy back in on Wednesday. And don't forget - if I sell my options and shares, I give them to the shorts, which hurts everyone. So what to do? Well, I'm obviously stuck for now. But you CAN help. If you're in Robinhood and not in my situation, you can leave ASAP. Robinhood is restricting buying GME again tomorrow, so you can't get it there anyway. If you want to buy, switch to Fidelity or Vanguard or someone and buy there. On top of that, if Robinhood is 100% innocent (HUGE leap of faith there), we overwhelmed them and they actually do need people to leave so people who remain can buy GME again (obviously I won't). If this is simply a clearing house issue and they needed funds to be able to settle due to the massive volatility, the only thing that helps them is if people stop buying GME on their app. And since the whole motto is BUY and HOLD, you really shouldn't be using Robinhood. So again: if you can, please leave Robinhood because I can't.

I did last year and was wrong but if you look at their current path to profitability it intersects hard with Pluto tv and Viacomcbs production capacity for streaming additional content. from the library licensing deals to the possibility of a new Chapelle show on Netflix owned in part by viac as part of a big deal with Dave to the Pluto TV Narcos deal cited in the last earnings call we can see a huge leap forward for streaming overall based entirely on the NFLX VIAC relationship. Monetization is a long term process for some of these pieces of big content and after a period of time it will no longer add new subs like narcos. But Pluto Tv can help with ad based monetization and no sub or sign in required. If you look at the overall package we see that more shows could follow like ozark or maybe a sopranos channel for syndication like monetization a&e tried with no cursing but fuck that shit.

{"text": "Hey y'all. I wrote a post yesterday about TSM and the current automotive semiconductor shortage that you can check out here: [ The gist was that TSM is the biggest producer of semiconductors which are experiencing a huge shortage right now, and that the Biden administration is looking into \"immediate action\" to fix the shortage. I think this will be great for TSM's stock price in the coming weeks. One question I got was: how does American intervention benefit TSM? My answer: The Chips for America Act. The Chips for America Act intends to encourage domestic production of semiconductors and was passed as part of the most recent defense spending bill last month. The act has already been authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act and last week American semiconductor manufacturers wrote Biden a letter to fund it. [ Section 9905 of the act is titled FUNDING FOR DEVELOPMENT AND ADOPTION OF MEASURABLY SECURE SEMICONDUCTORS AND MEASURABLY SECURE SEMICONDUCTORS SUPPLY CHAINS and here are some screenshots. \u200b \u200b You can look at the whole act here: [ Basically the act creates a fund that can give TSM $$$ to supply the US with semiconductors, and allocates funds to \"secure the supply chain,\" i.e. secure it against China. Closer US ties to TSM is great for the company since one of the main concerns investors have over TSM is the possibility of a Chinese takeover.

Taiwan is home to the largest semiconductor manufacturing industry in the world, and also relies on U.S. weapons to defend against China, which views it as part of its territory and has threatened to use force if Taipei moves toward formal independence. The Biden administration has also asked U.S. embassies around the world to identify how foreign countries and companies that produce chips can help address the global shortage and to map the steps taken to date, the spokesperson added.

Fed to test bank ability to withstand 55% fall in equity price Fed knows of the inflation spike and they will have to react S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratio In Yale economist and Nobel laureate Robert Shiller\u2019s book Irrational Exuberance, he introduced a price/earnings ratio for the S&P 500 that averages inflation-adjusted earnings over the prior ten year. Today\u2019s Shiller P/E multiples are the highest they have been in two decades. Dot com bubble: 44 Today: 35 Warren Buffett\u2019s favorite valuation metric, a simple ratio of the total U.S. stock market capitalization to annual gross domestic product, effectively gives market watchers a reference point for current prices. The current stock market value of $42 trillion, compares to annual GDP of $21 trillion. One year after the dot-com bubble popped, Buffett said the unprecedented highs should have served as a strong warning signal. \"If the ratio approaches 200%\u2014as it did in 1999 and a part of 2000\u2014you are playing with fire,\" said Buffett. Current Buffet Indicator: 195% Dot com bubble Indicator: 159% Margin debt balances have exploded on Wall Street, recently hitting an all-time high of $778 billion\u2014nearly 37 times the $21 billion investors held in March 2000. However, the more important metric to focus on is margin debt to cash in customer accounts. It\u2019s currently at 72% more debt than cash, versus 79% at the peak of the dot-com bubble. Speculation is contagious Among stock market indicators the put/call ratio measures the weekly volume of put options, which are purchased when investors think stocks will fall, divided by the call option volume, contracts purchased by bullish investors Currently the put/call ratio is 0.4, nearly identical to the 0.39 it registered in March 2000, at the peak of internet stock buying mania. S&P market-cap concentration is at an all-time high, making index-tracking funds, which represent trillions of dollars in market value, extremely vulnerable to swings in just a few companies. Today, the top five\u2014Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla and Facebook\u2014make up 21% of the index\u2019s total market capitalization, even more than the 18% of market value commanded by the five biggest in 2000, when Microsoft, Cisco, General Electric, Intel and Exxon Mobil were on top.

I don't know whether it was legitimate users or bots posting them. Meanwhile, Finra had no new results and were still showing the old short interest value for some reason. Now, Finra has finally updated and came up with a 78.46% short interest, definitely more expected since it's very reasonable to think that at least some hedgefunds have not covered their shorts. What interests me about this difference of almost double is that it seems to speak of obvious market manipulation from the hedge funds.

{"text": "Today was a crazy ride, and we've all been following the action the entire time. My opinion is that unless I can find compelling evidence that the squeeze is truly done for and off the table, my conviction has only grown stronger. Most important things that stick out, all of which really build a case that must not be dismissed: 1) If shorts have covered, we should have noticed reasonable strong upwards momentum, as buying pressure consists of short covering along with retail buying, and a limited float. 2) Past few days we've seen trading volumes below average, likely suppressed demand caused by broker restrictions on buying. Lower volume can make any dump pull the price down easily. Especially when the demand side is getting locked out. Have to mention the timing of which Robinhood locked buying last week as well, coinciding with a massive dip. 3) Look at this image we would see greater variance. This correlation to me looks like obvious manipulation by higher frequency and higher volume algorithmic trading. It's hard to look at these charts and say that this is natural supply and demand. Seriously, same candlestick patterns on unrelated stocks. This price action is influenced by targeted manipulation to a high degree. Even if people were really selling off like crazy, wouldn't we see more natural candles? 4) We have mainstream media (MSM) covering the \"reddit mania\" extensively. MSM says reddit is trying to squeeze silver, which is false. You will not find anyone pushing to buy SLV on reddit. In fact, you will see a warning about silver and how many HFs have long positions in it. 5) We've seen an influx of bots on social media (reddit, FB, twitter) promoting silver, spamming that GME squeeze is finished, diverting attention away from the more uninformed audience. Why? If it's finished why the need for these? 6) MSM says the short squeeze mania is over and shorts have covered. If that is true, why are we seeing trade restrictions still on more and more brokers, and nonstop coverage all over TV and the internet. If it's over, why are there so many articles bashing retail to stay away? 7) GME is an outlier in the \"failed-to-deliver\" statistic, and has been put on NYSE short restriction (uptick rule). Something fishy is going on with the shares in the float. 8) SI% numbers are very conflicting. Especially the numbers that came around 30-50%. It was then later mentioned by someone in S3 that a different calculation was used. If you convert to the old calculation, you still get over 100% SI%. Why are they trying to change it all of a sudden? To me, this is enough to say we're still in the game. If it's over, let them prove it by crushing GME to $20 and on February 9th we hear the official SI% being low. Then it's finished. Something tells me that it's not over, and this is all a ploy to mitigate the damage they are about to receive when GME eventually triggers the MOASS. Can't say for sure it's a 100% trip to the moon and beyond, but what's really suggested otherwise? This whole misinformation campaign + price manipulation combo is too important to dismiss.

{"text": "\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udd8dhere. I wrote some basic advice I'll repost here for any newbies who want to get in on the action, or anyone who bought high and is for whatever dumb reason thinking about paper-handing. Paper-handing is fundamentally bad investment practice, especially if you're a new investor. I'll explain why. DISLAIMER: I've only been trading for a few years and I only know this shit because I have a mentor in finance who taught me this stuff, and he hasn\u2019t steered me wrong yet. So take it for what it\u2019s worth... But based on all the fact that paper-handing is even an issue here, you apes clearly need this advice. EDIT: These are \"fundamentals\" to the way I trade, but obviously everyone's trading strategy is different. Note that this is a quantitative approach to investing, which doesn't encourage YOLO-ing. This is ONE WAY to invest which does not require you to \"outsmart\" the general public by spotting opportunities/value before the market does. I feel it's particularly relevant to the GME play. The ticker symbol is less important than what you do with it. There are other approaches (which often require more experience) but I feel this is most accessible to new investors. GME is the hot stock right now but this applies to everything. Well, everything that you don\u2019t think will go bankrupt or get delisted. New traders, or people who are thinking of becoming new traders, should read this. Especially if you're new, I think you should follow these guidelines to avoid losing serious money in the stock market. This applies to all stock, not just GME. If you're experienced, it might just sound like I'm explaining at length why 2 + 2 = 4, but since a friend of a friend told me he paper-handed on GME (sold the dip), I feel compelled to explain why what he did was a bad idea. I would encourage people to buy GME, but only with money you are willing to say goodbye to for a while. (edit: in addition, just to reiterate, keep plenty of money in reserve so you can buy more if the stock goes down) By this I mean NEVER SELL AT A LOSS. Simply hold or buy more to bring your cost average down. All newbie investors (IMO) should adhere to this rule just in general. Buy stock prepared to ride it into the ground, or don\u2019t buy it at all. Many investors, myself included, follow this rule religiously, not just with GME but with all stocks. I have never lost money in the stock market because I never sold at a loss, I just held or bought more. COVID crashed the market while my portfolio was maxed out? I just held and was fine... should have bought more. If everyone bought into GME with this mindset, I bet it would go to Pluto easily. If you sell at a loss, you are donating to the \"save the short sellers\" fund out of your own wallet, fucking yourself over and betraying your fellow apes, and you\u2019re not even following sound investment practice. Just chain yourself to that rocket and enjoy. If you\u2019re thinking of investing so much that you\u2019ll wuss out, poop your diaper and smash the sell button with shaking paper hands at the slightest hint of red... just don\u2019t. Emotion and the stock market do not mix well. Stop losses (below purchase price) are also for pansies and genuine idiots. \u201cI\u2019ll sell you some stock... but only if you give me a bad enough price on it.\u201d Your plan should be to BUY when the stock goes down... if you feel like you need a stop loss, you're investing more than you should. Instead of being stupid, maybe try investing less and keep money in reserve so you can buy the dips. Side note: personally, in the case of GME, I don\u2019t have any limit sells either. From what I can tell on past short squeezes, the price seems to go parabolic for at least half a day before coming back down. So as long as you keep an eye on GME when it actually does skyrocket, you should have plenty of time. Set price alerts and relax. No need to shoot yourself in the foot by ditching the rocket mid-launch. Although, if you want you can try to profit off GME volatility. Some people are getting shamed for taking profits but I'm not sure they deserve it. As far as I know, buying low and selling high doesn\u2019t really help HFs, it drives the price up (just not as much as buying and holding). But personally, my philosophy is, I can take baby profits anytime... who knows when something like this GME rise will happen again. So I\u2019m holding (101 shares at cost average $106/share). Want to get into the game now? You could always just buy a few shares, and keep the rest of what you\u2019re willing to invest in reserve in case of a dip. And buy a little bit more each time it goes down more, bringing your cost average down. Ideally, you should always have a loose plan for how much you will buy at each phase if the stock goes down to near zero. Always try to keep cash in reserve. Locked yourself in at a high price? That's why you keep cash in reserve so you can buy the dip and average down. Didn't keep any cash in reserve? Guess you're stuck waiting for one of three things: 1) the short squeeze which will likely (though not certainly) happen, 2) for the price of GME to rise naturally over years as the value of the company increases, or 3) you get your hands on some more cash you're willing to say goodbye to bring your cost average down. DO NOT SELL AT A LOSS and you will never lose (edit: well, seldom, if ever. Unless the company goes bankrupt, a rare occurrence. This is why you don't put all your eggs in one basket, and plan so even if you buy all the way down to zero, it won't swallow your portfolio. Also, if you truly fucked up and used money that you need for health insurance or something, you may just have to back at least partially out with your tail between your legs and consider it a lesson). Hedge funds and billionaires know this, that's why their wealth increased so dramatically during the pandemic. They bought the dip while regular folks paper-handed and got even poorer. One more little trick. If you manage to scoop up a nice juicy 100 shares, then even if your position goes \u201cunderwater,\u201d you can always sell covered calls at above your average cost, bring DOWN your cost basis, and make money off your stock \u201crisk free\u201d while still following the rule of never sell at a loss. Make sure they are covered, i.e. you hold onto the actual stock for the duration of the call, otherwise it\u2019s extremely risky. Although if you sold even a covered call right this second the risk would be missing out on a once in a lifetime historic short squeeze. Bear in mind though it may take months for the squeeze to actually happen, and you'll need to be patient and, like I said before, say goodbye to your money for a while. EDIT: Just to reiterate, there are many trading strategies and I just feel this is one of the best for newbies. Trade however you want, just don\u2019t paper hand GME. I would also note that you can sell some shares below your cost basis and still follow this rule, if your sell is paired with a buy order that you executed at a lower price. It still follows the rule of \"don't sell at a loss.\" Buy one share at $90 and sell it at $100, doesn't matter if you still have 100 shares in the red from earlier. You can even (slowly) take your cost basis down by doing the thing where you buy a share when it goes down 5%, and sell one when it goes up 5%. EDIT: Yes I know about opportunity cost. It does apply if you know something the general public doesn\u2019t (rare if you\u2019re just a low IQ ape but GME was/is an exception). Many traders make money hopscotching between stocks regardless of loss but unless you know something the market doesn't, it could be a coin flip whether you'll hit rock bottom. In an ideal world, you can keep some money in reserve so you don\u2019t have to realize losses to jump on new opportunities. Yes I know about (and agree with) the sunk cost fallacy. My point is about gradually buying as the stock depreciates and becomes a better deal, lowering the cost basis, not \u201cdoubling down\u201d on sunk cost. Tl;dr \ud83e\udd8dbuy \ud83c\udf4c, don\u2019t give \ud83d\udc0d \ud83c\udf4c unless \ud83d\udc0d give more than \ud83e\udd8dpay for \ud83c\udf4c Not financial advice.

{"text": "As some of you may know, Keith Gill, the 34 year old guy known as \"DeepF-ingValue\" from this forum was the driving force behing GME (1750% in 8 days!) who made the hedge fund owners despair and firmly ruined them. After the GME story and Gill, we can take a closer look to his notes: \u200b Source: The Wall Street Journal \u200b Zoom from the Original Notes but I think that TAAT has the tools to become a \"disruptor\". A company that can fundamentally change an entire industry, just as Tesla did in the automotive market and Beyond Meat in the food market. They invented a cigarette that is used completely without tobacco and without nicotine, but should taste like a real cigarette. Market entry is not years away as some will be possible know: No, already rolled out in the state of Ohio. Are Tesla and Beyon Meat correctly valued on the stock exchange per today? That can certainly be discussed. What is certain, however, is that they have the advantage of being the \"first mover\" in their sectors and they have changed them forever. Also at TAAT Lifestyle and Wellness Ltd. I see this entry into the billion dollar tobacco industry. Therefore the statement from the CEO of TAAT ( SETTI COSCARELLA ) is by no means a pipe dream for us: >\"Anything under a 5 million dollar market value for TAAT would be a disappointment to me!\" If Tesla or Beyond Meat have too few similarities to TAAT \u2122, there is a very good example from this industry. Recently there was an IPO on the NYSE of a company with the relatively unimaginative name of RLX Technology Inc. (NYSE: RLX). The company develops and sells e-cigarettes and related products in China. The company will make about 160 million USD in profit in 2020, that's about 10 cents per share, which in turn results in a crisp P / E ratio of around 250! Don't you also believe that the tobacco-free and therefore nicotine-free cigarette such as the TAAT Lifestyle and Wellness Ltd. (WKN: A2P6PR) manufactures in a patent-pending process, could possibly be far more successful than a vile e-cigarette? If so, then one should use the P / E ratio of 250 to determine the value of TAAT Lifestyle and Wellness Ltd. (WKN: A2P6PR) and can definitely consider this information. Only 10 million annual profits would justify a market value of 2.5 billion, which corresponds to a share price of almost 30 dollars and has moon potential. Sounds crazy, but it's true. Check also this Breaking news: 60% of tobacco retailers who have carried taat for three or more weeks have placed REORDERS tobacco industry facing total upheaval! The focus is actually on TAAT Lifestyle and Wellness Ltd. (NYSE: A2P6PR)! The Taat Beyond Tobacco \u2122 cigarettes are a special class in this field, a tobacco-free cigarette that smells and tastes like a \"real cigarette\" and at the same time eliminates negative elements such as the addictive nicotine content, even though it is made from 100% natural ingredients! In the end, I am not a financial advisor so don't take anything for granted and invest only what you can afford to lose in a worst case scenario. But for this one I am sure we could potentially see 10x if not even 100x gains at some point. This stock has a noble cause. If you look at Steve Jobs and Elon Musk people stuck with them because they have a \"noble cause\" (there was a study that Apple users had the same brain scan when discussing Apple or discussing religion). TAAT's founder Joe seems to be a good face to lead this \"noble cause\" of saving people from nicotine.

{"text": "TLDR: 56% of asset flows into global markets come from passive vehicles like ETF\u2019s and buy and hold strategies with minimal turnover. With increased passive flows into the market, this means that by finding upcoming additions to ETF\u2019s and these strategies, you can front run ETF additions and reap the gains that come with that. My positions: PSTG Bought 50 May calls @$30 Sold 25 may put spreads @ $25/$20 Net credit: $1,735 Max Loss: 8k Max Gain: unlimited Target Price: $40-$45 next 3m, $75 year end NNDM [ Bought 30 May calls [u/20, and APPS ([ ) And for an update on how those went, XME is at $33 and some change, and APPS is pushing $64. Both exceedingly met my minimum targets. But back to what this post is really all about. Today I am here to bring to light my background in finance and 2 additional stock picks for this year and into 2022 so you fucks can reap the tendies from the unintended inefficiencies our great investment industry has brought about. So without further or do: Since 2000 the investment management industry has heavily pushed for passive investing from managers like BlackRock and Vanguard, in order to deal with the double-edged blade of underwhelming performance and high fees. Several studies have been made over the years that found that the investor\u2019s #1 enemy was themselves, with Fidelity finding that the average investor return the past 20 years being roughly 2.5%, (primarily because investors would jump in and out of investments during moments of panic (08 for example). While the S&P rose 7.5% annualized during the same time period. However, the utter destruction of value in 08, led to a massive transition to passive investment vehicles to \u201cdiversify risk exposures\u201d and a further push towards a buy and hold mentality. When you look back at the data during these periods, investors who jumped out at or near the bottom of 08, didn\u2019t recover until after 2012, where investors who held the whole time recovered by 2010. Today, we have roughly 56% of assets flows into the market entering from these passive vehicles, which is up from 23% back in 2007. \\ \\below is a link covering how passive funds have now exceeded the actively managed funds in the market. Further research on this can be found in CFAI's research database. [ \\*for clarification on what I mean by passive flows, these are ETFs, index, or strategy that purpose is to track a basket of stocks or securities with minimal turnover. Additionally, these include assets held in retirement accounts, brokerage accounts, pensions, and other asset manager portfolios. Because of this massive increase in passive flows, this ironically brings some new trading opportunities and risks to the individual/institutional investor that was not immediately present: 1. This massive indexation of assets increases correlations among securities to a degree in which you need machine learning techniques to fully understand relationships 2. Illiquidity risk: the buy and hold strategy also depletes the available supply of stocks in the market. As we saw with GME, at least 45% of the total supply was held by 10 different asset managers in their ETF portfolios, Thus reducing the amount of stock available to borrow and increasing the probability of these short squeeze situations. The downside to this is that should everyone panic or have a need for cash, you get violent downward moves like we had last March due to supply being flooded into the market. 3. Once you understand the metrics used to find new additions to these portfolio strategies, one can front-run additions to passive strategies, causing massive gains. Point 3 is where I really want to hit on. With all the data available to us, finding opportunities to front-run passive funds because much easier. As we have seen with Cathy Wood and Ark Investment Management, she is a pop star in finance now. People flock to her stock picks just because of the calls she made\u2026 But the best part? Other Investment managers now want a piece of that action. So this is where I bring you to my stock picks: NNDM and PSTG These are two sub-$30 stocks in her Ark fund ETF portfolios that are being added to BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelity, and Jp Morgan\u2019s upcoming innovation funds. These funds mimic and add leverage to the ARK funds such as JPM\u2019s 3x ARKK fund, or hold the same/similar holdings. NNDM is an Israeli tech company and has been on a rampage since October when ARK started adding it to their portfolios. Usually, ARK continues adding to their portfolios over a 1-3y timeline and holds for a minimum of 3 years. This sucker could easily continue to pop up as more positions are added. PSTG is another addition ARK has been making in their funds, tech company based near Silicon Valley, delivers data storage, encryption, and protection solutions in block-storage. Given the rise to this specialized form of data management, this a solid long-term bet on the transition of the tech industry. Both of these stocks have solid futures because of the innovation tilts they have. But in the mean-time, thanks to the low price and cheap call options on these stocks. This is definitely something to take advantage of before they begin to get expensive. If you followed my previous posts, you know I like taking a relatively lower risk, high return bets with minimal upfront output. So my plays are as follows: PSTG: target 3months $40-$45, year end- $75 Bought 50 May calls @$30 Sold 25 may put spreads @ $25/$20 Net credit: $1,735 Max Loss: 8k Max Gain: unlimited Risks: Due to the credit spread, this locks up a significant margin and as such, if the stock falls between the spread by expiration, you will need to coffer up the difference. So even though you are being paid 1.7k for making this play, you will be taking significant risks should it fall between the spread and you are on margin. Good to have cash handy should you decide to do a trade like this. I recommend buying puts to hedge out the possibility of a market dump, this will dilute your net credit received, but you have protection. NNDM: Target -3months: $50, year end $60 Bought 30 May calls @$20 Sold 75 May put spreads @ $17.5/$12.5 Bought 50 march puts @$10 Net Credit: $7k Max Loss: Occurs between $10 \u2013 $12.5: 24k Max gain: unlimited. Risks: Again because there is a spread, we do have the same margin lock-up provision. However, adding the puts below $10 provides some insurance should we have a market dump. The goal here is to offset the costs of the spread with there being a market dump and thus, be neutral at the end. These trades are primarily to take advantage of the additions that investment managers will be making later this year. This will passively push prices upwards on a quarterly basis. With March on the way, its a solid time to get in prior to the quarterly addition So degens, here are two trades for you for the year, and more yet to come. Keep hedged and get them tendies. Side note: I'll update in quarterly intervals. My time horizons are generally 3 months long in order to fully take advantage of how investment managers reallocate their funds.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-02-04 02:54:52", "id": "lbs1h2"}
{"text": "I found an options strategy that caught my eye, and while I've been doing this for a few years now, Idk why I haven't thought of something like this but anyway my goal here is to find any undiscovered flaws. Maybe my crayons have just kicked in idk but it sounds solid to me anyway. so this is the plan: 1) Monitor Blue chip stonks that slowly rise on the steady (like PG, JNJ, JPM, MMM, HD, GS, etc.). Wait for dip. 2) Buy calls 5% otm that expire two-three months out (unless delta is < .2 or .3 or theta/prem is crazy) (i also have been monitoring technicals to make sure I buy at the right time.) 3) close position with one month remaining to exp. if you're happy with 10 Ds. The idea is, you pay a few hundo for a juicy 'tract on a juicy stock, let that MF premium get rock hard jacked and dip when you've made 50-100% depending on how steady it rose.

{"text": "I assure you, this ISN'T going to get political. Because by all accounts South Africa is screwed. My planned position is bottom paragraph. Under the current ANC government there has been a general degeneration of all aspects of South Africa. Due to systemic nepotism, there are math teachers that don't know what square roots are, army officers that can't read, and cops that have never fired a gun. The practice of fictitious employees that take checks but don't work there is widespread enough that the government has drove itself into insolvency already. Estimates are that some 80% of government funds are misused in some way, ranging from government subsidies given to businesses owned by government officials to simply going missing from accounts. The ANC solved this, against advise of wiser people, with quantitative easing. Which is a fancy term for printing money, and since they could never possibly reverse that printer they're inflating the South African Rand which is why they've had two bouts of inflation near 9% twice in the past 20 years. That is all besides how the largely defunct government doesn't prevent anything on the ground. Roaming bands of pirates (many affiliates of the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighter party) will poison guard dogs and torture and murder residents often for as little as car keys and groceries. Many communities are functionally independent and take the law in their own hands, and in many areas utilities are defunct (untreated sewage goes in the river, untreated tap water comes out and it smells as disgusting as it sounds). South Africans are more likely to have their asylum applications accepted than any other nation as there are so many tales of rape and murder and threats of ethnic cleansing. This equates to the most educated citizens leaving SA and most SA based businesses diversifying out of the country as literacy rates have been falling. These disillusioned departures are not new, as they include the most famous Afrikaner in history Elon Musk who is now a naturalized American. Edit: The Economic Freedom Fighter's usual acronym isn't used because it's also the ticker for a penny stock. I first thought about shorting South Africa over a year ago when I was researching the country (I'm a historian, I read much on the country for fun). I found the only index tracking SA (EZA. Which is why it's a volatile ETF that overall trades sideways. Buying puts on it wouldn't really capitalize on SA going full Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe having experienced the general breakup of modern institutions and hyperinflation due to similar problems. My new broker, IBKR, allows negative currency positions as long you post 10% as collateral. Now my native currency are US dollars, where inflation in 2020 was 1.4% while the South African Rand's inflation stays north of 4% with inflation spikes inevitable over the next decade. This position also reduces my market beta, much needed for me as I've got hugely leveraged positions on American ETFs.

{"text": "I did a post a while back talking about how I trade and that I use option flow data as a trading tool for both stocks and options. Ever since then I have been getting random chat requests asking me what service they should buy so I decided to make this post to help new traders find the best flow for them. Warning: This may be boring and I have tested out all of these options during the month of January. First, what is option flow and why do people use it. Options flow data is a tool that helps you understand how hedge funds and institutional investors feel about certain stocks and ETF's. I use it daily to help me decide what positions I want to open or at least what I should be adding to my short, medium, and long term watch lists. There are two big names on the website side and two names on the app side that are worth using in my opinion. If anyone has any other sources please feel free to comment them down below. One I haven't used before is Blackbox. Ranking if you do not want to read the full review. 1. FlowAlgo[ 2. TitanFlow[ 3. Cheddar Flow[ 4. OptionsFlow[ (Website is broken I think) Apps TitanFlow Cost Per Month: Free Plan is 0$, Basic Plan is $30, Premium Plan is $50 TitanFlow is probably the best option for mobile traders who use apps like Webull, Robinhood, TastyWorks, etc... TitanFlow is a new app that recently launched in December if I remember right. I signed up for the premium plan and overall I would give it an 8/10. The app is broken up into 4 parts. Snapshot Page: This is a macro-level view of what stocks have the most premium being traded throughout the day. I didn't really use this page much mostly because I am a swing trader but if you like to trade options that expire within seven days this may be useful to you. You also can access the basic historical search feature through this page. Flow Page: This is where I spent most of the time on the app. This is where you can see thousands of pieces of unfiltered flow being sent directly to your app. You can search for flow on specific stocks or ETF's and filter them based on your needs. You have fifteen filters you can use which was more than enough for me to find some decent plays using this app. You can also sort the flow by the cost, expiration date, time of the trade, and strike price. You can also access the premium historical search feature from this page. Today's Contract Page: Not sure why they named it this way but from what understand this page will give you flow alerts based on velocity. I have seen some alerts make people 400% in one day but I have also seen some that have dropped over 50% for more volatile stocks. If anything I just use it to find potential day trade opportunities. You can also filter these alerts so that you only see certain types of flow. Flow Alerts Page: You won't spend much time on this page but it can be extremely useful for finding bullish flow for specific stocks and ETF's. You can be pretty precise on what type of flow you want to be alerted to. For example in general I like to be alerted when a piece of flow has a minimum premium of one million, is a call, was traded at the asking price, is out of the money, is unusual, and expires within fourteen days. You can set as many alerts as you want but be careful or your phone will start beeping nonstop. Downsides: The downside is that it's an app, it does not have all the tools that a website like FlowAlgo might have. Flow crashed the app once. To be fair it only happened once but last weekend during that weird crash I think the servers couldn't handle all the flow being traded. I believe it caused CheddarFlow and OptionsFlow to have issues as well. The last real downside I see here which isn't all bad is that the app has major updates every few weeks and when that happens it may take a day or two to understand the new feature they added. OptionsFlow Cost Per Month: Free Plan is $0(Has Ads), Basic Plan is $20 This app really bad but it's the only other app on the market that I could find besides TitanFlow so I feel like I should review it just in case it gets better in the future. For now, I would stay far away. I would give it a 1/10 because of its many bugs and the fact that it has ads. OptionsFlow has been around since November and has been changing a lot which has been both good and bad I feel like they are trying to copy TitanFlow because they recently made their own snapshot page. I paid $20 for their basic plan. Their app is also broken into four parts. Snapshot Page: This page gives you a macro-level view of what's going on in the market. a big problem here is I paid for the premium service but I am still having ads blasted in my face. Besides the ads, it looks clean and organized which is a plus. Today Option Flow Page: This page streams flow through the day but for some reason, it appears to have less flow than every other provider that I have reviewed. Now you may love or hate this but I ended up hating the fact that they only show you flow that was traded at the ask. (You can only see what is being bought and not sold) I like having access to all the data and then filtering it to match my needs. OptionsFlow has eight filters you can use which is less than the other apps and websites but it\u2019s better than nothing. The last thing about this age is during after-hours the flow page goes blank and says \"there is no options flow today\" which can be confusing if are new to option flow data. Historical Option Flow Page: Not sure what they are trying to do here but the historical page is EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE FLOW PAGE. The only difference is the name of the page so this page doesn't need another review. Dark Pool Prints Page: I did not have any real problems on this page which brought a smile to my face. I checked out the dark pool prints and tried to trade using the data but didn't really have much success. Some people may have better luck than me in using the data though. Downsides: There is a lot of downsides right now so I would stay far away from this for now. When I pay for a product I want the product to be in working order and do not want to be forced to watch ads when the basic plan is supposed to get rid of them. Websites FlowAlgo Cost Per Month: $150 I enjoyed using FlowAlgo and if you trade with over 10k and trade from home this will probably be your favorite place to get option flow data. The way the websites are laid out is much different than how the apps are laid out which has its ups and downs. The platform is algorithmically built to monitor all the essential details that you require to track sweep orders. FlowAlgo reveals these orders and executes them as soon as possible. In the dashboard panel, you can filter these orders. The dashboard panel looks intuitive, presenting the overall sentiment and the trading volume. One of the best features is that FlowAlgo lets you spot dark pools. You can filter and sort to your heart's content which can be very helpful when you're looking for potential play. It also has a chat feature where you trade ideas with other traders. I would give it a 9/10. FlowAlgo has the most features of any option flow product on the market. Downsides: This service is very expensive and might be out of reach of most new retail investors. Another downside I have found is that it can feel overwhelming and can take a few weeks to get the hang of. CheddarFlow Cost Per Month: Standard Plan $85, Professional Plan $99 If you cannot afford FlowAlgo this may be your next best bet if you want to use a website. CheddarFlow definitely feels like a watered-down FlowAlgo but still valuable. The layout is simple which I liked and the quality of flow was pretty close to FlowAlgo. Cheddar Flow\u2019s main objective is to make options money flow more accessible and easier to understand for everyone, especially for newbie traders. I did find their service much easier to understand than FlowAlgo but that is also because there were fewer features to learn how to use. Overall I would give this website a 7/10. I think if they can match FlowAlgo's features but stay at their current price this may one day be my top pic. Downsides: Expensive for what you are getting. I feel like they need more features to justify their high price point. Their customer service can be hard to get in touch with and I have heard they can charge you before your free trial is up which can be very annoying if you trying to unsubscribe a day before your trial ends. I Have Spoken. You may agree or disagree with my reviews but please share your experiences so all of these new option traders can start the process of learning to use option flow data.

Stocks and real estate are where you want to be when inflation hits. The real returns of the 80s were 7-8% excluding dividends, which is quite average. The thing is there are plenty of deflationary forces around the economy: rent controlled apartments, food subsidies, etc. So inflation served you well, if this is how you were invested.

First off, I'm not advocating to hold for the squeeze as at this point, who know if it will ever be squoze. Until the report comes out next week, its guess work at this point and will only be an educated guess as they'll be old figures when they are released. I'm holding and I'll be buying more (averaging down) for a longer term investment. GME 15 @ $240 AMC 40 @ $13 So, what do we know is true? There's a report coming that will release figures of shorts potentially covered next week. Everyone's reporting \"Game over for GME\". Why would that be reported if it were over? GME have hired Amazon Execs to up its E commerce. The people have backed GME and AMC. This is massive, you can buy reputational advertising for the billions the hedge funds lost and people will want a piece of the action once this is over. It only increases how viable it is for investment long term. There memes for this whole escapade were worth the giant red figure thats keeping eye contact with while it takes a massive wank all over my profits. So please don't be defeatist. It's demoralising seeing a big red in the account but everyone can come back from this. Grab your bootstraps and average down as much as you can and maybe it will pop, if not, it's looking more and more a viable investment after all this exposure, so average down keep! And keep investing over the next year and earn those long term tendies!! Hold, buy more on the dips and see what happens! God speed you beautiful apes.

{"text": "The punchline: Citadel and Point72 own shit tons of AMC, BB, and NOK, and presumably want them to increase. \u200b I've found it somewhat suspicious that most accounts saying to buy/hold AMC, NOK, and to a degree BB are new. In addition, when each of these stocks started getting promoted here, other than GME (which was pretty much all that was talked about at the time) we were still almost exclusively an options subreddit. It took forever for most of us retards to learn that shares were important for GME as a special case, but all of the support for AMC, NOK, and to a degree BB was/is about holding shares, which was grounds to get booted to r/investing prior to GME. We're wallstreetbets after all. We trade high-risk options and share in our love of excruciatingly erotic loss porn. The people promoting AMC, NOK, and BB didn't/don't seem to fit in with their recommendations of shares. So I decided to look into this more. \u200b After being reminded by Cramer's video that hedge funds will often manipulate sentiment premarket by pushing the stock up and then slowly dumping it, I decided to look into a premarket comparison of GME and AMC on a random recent day. As you can see below, GME and AMC are both pumped up premarket, but by open GME has been shorted down (and it pops up) whereas AMC is in the stratosphere and falls sharply once everyone in the market is trading freely: \u200b This seems like they may be trying to manipulate GME and AMC in opposite ways. This premarket activity can make people pile into non-GME stocks if it looks like GME peaked and others haven't. I haven't looked at BB or NOK, but my guess is that we'd see a similar divergence between GME and those stocks in after hours/premarket as well. \u200b Most importantly, Citadel and Point72 are long on BB, AMC, and NOK. # BB According to 13F filings, Citadel owns 292,926 shares of, call options on, and put options on AMC, and Point72 owns 21,758 shares. It's not possible to know what options strategy (e.g., long straddle) Citadel has in play, but it's clear Point72 and Citadel have both benefited from AMC's enormous increase. # NOK According to 13F filings Citadel has in play, but it's clear Citadel has benefited from NOK's rise. \u200b We already learned this morning that Citadel owns a humongous stake in silver, so that is most likely being shilled too. Importantly, if any of these funds sell off AMC, BB, NOK, or silver during their increase, they all have more capital to short GME with. The only stock increase that really hurts either of these funds or Melvin is GME. These funds shorted a viable and successful company to 140%. I know I would prefer to specifically focus on hedge funds that seem to have knowingly engaged in illegal naked shorting (Melvin, probably), appear to have forced Robinhood to stop allowing purchase orders (Citadel, Robinhood's primary financer), or are literally run by people who have been convicted of securities fraud (Point72). \u200b # Why did AMC, BB, or NOK get restricted too, then? The question remains as to why all of these stocks were restricted by many brokers at around the same time as GME. My belief is that purchases on these stocks were restricted in order to make them look like they were stocks that these hedge funds didn't want us to buy. Alternatively, some hedge funds are short these other stocks, so it's possible that they were having liquidity issues that also affected the market. But, like I mentioned above, I'd prefer to focus on hurting hedge funds engaging in illegal activities. \u200b TLDR: hedge funds profit off of your buying AMC, BB, and NOK calls/shares. These stocks seem to be shilled on here as alternatives to GME to distract us. Unless you want to line the pockets of Citadel, Point72, and indirectly Melvin, stay away from AMC, BB, and NOK.

Small Melvin will not be able to put up this huge amount of cash, not even if the lender liquidates all their assets. What happens in that case? What happens if the price increases further and further and shorts aren't able to close their position? At some point, somewhere, some rules are going to get broken, right? Because this is a situation that should not happen and somehow can not happen. So what is going to happen to retail? Will the lender make some kind of deal with Melvin? Usually if you can't pay your debt, you will default into bankruptcy. And what is going to happen when shorts go bankrupt? Who is going to buy back the shorted positions? I assume it's no one, rules will be broken and the small retail trader without any lobby will pay the mess. To be honest, I don't have much knowledge about the finance industry, so this was going around my head - maybe someone with greater knowledge could tell me what is going to happen next? Please don't get me wrong and downvote me - I am trying to understand the chances and risks of this play and also the greater picture. Because usually the big capital wins and not the retail pleb. As you can already see, rules are changed mid game because it simply \"can't\" happen that the big ones fail and retail wins. It is not intended to work like this, the system.

Not only did the GameStop coalition make some of you brilliant people pay off their student loans, put down payments on houses, and make multiple charitable donations to great causes, but it caused the world to see the flaws in the 'system' and 'the free market'. I'm in my late twenties and I've seen the best this country can't be. My dad is a salesman. Growing up as a kid in the 90s, he supported me and my three siblings our whole lives. Before the the 2000s, bonuses were spread throughout the company he worked for at the time. If the company did well, if the sales people did a good job for the company they work for, everyone was given a fair bonus in accordance with the profits brought in. This way of comradery (fairness) doesn't seem to exist anymore. We see it as a fantasy that both the CEO and subordinates, that earn the company the real profits, can both profit together. Everyone involved in the day-to-day labor worked their tails off for the betterment of the company they put the hours in for. All for the wellbeing for them and their families. Both the higher ups and 'underlings' worked in sync with one another for the most part, that being the chairmen of the company and the salespeople/installers that are involved in selling/implementing the product and all prospered from the work being done.

{"text": "$PDD, or PinDuoDuo, is the stock that I like more than any other stock on the market based on fundamentals and macroeconomics. I will try to keep this short for fellow retards and I will also share why I could be wrong to keep things fair and balanced. Keep in mind, since Wall Street thinks we are all dumbasses, this stock is likely to go down after I write this post. If it does, I will most certainly be loading up on more stock and a lot more options. Edit: two months ago, I wrote about a PT for PDD of $180 that the mods removed, but the stock skyrocketed right after earnings. I was right then. I'm right again. # What is PinDuoDuo PinDuoDuo is an ecommerce company in China founded in 2015 by a former Google software engineer. The company is pioneering the concept of social ecommerce, an idea that product discovery is best facilitated as recommendations from people in your network. Most product discovery on the web today is driven by searches on the web, so this a novel business model.\\ Th company also pioneered a group buying function whereby customers that can get more people to buy with them can get further discounted prices for goods. Until somebody whined about it, PinDuoDuo was the best place in the world to buy a Tesla. \ud83d\ude02\\\\ By the numbers: Market Cap Today: 221 BillionMarket Cap August 2018: 19 BillionRevenue Growth Reported Last Quarter: 89% YoYMost Recent Report of Active Buyers: 737 MillionAlibaba Daily Active Buyers: 757 Million Active UsersRevenue: RMB 14.2 BillionFirst Ever Profitable Quarter: Last Quarter (FY2021Q3)Internet Penetration in Rural China: Grew 13% from March 2020 to June 2020. It's over 50% and growing, there by growing the PDD SAM, or serviceable addressable market. Some might argue that they have grown too fast, but let's take a look at few key factors. \u200b 1.There is a major holiday around the corner, February 11-17. $PDD has played a key role in practically every single holiday in China. Single's Day was even a huge success for the group buying platform because singles grouped together to give each other gifts for being single. I know for a fact that we can emphasize with those users as a community. This year, I will be buying valentine's day gifts for my wife's boyfriend, and all my friends in similar circumstances will do the same. On a serious note, the Chinese New Year has begun. It has historically been the largest periodic people migration on the planet. Due to Covid fears and other factors, many families will not get together this year if they live in different cities. For China, that usually means there will be a fuck ton of food purchased to fill plates that don't have eaters hovering over them. That's the tradition. There will also probably be some gift buying happening for citizens that cannot travel as expression of concern. PinDuoDuo's recent move into agriculture will likely spell historic gains for the business in terms of revenue growth, but also in terms of user acquisition. 2. PinDuoDuo international growth is quietly accelerating. They don't talk about much and I don't totally understand why. Lots of companies are working with them with the other leaders in the market. Keep in mind that their 5 year is not available because they haven't even been public that long. The three year figure for them is a monstrous 290%. If their product catches on in other markets in Asia and parts of the west, we could see that number skyrocket. I hope for them to buy successful brands in other markets, swap the technology for their own, and further improve their recommendation engine's moat with the troves of data they have for operating these systems. If they can penetrate, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and Oceania, damn son. My PT is too low. If not, I expect the Chinese market to drive enough growth that this figure is a reasonable price target on a \\~45x multiple. Shopify gets this multiple and isn't even as cool. I expect them to partner with mobile device manufacturers and brands to bring a more integrated experience to market over the next few years. The tier 1 city growth also paints a bright future for the prospects of the stock. \u200b My Bearish Price Target: $235 The Chinese market is red hot and due for a cool down. While I think that such a turn is unlikely in the short term, there are some challenges that operating in Chinese pose for fast growing businesses. Some unknowns for me include the regulatory landscape on personal information and how much data can be used to power personalized experiences for your users. My limited research has suggested that this is not a problem in China like it is in the EU or the Americas, but the right to be forgotten is growing traction globally. There may be some movement in China for reform, though it seems unlikely, that challenges the ability for PinDuoDuo to generate such high quality recommendations. I cannot see the company growing substantially over the next six months for any reason short of a war or political unrest. During the brief period of unrest in the US, the stock market climbed. In closing, if they continue to grow in the tier 1 cities, their reputation for fake/counterfeit products means that they will likely falter at key growth opportunities. Since stocks go up, they gain 30-40 $'s a share on a bad year by my estimation. Positions: \\~$100 C Jan 22 \u200b \\~$250 C Jan 22 If I hit my bullish price target, I will probably only exercise the options and hold for an Amazon ten years because that is very fast growth. I would likely want to take profits on the $250 to wait for a pullback to buy even more options because my bullish target is right for the next two years or so. If we hit the bearish target over the next few months, and only barely get in the money by the time we get into the expiration date, I will likely exercise all options because what a steal. I know the stock will be at $375 in no time. Embarrassingly, I dropped a lot of shares to join the mega-fucking-obvious GME/AMC short squeezes. Holding those stocks until capital gains at this point. I still have $270 and $100 call options for next year purchased quite a while ago. I will be entering more options plays for the June earnings over the course of the next several weeks. I will be happy to post those positions here as I acquire them. I am not a technical investor. I invest on macroeconomic trends that impact companies and I am doing quite well. I am also not a financial advisor and do not know shit, but I am very hopeful about the growth prospects of this company. I like this stock.

{"text": "Second time posting....hopefully the mods approve: Hey fellow retards, I just wanted flag this great post by u/MarioBuzo, the DTCC and its clearing agents while the regulatory bodies remain indifferent (complicit?). As always, assume what you will. Synopsis post below. 1. First, the shorts work with the banks to create fraudulent shares to drive the price down. This was most likely the cause of Thursday\u2019s dip in GME\u2019s shares. The HFs and the bank literally trade the same shares back and forth with each other to drive the price down in larger volumes than the buy orders and then never deliver the shares because they never own them in the first place. This technique is known as \u201cstrategic fails-to-deliver\u201d and is basically given a pass by the SEC. 2. Next, the shorts work with the usual media suspects and research analysts to push their lies. 3. Third, the DTCC, which is the central repository for all shares and owned by the brokerages, allows the creation of billions of counterfeit shares through a process called Continuous Net Settlement (CNS) that never even make it to the SEC. This is where everything gets very murky. Naturally, the DTCC has resisted every effort at transparency. 4. Fourth, brokerages pull margin from customers causing a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Anyone seen that recently?) The short's playbook today is the same as its always been. Only it never accounted for a WSB rebellion. I highly suggest reading the articles because I\u2019m only skimming the surface of how complicated and rigged the entire system is. Not surprisingly the root cause is the sheer amount of money involved for all the players.

And because sometimes, despite (or because of?) the collective stupidity, I learn a lot. Like: How to lose money \ud83e\udd11 \ud83d\ude2d. Quickly. Seriously. Learning how to lose money is so hard. I mean, I only invested about 3500 total. But still, thanks to you guys, managed to lose at least 1500! But seriously, thanks! Because for a measly 1500 greenbacks, as someone who has never, ever invested I learned: - how to use a trading platform - how to read critically - how to place limit orders and not market orders - how basic options works - how to navigate insane amounts of hype, stupidity, and propaganda (the SLVR, BB, NOK pushers, which were always obvious targeted distractions - how little power I have - how even less knowledge I have. So here are a few lessons (which I'm still learning) which I\u2019d like to share with y'all. 1. Be critical of everything - There are not only a lot of shills and bots out there (I\u2019m looking at you, $SLVR-pushers!) but there are, surprise surprise even more autists. Especially with 6 million new accounts of presumably people who have never invested in their live, but in classic Internet-style, already tout themselves as steel-balled market gurus. From people posting data that\u2019s ( fundamentally misinterpreted, or coming to conclusions without enough data or just plain old confirmation bias (basically, all of WSB). Special shoutout to ( very ( which helped me look critically at stuff that has been flying around the forum these last days. 2. Don\u2019t underestimate my ignorance - I know nothing. Literally nothing. I can do basic addition and subtraction, and know stocks go up and down. Personally, the market seems like a huge insane bubble ready to burst at any second. But maybe not. What do I know? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I\u2019m as autistic as you. \ud83e\udd24 3. Get in before the hype - Even to my stupid, ignorant self, I realized buying GME at an all-time high of 150X its low, was a stupid idea. Especially when the entire Internet and even non-Internet media was buzzing with the hype. 3B. (Corollary). - If you are going to go up against a Hedge fund with is 10000X more powerful than you, don\u2019t announce all your moves up front. 4. Understand what the statistics and metrics mean before betting (I mean: \"investing\") - People are posting volume data, short interest numbers, using fancy lingo and stats that I still can\u2019t wrap my brain around (I still haven\u2019t understood how you can sell a put you don\u2019t have for example, that\u2019s how ignorant I am). But, as the wise men & women say - ignorance is an opportunity to redeem yourself. 5. Don\u2019t underestimate all the other players - Hedge funds, Retirement funds. Whales. They all have different agendas. And their agendas are not yours. The worst mistakes I saw were not acknowledging the special advantages that institutional investors will always have. This is not cheating. This is how the market works. You can be a crybaby autist about it, but that\u2019s how it is (I wrote a bit about some of the advantages even I saw that HF have here. Institutional Investors have sentiment trackers, high-speed algorithms, inside information, battle-hardened experience, tricky tactics, etc. You are not going to beat any Hedge Fund of Institutional Investor at a game they invented, made the rules in, and excel at. 6. Expertise is valuable - There is a very good reason why finance jobs, especially at Investment Banks, Hedge Funds and Private Equity firms are the best-paid jobs in the world - because they places hire very fucking smart people, who work very fucking hard (7 days a week, 14-hour days), to be better at this than you or I. The expectation that we be as good as them, is like expecting to pop out of your mom\u2019s womb and run a 100m faster than Usain Bolt without a day\u2019s training. The reason we don\u2019t like Hedge Funds or the stock market in general, is it is because it a casino for the wealthy. We are the poor schlubs sitting at the 1 dollar blackjack table, while watching the billionaires in their Tuxedos coming out of their Bentley\u2019s to play at the million dollar poker tables. From a recent Economist article this week: \u201cEven in America stock market gains have mainly accrued to the rich. The wealthiest 1% owns 56% of the stock market, up from 46% in 1990; the top 10% owns 88% of the market.\u201d 7. The HF didn\u2019t cheat. They don't need to. They hustled - They invited ignorant newbies to sit at their tables (yes, that\u2019s us), and then fleeced us of our cash. We are idiots, because we KNEW the hustle was coming and we KNEW the pros were pros, and yet we STILL played against them. Little reminders for myself for next time: 1. Accept the risk - Any money I gamble in this friggin casino I can count as lost. 2. If you have no clue, don\u2019t bet - I have no clue what a \u201cCalendar Call\u201d or a \u201cVertical Call\u201d is. You can bet I won\u2019t be making that, until I do. 3. Losing (preferably a little bit) of money, is a very strong motivation to learn. And a li\u2019 tip for my fellow autists: Don\u2019t post fucking DDs if you are an ignorant shit. Positions - Holding 215 AMC (115 bought (stupidly, and during the hype) @14; 100 bought during a dip @ 8.11) Holding 2 GME (1 free from RH, 1 bought at 115) 1 SPY put 332; EXP 03/31 Final final note (for real, this time): If you think the stock market is unfair, you are right. Unfair is the very core foundation of capitalism. If you really really are pissed off at capitalism and hedge funds, have the balls to be socialist or a marxist; refuse to participate in the free market; and refuse to consume.

{"text": "LONDON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Hedge funds with bearish positions on GameStop, the video game retailer at the centre of the recent retail trading frenzy, made $3.6 billion in profits this week as the share price dropped sharply, financial analytics firm Ortex said on Friday. That comes after short positions on GameStop suffered cumulative losses of $12.5 billion over January as a horde of small-time investors piled into the stock, inflating its price as much as 2,400% and forcing many hedge funds to buy them back to cover losses. But the short squeeze has since ebbed, pushing GameStop shares 90% below last week's peak of $483. Ortex data also showed hedge funds' profits from shorting AMC , another company targeted by retail investors, amounted to $430 million this week as of Thursday close. In Europe, short sellers of Nokia stock made $126 million, the data showed.

{"text": "This stock will fly again due to hype, but it's a $0 company. My current thesis is they never actually mass produce a car. Firstly, their projections are to start production in Q4 2022. Think about that for a minute. It'll be late Q1 2023 before they plan to ship a car. And that's IF everything goes to plan. By then, GM, VW, Tesla, Ford, Volvo, Honda, Toyota, Lucid, and others will have a two year head start on actually delivering EVs. By then there's no reason for someone to wait 24 months for a car. People did it for Tesla's because they were the only game in town, but they won't do it for a Fisker. Second, the CEO is a huge liability. He already made decisions that ran the exact same type of company into the ground. This does not bode well for long term success. Yes, it could be a one off due to failed battery packs, but who approved their use? Oh, and they just announced a partnership with Foxconn to build their next car after the Ocean. And where? At the (in)famous Wisconsin factory. You remember the one? [ . This does not show me that he's improved his decision making. Third, price. If they can deliver on what they are promising I will be amazed. A 300 mile range EV with a solar roof, and full vegan interior for $37,000. I may be wrong, but I just don't see it. They have no proprietary tech, so will be getting all the internals from other manufacturers, but can somehow undercut their prices? That's a leap of faith. Faith that hasn't been earned. Fourth, volume. They will need to stand up an entire after sales support network (repair shops, trained repair techs, replacement parts, distribution, etc.) for a brand new car line. In every country they plan to sell to. You need huge volume to justify this. Even Tesla is having problems getting people timely repairs to their cars. How long will that solar roof last after the first hail storm? Or the first drive behind a dump truck with unsecured gravel in the back? Who's going to repair it? How much will it cost? How long will it take to get the parts? Fifth, design. A small concern, I know but I am thinking that by the time they ship a car their design will be outdated. I think the car looks great now, but so does everyone else's. And design tastes will change in the next two years. Can they afford a design refresh before they even ship a car? Finally, they have no real differentiator. There's no reason to buy a Fisker over any other EV that will be out ahead of them. I see canceled pre-orders, manufacturing troubles, regulatory hurdles, and ultimately a failed endeavor without anything to show for it.

{"text": "Ok look apes, I have been following the GME trends since before the first squeeze. Needless to say, much like the rest of you, I have spent hours upon hours looking at the trends, shorts, and data since the day of reckoning last month. And with the jump last week there has been a lot of paper hand BS/ Misinformation being spread (especially with RKT) EDIT: As someone rightfully pointed to RKT is not bad, just the bots and the public narrative is a bit suspect IMO To simply put it, in my opinion, we are on the verge of something big... TL:DR at the bottom for the most atuist Here is why my fellow tards, 1. We have proven the community strength, A LOT I MEAN A LOT of us have held and held until we were finally seeing some green for the first time in weeks. I mean serious green, despite the quote on quote \"Lackluster day\" we are still up 162.5% the past WEEK! 2. A stock with relatively little discussion on this page (IN COMPARISON TO GME) (RKT) is suddenly piking 50,60,70% increase??? Not to knock any fellow apes who invested (hopefully we will see a dump in GME soon after) but it is so suspicious that a large movement into RKT aligns with the GME rise. Don't take my word on this, but we have seen in the past other \"GAMMA SQUEEZE\" for fill in the blank as soon as GME has spiked, and what happens after? They fall and fall hard. 3. The HF are scared, bad. With news breaking about Melvin and Citadale breaking over the past week, we know that they have lost billions. Not only that , they have continued to short the stock with heavy volume. Now with naked shorting, no one knows what the present of the float is exactly, but the estimate remains high. SOURCE: Wall Street Journal, 5 days ago. Now why you might ask losing roughly 50% of your entire capital important? If you are an autist, and I know you are, let me explain. I mentioned this in my last post, but essential without capital, how can HF run effective short latter attacks as we saw after the enormous initial spike? They can't- or at least we hope- with what we have seen over the past few days, GME has not seen any significant short latter attacks, heck we have gone up $20 alone this week!!! (EVEN WITH THE MARKET SHITTING ITS PANTS) 4) With contracts being exercised last week at around $55 dollars, we saw a gamma squeeze occur. Now I have seen 5+ people on here explain wildly differing theories ranging from, if we hit 130 it will trigger the next squeeze, or on 3/15 the squeeze will happen! Now we can all take this with a grain of salt, after all, we are apes. But what we can do is hold and continue to break resistance, yesterday was $113, today it was $120. In my opinion, if we continue to rise steadily we can trigger another ITM call and see another squeeze. F ROBINHOOD I know that to your paper hands this will kill you, but if the squeeze never happens GME is a great long-term hold. Here is why: \\-They have landed a huge multi-year deal with micro soft. \\-They fired their insanely incompetent CFO Jim Bell, seriously look him up dude was a douche. this shows seriously promising financial redevelopment for GME. \u200b STILL F ROBINHOOD, we have been stable and we are holding.

{"text": "\\ I'm pretty sure the majority of people who post \"can't wait to see the look on my accountants face when I drop 100 pages of transactions\" are just saying it as a joke. But for the noobs who actually think you need an accountant to do your taxes now that you're a big time trader... It takes 10 minutes to do yourself. Use TurboTax Premier. Your broker will give you a 1099 consolidated statement, which has the 1099-B. You just input the Total of all transactions. Do not input each individual transaction unless you're trying to kill time because your wife locked in you the cuck closet while she gets railed by her boyfriend. The 1099-B will also have Wash Sales totals and you just enter that and code \"W\". Always input as positive numbers into Turbotax, even things that intuitively might feel like negatives. A common recommendation is that TurboTax will let you sync with your brokerage so just do an auto-upload of all transactions. Sure, go ahead and do auto-upload for 1099-DIV for those times you went all Boomer on us and held T, IBM, and KO; but I wouldn't do that for 1099-B. The reason is some of us print and review our taxes before filing since we have stuff like mortgage interest, charity, and other deductions. You might be doing that yourself for your van down by the river and your donations to King Kong. And if you auto-uploaded all your transactions when you print, you're going to have 50 pages of Form 8949 (Cap Gains). Here's where to find the totals by brokerages I have used: IBKR (Interactive Brokers) -summary 1099-B table on page 2, literally takes up just 1/4 of the page. This is my true degenerate account - and I have 40 pages of transactions behind it. Schwab - ok, Schwab sucks. It doesn't have a summary 1099-B table so you have to search through the doc, and they seem to list the same totals in a couple sections making it more confusing. So that might add 2 minutes. Plus, just their layout sucks, so it's a much bigger document. I probably have 10x the number of transactions in IBKR (degenerate account) vs Schwab (investment and theta gang account) yet IBKR was 40pages while Schwab was 100+ pages. For me, I finally it on page 96 of 112. Vanguard - Summary table page 1. Robinhood - just kidding; I'm not 15 years old, so I use real brokerages.

{"text": "Okay retards, time to talk economics and hyper-inflation grow some wrinkles. Wanna know why the market has been red lately? J-Pow is saying fuck your Calls. \" Asked about the risks that inflation and overheating pose to the larger economy, Powell doubled down on previous statements and reiterated that the Fed does not plan to adjust its policy until it sees significant evidence of maximum employment in the labor market, among other conditions. \"It\u2019ll take some time to get there,\u201d he said, noting that inflation is also running well below the Fed\u2019s 2% target\" Section 1: \"HyPeR-iNfLaTiOn Is CoMiNg!\" Let's go back to some basics. Thanks to our current banking system, we live in a debt-based society where our goal is to pull out a loan for 5% interest and make 420.69% gains. Now everyone wants to be a chad with an infinite money glitch trying to compete for the same slices of pie, so now we have a problem. For example, I have 100 tendies and you have 100 bananas and we decide a 1:1 tendie to banana rate is nice and life is good. All of a sudden, fucking Chad McDonkeyKong says he has 200 bananas and he wants to trade with me. So now we have 300 bananas in circulation and only 100 tendies. I now agree that the exchange rate is 1:3 tendies to bananas and now you're down 66% on your banana trade. Fucking Chad... That's inflation for you. More money is added into circulation, and therefore you need more of it to buy the same goods. Now let's say your girlfriend gets pissed at Chad McDickFace for putting too many bananas in the banana market (why would she? LOL), so he pulls out 100 bananas. Now with 200 bananas in circulation and 100 tendies, the exchange rate is 1:2 tendies to bananas. Guess who just made tendies? Fuck ya you did! Now you're only down 50% from when Chad entered the market. That's deflation for you. Money is removed from circulation and there you need less of it to buy the same goods. Ya, I know that already, retard! Get to the point! If we look at the US's monetary base (blue) and the Fed's balance sheet (red) you can clearly see there's a lot more bananas in circulation. INFLATION!!! \u200b [ to collect information about pricing on goods, services and loans in the economy. It's got some flaws, but it's been reliable enough to account for inflation for the last few hundreds of years, so we'll stick with this as our metric. \ud83d\udcf7 for \"optimal market and economic growth and stability\". I recall hearing 2 - 3% is about the average that most growing societies experienced as well, so it seems like a sweet spot for us humans to operate. So what does it mean? In order to stay ahead of all the new Chads pulling out loans and YOLO'ing you need to increase your net worth by at least this amount per year. Real returns are when you factor in taxes on assets/gains and this tend to lower it. Anyhow, let's see what the data says about inflation and QE: . So how does it work? It's something like this. Primary dealer (bank?) goes to the bond market, looking for some tendies. Normally they would only buy $10 worth of tendies, but Papa JPow is mother fucking huuuungray, so they buy $60 worth of tendies each time they go shopping. This is fine if the bond market had infinitely supply, but it doesn't (the US will only be issue so much debt), so each time the supply gets shrunk a little bit. So over time, we'll start to see a supply shortage (remember, bonds are retarded, so when the price goes up, interest rates and yields go down. Fucking magic). JPow is trying to forcing a MOTHER FUCKING SUPPLY SHORTAGE in bond market. So what's JPow doing with these gay bonds? See, daddy JPow is worried that these little bitch ass banks (JPM, WFC, etc...) are going to go full retard again, like in 2008, so he's shoving all these bonds in safes and locking that shit up until we're back to normal. In exchange for the $50 tendies, he's giving these ass hats $50 cash so they can keep jerking each other off, as long as they don't YOLO it into the markets and economy, life is good. Daddy JPow also knows he can keep doing this QE trick until bond prices go to infinity, but negative interest rates are kind of a pain to deal with... Now, at the same time these smaller banks aren't as retarded as we think they are, and they also don't want to fail like in 2008 and they've learned a thing or two. Sure Papa JPow can throw money at them again, but he already locked up some of their fun money and he was pretty pissed last time. So, the easiest thing to do right now is buy these dumb ass bond for cheap and sell them to daddy JPow for some easy gains. They also know many of us are fucked without jobs, so why even risk lending right now? So banks are buying bonds, JPOW has a safe, and banks aren't lending... Nothing new here... Well, the take away here is that all that money JPow is printing is STUCK in the banks and the banks don't want to lend it out. A good way to show this is the M2 Velocity, which shows how many times money changes hands before money is destroyed. It's like this: Monkey A borrows banana from Chad McShittyAss. Monkey A buys tendies off Monkey B. Monkey B gives banana back to Chad. In this case, the banana went from C -> A -> B -> C. Since Chad created the banana and destroyed the banana, he doesn't count, in the transaction, so it's just A & B that matter. In this case the M2 velocity would be 2.0. Now let's look at how QE affects us: , people are sitting on cash (disinflationary) and smart people are paying down debt (deflationary), where's the inflation coming from? Actually, it's all speculation. . We want it to go down. See those little green marks, those are short positions, they make it go up. Last year saw the LARGEST short position in the bond market. EVER. You know Papa JPow with his infinite money glitch, he wants the red line to go down. Sweet, we have the FUCKING FEDERAL RESERVE on our side! You know who hates shorts more than Elon, Cohen or Our RKT Crew? The FUCKING FED. Since the dollar is tied to treasuries, popping the shorts will also cause the dollar to rally. You know who hates the dollar to rally? Fucking everyone. Stock prices drop, Gold prices drop, Oil prices drop, it's harder to trade internationally... Yep... JPow is a huge fucking bear. Your calls are actually fukt. So how do we profit off JPow? Full gay bear style (when the time is right of course). Macro can be slow as shit to play out, so leaps or shares are the game. Timing is hard for this shit, but JPow is HUUUNGRY for them bondies. The most obvious monies to be had: long $TLT (30y bonds), Cash is fine too! (just follow $UUP for a rally), Inverse $GDX. I dunno, I'm sure you other gay bears have some fetishes out there that will compliment a dollar rally. What to stay away from: Inflation protected Bonds (this is tied to the CPI and you'll lose money if our economy eats shit). Probably companies with large negative cash flow when shit hits the fan. You know, the usual recession shit. Thanks for listening to my TED Talk. TLDR: What the fuck did I just read? So much gear bear shit in here dude... What the actual fuck? a) QE hasn't lead us to hyper inflation, banks still aren't lending and other countries are deflating right now, so deflation is the real enemy. b) JPow is trying to cause a supply shortage in the bond market (bond prices go upsies) c) JPow or the economy are going to pop the shorts on the 30y and cause the markets to melt down. d) When JPow does \"The Twist\", that's when he'll start buying 30y's :) Positions: I'm a fucking broke, but I'll be DCA'ing into TLT shares and calls 6 TLT $200C 1/22 6 shares TLT @ $145 33 shares of VXX @ 15.24 (I know...) 12 shares GME @ 89 15 shares RKT @ 24 RKLB when the start offering shares Other dumb shit I'm bag holding now $17k in cash in my dumb 401k to buy a dip in a mutual fund LOL Steven Van Metre on YouTube: Great to learn about weekly, macro data and how QE works.

Last year around this time wsb was hard on the spy 200p wagon (myself included) we saw circuit breakers multiple days and got drunk on our own bias and it all made so much sense at the time I mean we had variationseperate our profit wcgw. As you know a ton of us got smoked me especially in ulta puts (I'm a retard). This whole gme situation has changed in January it was a different beast now there is such a strong mob mentality that the shorts have to squeeze but realize what has actually happened. Both large run ups were started by large whales purchasing a huge volume of high delta calls. The first was then extended by a social media rally. The main reason this rally died was due to a large volume of call options closing out and locking in profit. When a call is closed the market maker will sell the previously held shares they bought to hedge thier delta, and freeing those up to be borrowed to short. Do I think it will run again? Sure but be warned each time it spikes calls will close and flood the market with shares, also put volume has jumped considerably which market makers purchase shorts to delta hedge these. Long story short wsb just dosnt have the capital currently to move this stock considerably and has been riding among whales as an easy media scapegoat. If you think well the 9 million here only have to own x shares, realize people rarely put thier money where there mouth is and are just watching for entertainment.

This is probably full of mistakes so please help me fix them and tell me why I'm a dumbass if you think I'm a dumbass so I can get better at making tendies. Here's my thinks: $TWO is a REIT that does mortgage backed securities. A few nights ago, I was looking through insider buying data from OpenInsider and I stumbled onto a company called Two Harbors. Their CEO had just purchased \\~$230,000 worth of stock. ( [ ) I was interested in that because I've been looking stocks that had dropped due to covid but hadn't bounced back yet. $TWO is definitely that kind of company. ( [ ) \u200b \u200b They had some insider sales, but there have been none since the rally started in Feb. Only buys. I did a whole bunch of reading about the company, and what I found most useful was a transcript of their quarterly earnings call over at s33 king alpha... which is soft paywalled so I can't post here. TLDR: Since they specialize in residential mortgage they figured they'd get buttrammed by people who couldn't pay their mortgage, but that ended up being not nearly as bad as they expected. As a play to survive market volitility, they sold off risky but profitable investments and stacked fat piles of tendies in a bunker. They lost a bunch of money all at once from getting too anal retentive and fearing the apocalypse, but they ended up not using those tendies for survival, and are now ready to unleash those tendies to turn them into more tendies. Their 2020 Annuals sucked: \u200b But when you drill down to their quarterly, you see that the losses were isolated to one bad quarter, and their quarterly earnings are already back to pre-covid numbers... but their stock price is only about 1/2 of where it was pre-covid... AND THEY'RE SITTING ON A BUNCH OF CASH! \u200b According to Whale Watch ([ 85.71% of hedgies have increased their position in the last quarter. 63.04% is held by institutions: OutValueBlackrock Inc. 26,951,349, 9.85% Vanguard Group, Inc.

So far so good. I think there's room left. \u200b I'm derpy as fuck at technical analysis, but you can see the bottoms going up and the tops going up too. All month the resistance lines have become the new support lines. The current trend line is just a litter steeper than the Feb trend line. And I had somebody read to me from a pirated copy of technical analysis for dummies that this means stonk go up: \u200b Oh, and did I mention the options are dirt cheap?

{"text": "So why have treasuries actually tanked recently? Is the wave of hyper-inflation finally coming? Probably not. The recent drop in treasuries was likely just the result of some boring banking regulation exemptions expiring this month. Back in March 2020 bank deposits and US Treasuries were exempt from what is known as the \"Supplementary Leverage Ratio\". Since this is really hard to explain accurately and briefly, and most of you can't read anyway, the nutshell version is that SLR tells banks they must have a certain amount of \"capital\" relative to various assets on their books (investments, deposits, etc) in order to ensure a bank can withstand a market downturn. Why do you care? Well, the SLR exemption expires this month, which means that both UST and customer deposits will now factor back into this equation. At the same time, the banks are about to take in a shitload of stimulus money as deposits. Also, the FOMC meets tomorrow and will likely be deciding on whether they will extend the SLR. Last time around, a lot of Democrats were very against these SLR exemptions and there is a good chance the SLR rule won't be extended due to political factors regardless of economic/financial factors. Likely, banks having been dumping UST to come into compliance with regulations after this exemption expires. Additionally, whether the Fed will implement some type of yield curve control will likely be decided at this meeting. We'll be hearing about that on 3/17, which means there's likely to be heavy volatility in treasuries this week. If the SLR exemption is extended or the Fed announces some type of ycc, we might see treasuries eaten up at the end of the week. If they announce neither, we might see another dump. I honestly have no idea which way it will go, but the IV on TLT is low enough that I don't see any reason you can't play both sides. P.S., because the mods have decided to put filters in I can post but can't reply to your comments until I whore myself for more comment karma, so I'll try to PM you if you leave a decent question.

The dividends are nothing earth-shattering but okay and were even increased this year. The parent company Fresenius is a stable global player and keeps making nice acquisitions and has good prospects. Why is it interesting? There were two dips last month in best Felix Baumgartner fashion. Dip No. 1: Because of Covid 19, business is a little worse because some treatments can't be done. Oh scare. The first part of the exploders shits themselves and liquidates the entire depot. Stock crashes from 65\u20ac to 56\u20ac. Then people notice that Corona goes around at some point and maybe that wasn't so smart, so the thing flies back up to 62\u20ac. Dip No. 2: The numbers have been released! For Q4 2020, the experts expect 4.49 billion in revenue, but it's actually only 4.40 billion. A whole 4% less in a massive pandemic crisis, what a scandal! The last hard boiled boomer break out in tears now and like in panic the entire depot is liquidated like piss. Two boomers have been hit particularly hard: Doc Olaf and Harald and was relatively unimpressed by all the corrections. Could perhaps be due to the fact that the boomers have already beaten the thing so much that there was nothing left to kick and spit on. Chapeau!

{"text": "$BDRY Breakwave Dry Bulk Shipping ETF, the ETF that most have never heard of that is up 140% YTD. BDRY buys dry bulk freight futures and gives the investor direct access to shipping rates. It doesn\u2019t own stocks, so it is not affected by the wall street\u2019s sentiment or noise. It follows actual rates, so, for someone who believes that rates are going higher, BDRY offers that simple pure exposure. If you believe that dry bulk shipping freight rates are going to increase then this is the only public investment vehicle available to buy. And the beauty of it? -> as an ETF you can always short it if you believe shipping rates are going to fall.! BDRY is listed on NYSE and is the first and only freight futures ETF exclusively focusing on dry bulk shipping. A pure-play exposure to dry bulk shipping, an instrumental part of the global commodity market, uncorrelated to other major assets. BDRY is designed to reflect the daily price movements of the near-dated dry bulk freight futures. It offers investors unlevered exposure to dry bulk freight without the need for a futures account. It provides transparency to investors by listing all its holdings daily. It is designed to reduce the effects of rolling contracts by using a laddered strategy to buy contracts while letting existing positions expire and settle in cash. What\u2019s the Investment Strategy behind? BDRY will hold freight futures with a weighted average of approximately three months to expiration. It intends to progressively increase its position to the next calendar quarter three-month strip while existing positions are maintained and settle in cash. The allocation is 50% Capesize contracts, 40% Panamax contracts and 10% Supramax contracts, rebalancing annually, as needed. In my opinion, BDRY is the best way to capture the dry bulk shipping opportunity. What most people do is to buy shipping stocks. But is this the most efficient way? No, it\u2019s not. Disadvantages of individual shipping stocks, other than liquidity, include company-specific risks, dilution risks as well as corporate governance and management issues. Finally, especially nowadays, it\u2019s the broader equity market risk even though freight rates generally have exhibited low correlation to equity markets. BDRY is a very innovative product in the world of shipping, transforming every investor into a shipowner that rips the benefits of freight rates through a much simpler and efficient structure compared to shipowning.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-03-19 23:18:42", "id": "m8h2ki"}

I initially thought that this play may have been a hedge for an insanely large short position, but the stock volume, combined with the insanely short date on the purchased options says otherwise. I also thought that it could be part of a janky ass multi-legged options strategy, but my program already checks for that, and upon manual inspection of the data, I also couldn\u2019t find anything.

{"text": "What\u2019s happening to NIO and the rest of the big name stock like Apple and Tesla? I\u2019ll tell you: Most have you must have heard of rising interest rates in the U.S and that is the supposed reason to why the market is taking a slight dip. Well it\u2019s not the reason. It\u2019s fake news. Here\u2019s what going on. The market is taking a slight dip because institutional investors are selling their shares of these big growth stocks. Why are they selling? They are selling because of the whole GME fiasco. GME has not been squeezed yet and that is a fact. You will see media like CNBC saying that Melvin capital is done with GME or that there is nothing left to squeeze. That is all false. It\u2019s FAKE NEWS! The reason why they are taking away the spotlight from GME is because they know that the SP will hit at least $60,000 USD. I know that most of you think it sounds far fetched but it\u2019s not. Hear me out: once GME rockets past $60,000 USD a share what will most retail investors do? They will sell. What will most do with their new found wealth? They will look for other stocks like NIO, Tesla, Apple, and etc.... the list goes on. How will they know which one to choose though? Of course most people will go for the lowest stock price and highest return rate. Do you see where I\u2019m going with this? Wall Street is manipulating the market to create a dip. They want retail investors that profit from GME to buy more shares while the market is red. Why would they do that? Same reason you might put your money into those growth stocks in the first place. They want a high return. Once retail investors flood the growths stocks with their GME profits, Wall St will piggy back on us and drive the price even higher than before. This is what\u2019s happening. Don\u2019t listen to shills or fake news media. It\u2019s pure manipulation. Just be ready and buy the dips as much as possible. Individual retail investors are not selling. It\u2019s only the big guys. Look at most of the charts from this past week. Compare NIO to Apple and Apple to Tesla. It\u2019s the same. The list goes on? If the charts are the same that means all investors are thinking the same thing right? No. It was planned. The stimulus checks that the U.S will be providing, where will it all go? Into the market! Once all that plus GME profits go into the market WALL ST will buy back! Hold your shares and buy the dips. This is manipulation at its finest. Once Wall St is done poking it\u2019s fingers everywhere, the market will be more bullish than ever before. This is not financial advice. I eat paint chips for breakfast.

{"text": "This is not a DD. This is not financial advice. This is a borderline tin-foil hat opinion piece, but it is my honest opinion to explain what I am seeing. Im too fuckin lazy to back this by any data, but it's my attempt to raise awareness to what may really be going on. TL;DR: The \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b are scalping retail on this Gee Em Eee squeeze. Its a squeeze trap. HFs (and the rest of the world) have discovered that people want to squeeze them and are willing to take huge bets on options and buy meme stonks at outrageous prices. They know that people feed on hype even at the expense of their live savings, with desire to get rich and stick it to the man. So, knowing this, how can they protect themselves and scalp retail out of millions? Step 1: Buy meme stonks at low cost basis - this causes a huge price uptick and draws attention from retailers, sucking them in on FOMO and greed. - this also allows them to cover a heavy amount of short positions at the price they bought it at if necessary. Not at $100,420.69 Step 2: Buy more meme stonks. Start a new hype craze by the rapid upward price. - they are still buying it for less than retailers because they know retailers will FOMO in. Step 3: Once the IV is through the fuckin roof, sell tons of options. Step 4: Establish a new high short position. They control the peak because they were the whales largely responsible for driving it up. Step 5: Dump a ton of shares and tank the price. We saw this on Wednesday. Once sold down to a sizeable delta, they then close out on short positions established at their peak. We have data showing 900,000 shares become available to short right after the price \"recovery\". Which means someone covered a fuckton of short shares. Step 6: Control price til option expiry. They want the price to go sideways until all of their written options expire OTM. Step 7: Repeat. They are in no short squeeze danger because they own a ton of the float. There is no one driving the price up but themselves and the weak collective of retail hooked in. The real threats to them would be the following: 1) The rest of the world jumping in and actually throwing in enough capital to squeeze them to a margin call 2) Retail selling EVERYTHING before they do. 3) a whale bigger than them wanting to get into this game. They know the first two likely won't happen. They influence the media to help ensure the first one. They count on retail fomo and diamond handing to not worry about the second option. The third option likely hasn't happened because most institutions with billions of capital probably don't want to risk it going to war with other MAJOR HFs. Keep in mind Citadel is backing Melvin and has a retarded amount of capital. Who wants to risky their own ass to support retail and F with those other big players? And also risk SEC investigations. No, those whales are staying away. So. Ask yourself, is diamond handing and FDing options the right play? Or is retail just being dragged through the mud and diamond handing actually their downfall? Some lucky individuals will cash out some profits, but likely at the expense of other retailers. This is what I believe is happening. And my guess to confirm my suspicions is that we see this price continue to go sideways through tomorrow so all the 3/12 expirys can fall OTM. They may repeat the process next week, or dump everything they own right before QW, either way I don't see them leaving themselves wide open to be F'd by retailers.

{"text": "As promised in the discussion thread I would post some updated info on what Friday could bring in terms of ITM options. TL;DR the number of possible contracts ITM could be DOUBLE last weeks expiry. Over 4 million shares could be called on for these exercised options only adding to the ever increasing snowball. Here is what I did: Pulled the option chain data into excel, ran some numbers on open interest and found some crazy info. What is a gamma squeeze: For those who don't know what a gamma squeeze is but have heard it thrown around let me give a brief ELi5. Gamma squeezes revolve around options, I wont go into too much detail here on what those are, but basically you purchase a contract which gives you the option to buy the stock at a set price on a future date regardless of what that stocks current price is. Contracts are typically in lots of 100 shares per. Option contacts are not usually sold by individuals but rather market makers, biggest of whom being option houses out of Chicago. They have a complex price model which values contracts at set prices for said contract based on probability of them becoming ITM (in the money) of course, the higher the stock price for the contract the lower the cost because the odds of that happening is low. These market makers thought GME was garbage and sold way more contracts than they could feasibly handle because what are the odds GME @ $15 goes to $150... Market makers selling these contracts need to buy shares to hedge, which of course will cause that price to rise more and more. Now that GME is @ $130: Today was a great day, GME closed up $8.17 or 6.58% maybe not the crazy gains some hoped for, but on a down market day is pretty incredible. Now a rise in only $8 may not seem like it has much of an impact on gamma squeeze potential but just wait.. # GME Options Exp. 2021-03-05 (This Friday) GME @ $100 (Last Fridays Close, Option Expiry): At this level going into Friday we could expect 22,427 in open interest in ITM GME contracts this week. That sure is a lot of possible stocks that need to be purchased if those contracts are exercised. About 2,242,700 to be exact or about 4.97% of the TOTAL FLOAT. Crazy. GME @ $130: We can expect 35,989 contracts to be ITM if tomorrow closes above $130. A solid 13,562 more contracts than at the $100 level. This equates to 3,598,900 shares or 7.97% of total float. Now we're getting nutty. What about GME @ $150: Closing Friday above this level brings thousands more contracts ITM. In fact, closing above this price means there would be 46,397 contracts ITM. This means that a whopping 4,639,700 shares or 10.27% of total float. MORE THAN DOUBLE @ $100 What does this mean? Well not every contract will be exercised, even ITM. These market makers have also likely been finding shares to hedge for some time now as well. But its entirely impossible to ignore that if every contract were to be exercised, 10% of all the shares in circulation would be needed and if anyone knows anything about supply and demand, it means more contracts will come ITM next week, and then more again the week after and so on. With the steady price rise we've been seeing, it could be these market makers are slowly buying up shares to hedge, COULD is operative and this is entirely speculation. What we do know is that MASSIVE amounts of money have been changing hands over this past week in GME. There's been crazy volume at times, particularly today, the day before contract expiry. Any how, ill put away my tinfoil hat. What we could be witnessing is the beginning of the beginning, the first domino's. Does this information guarantee the stock takes off to the moon and beyond? No not really, but it sure does increase the odds of that happening. We probably cannot even fathom how these market behemoths are willing to protect themselves. We all saw what happened with RH, and whats crazy is its possibly the tip of the iceberg for actions they took, its just the action that we were able to see. Summary: Since last Friday (2021-02-26, last option expiry) the number of contracts possibly ITM has DOUBLED I repeat DOUBLED. If tomorrow closes above $150 and every contract is exercised 10% of total float will be called on. Even if nothing happens tomorrow and we close @ $130 there is still 50% more contracts ITM than last week. All of this continues to build that snowball that's started to get mighty big. \u200b Ill say it again for those in the back DOUBLED. Mic drop. Not financial advice, this is just for fun.

{"text": "Note: this is my first DD so please don't eat me alive. But I would be grateful for any advice and suggestions on improvements. ( Who is $VIAC? ViacomCBS Inc. is a global media and entertainment company. It includes CBS, Showtime Networks, Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, BET, CBS All Access, Pluto TV and Simon & Schuster and some others I've never heard from. Their biggest revenue comes from capable network and paid streaming services. Literally a quarter of this company is dominating the children's media market. Why the selloff? This is because all of a sudden firms like Goldman Sachs and The Wall Street Bank start force selling huge chunks of stocks in block trades before the market opened on Friday. This obviously led to huge volume trading in $VIAC of 211 million, it's normal rates are at about 35 million. Now as this hot fire ball starts tumbling down the the drain it starts busting any kind of stop loss on it's way, further lowering prices. Now this shows that the selling was not driven by a technical or fundamental reason, as seen on some financial front pages. For me this suggests that the company isn't broken - only the stock. Why the hedgies sold? Some fund managers believe the fire sales indicate that a big hedge fund or family office was in trouble. \"Maeve DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, declined to comment. A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. A person reached at Archegos\u2019s New York office on Friday declined to comment. An email sent to Hwang seeking comment wasn\u2019t returned.\" -Someones in the shit in my opinion.. [ [ Fundamentals Their total revenue has declined the last two years from 2019 27.8B to 2020 25.2B, but shall spike up again to 27.79B this year. In comparisons to another media giant $DISCA which is trading at 41.9 right now, but only has a revenue estimate of 11.87B this year and didn't look too good in its past years of 2020 with 10.6B and 2019 with 11.1B. Which in stock comparisons means that $VIAC should trade at around 80 and not 48.2. I also think that this is a good long term investment as its platforms like Nickelodeon and Comedy Central who are dominating the children's media market, and I don't see why this should stop anytime soon. TLDR: Im comparisons to one of its highs on 22. march at 100.16, it went down to brutal 48.09 and its therefore completely undervalued.

This growth will push sales of VR gear, keyboards, mice, monitors, and desks. All of these products will be prime product categories for GME in the near and long term. One other thing that was emphasized was increased efficiency in logistics and order fulfillment. I assume this is a callback to the recent struggle with next-gen console supply. I think the appointment of both a Chief Tech Officer and Chief Operating Officer who worked previously with Amazon is a clear signal that they're pushing heavily to dominate the e-commerce gaming space and massively cut down on inefficiencies in their fulfillment pipeline. Altogether, in my opinion these administrative changes along with the clearly healthy financial condition of the company give it a solid foundation to build up their online platform and offer better deals to customers in order to remain truly competitive in the market.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-03-24 08:03:52", "id": "mbq2yu"}
{"text": "I have no idea how to write one of these, I just like the stock, and I don't want you Apes to miss out on this. Also i've been suffering with this bad boy as it has been oversold and shorted for the past month. Yes $RKT is absolutely mooning right now. Did you miss the RKT Rocket? Don't FOMO on the way back down to earth. Great news, theres another one on the tarmac ready for liftoff. It's name is $UWMC. $UWMC got a little bit of traction a month or so ago leading up to its earnings report after a massive SPAC deal. Guess what? It absolutely crushed its earnings. UWM reported 4Q20 net income of $1.37 billion and FY20 net income of $3.38 billion, an 821% and 715% increase over 4Q19 and FY19 respectively. This company is just getting started and has massive opportunity for growth. It was trading around $11 and got as high as $12 leading up to the earnings report? What happened after they released news that they absolutely crushed it? The stock plummeted, and it kept plummeting. It had maybe 4 green days out of 30 in the month after its earnings report. Why? Shorts. Who do I hate? The shorts! Additionally, its a great income stock! UWMC declared its first regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share on the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock. The dividend is payable on April 6, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2021. Do you like free money? I would load up on this bad boy prior to March 10th! There are plenty of other catalysts and reasons to long this. It is getting added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 index by the end of this month, and it will absolutely crush its earnings again this quarter. Tomorrow, contracts will be pretty expensive as IV will go thru the roof in the AM, but as of market close there were still very reasonable prices for March, April, and May (post earnings) calls. Look at this activity aftermarket, it is up $1.30 (\\~15%)! I wouldn\u2019t wanna be staring from the sidelines as this stock rockets like $RKT? \\Disclaimer\\ I am Long UWMC and have calls for both April and May. This is not financial advice I just like the stock!! editing to add this dumb ass pun I thought of way too late: I\u2019d MORTGAGE the house on this one. editing again bc I forgot to include the ANALysts PTs if you care about those; average is $11.60, low of $10.50, and high of $13.50. All are bulls. edit x3 since I\u2019m a smooth brain and didn\u2019t include what UWMC actually does and this has gotten much more attention than I thought. UWMC is United Wholesale Mortgage Corporation! They are... as the name implies... a mortgage lender! They mainly fund mortgage loans through independent mortgage brokers. Aka they make bank off of interest... think about how much you smooth brains pay in interest and will pay in interest every month for the next 25 years of your life. You\u2019re paying UWMC. They\u2019ve got a decent chunk of the market, and are continuing to grow. edit x4 for all of you smooth brains that set stop losses and/or freak out when it dips at open on a red day... what do you think the institutions are doing when they see a bunch of dorks on WSB loading up on a new stock? They\u2019re gonna short it to smithereens bc they know how many paper hands are here (there were 1,000,000 available at close yesterday and we\u2019re at 80,000 available currently 12:30 3/3.)

{"text": "Disclaim Not financial advice! First, I am an international student, so my grammar isn't great. Apologize for that first. I see many people quoting the options volume; Trading volume is the number of shares or contracts traded in a given period. And Open interest is the total number of option contracts that are currently out there. These contracts have been traded but not yet liquidated by an offsetting trade or an exercise or assignment. If we are looking for a call chain exercise to cause the gamma squeeze, we should look at the open interest because those are the options not being exercised or offset. I see a lot of saying that HF can cover their entire short position by buying huge call options to cover their short position and become long-sided. First, if they choose to close their position by call option, it would be more expensive than buying a regular share in the market because you need to pay the premium. They may have some hedge option for their short position, but there would always be more expensive to cover their short position by call option. Even they choose to do so, it would likely be done when GME falls to the 40 range, which is the cheapest time to buy a call option in the past two weeks. Most of the call options are open last week or this week which is super expensive; consider the IV. ( I think they didn't even think about covering at a loss) . Then let's take a look at the call option that expires in Mar5. 127232 call options are open, and 31676 call options are in the money. And only the options ITM would be exercised, 31676\\100=3167600, which only 3 million shares. Let make a minimum assumption that the short position they hold is 60% of the float according to finra, which is 60%\\45m=27m short position so, if they exercise those call options, which only cover 11.7% of their short position. It would collapse their whole shot position by interest market price by 100,200,300%. I didn't put the following call options into consideration because there is no point cover their short position multiple times, which could hugely inflate their losses. So, call options can't be a good way for them to cover. Please correct me if I have any mistakes. Position, 104@110 EDIT: Also, they may cover some of their position on the first run-up and short it again when GME falling, but remember that the short borrow interest is as high as over 20%. They lost money for sure, and the interest rate also becomes higher, which makes the second run-up worse for them. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 EDIT2: For those who don't know how option pricing, here is the thing, the more call HF purchase, the more iv it is, and the option price shoots up also. \u200b \u200b", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-03-04 13:47:25", "id": "lxbw9p"}

{"text": "So a few weeks back I posted a DD for $DGX (Quest Diagnostics): [ TL;DR so you can get back to $GME memes: $DGX is the safest double up+ opportunity in the market right now. Based on management's own conservative EPS forecasts (excl repurchases), a PE of 10 at mid year results in a share price of $144. This is the absolute floor target. They also announced unprecedented $2b in share repurchases for 2021, meaning they can repurchase over 16m shares at current levels. Their float is 133m shares, BUT roughly 90% of that is owned by INSTITUIONS, leaving LESS THAN 16m available to public. Assuming institutions continue to hold the majority of their shares (they will. it's a safe dividend stock), this stock will rocket by end of year. ............................................................................................................................................................ As is WSB tradition, my one and only concern (a general market downturn) came to fruition shortly after posting the initial DD linked above. So my sincerest apologies for tanking the market over the last couple weeks. I'm now in your debt and, like a Lannister, intend on paying up. Continue reading unless you hate money. Quest presents a very low risk opportunity to double up at a minimum. No, it probably won't be a 10 bagger, but you'll at least be able to use the tendies to cover your taxes after $GME moons. So here's part 2 of my $DGX callout (read part 1 first you jackass): $DGX has been trading at roughly $11 PE for over 2 weeks now. The share price remains literally FLAT vs pre-Covid February of 2020. Which is hilarious considering: All significant competitors are up AT LEAST 20% in that timeframe. Including Labcorp. Back to back Qs of record breaking Revenue (50%+ y/y) and EPS (100%+ y/y). A plethora of additional reasons from DD part 1 linked above, including $2B in share buybacks announced and approved for 2021. This is practically a ZERO risk trade, which is even more incredible when considering recent market volatility. Since 2006, $DGX has only traded below a PE of 9 once....doing so for a mere 30 days. It has typically traded around 15 PE during that time overall. I know, I know. You're thinking wtf is this guy rambling about historical PEs for. And he already said they are at 11. And 11 > 9, I think, so WHO CARES?! What if I told you that the EPS guidance given during Q4 guidance puts their diluted TTM EPS at 14.38 through Q2 of 2021? To put it more simply for the slow kids in the back munching on crayons, if EPS targets are hit, then $DGX would need to be trading at $144/share to result in a conservative PE of just 10 by Q2. If they return to 15 PE by serology advancements, acquisitions, base testing rush, and share buybacks, the share price would be $216. Key notes: Guidance was only given for first half of 2021. They will beat the top revenue and EPS #s given. They ALWAYS do because this mgmt group is a bunch of sandbagging pricks. They were the kid in school that always said he failed an exam, only to receive a 98 and set the curve for the class. Rev: $4.85b to $5.15b. EPS: $5.07 to $6.07. \\^ They. Will. Beat. Both. Top. Numbers. But my 14.38 minimum EPS above uses a conservative $6 projection anyway. Additionally, management stated the EPS guidance given does NOT factor in an unprecedented $2billion authorization of share repurchases, which is a massive amount when you consider 90% of their outstanding shares are owned by institutions. For context, they seem intent on repurchasing 6x the amount of shares repurchased in 2020. The overblown trashbag \"analyst\" concerns remain the same from DD part 1. COVID testing will just disappear over night and Quest's core business will take a while to return. COVID faucet is gonna get shut off quickly, eh? Yet in reality, public data shows daily testing remains absurdly high. In fact, the lowest testing day so far in Q1 is still higher than the highest day from May-Oct 2020. The overall Q1 daily average remains over DOUBLE that period as well. Heck, even Quest's own press release indicates COVID testing remains absurdly high through Feb for them specifically: [ Even as COVID testing drops off, it will be offset by massive returns in $DGX base work to pre pandemic levels. Personally, I think there's a strong case to be made for a rapid return in their base business as people catchup on postponed doctor visits and procedures. Small boost from employment screenings as well. I've spoken with several Doctor/PA/Nurse friends across 8 different hospitals and they've said that over the past 2 weeks they've seen a dramatic shift in patients. They are SWAMPED, but not with COVID patients. This anecdotal reinforces the bullet above. DGX base business is going to return quicker than people think, AND they will still be able to continue a large amount of COVID testing (still happening based on the #s, just less hospital involvement thanks to drive-throughs and other 3rd parties). The $1.9T stimulus package includes $50 billion specifically for \"testing and contact tracing\". The bill also references an unspecific amount for serology/analytics/researching viruses. Quest also has seen a dramatic uptick in users on their tech platforms: Quest Quanum (provider focused) and MyQuest (patient focused). You can bet they will be able to monetize this data for research too down the road. In this day in age, data is everything. Price expectations by end of year. Raises vs part 1 as I've gained more testing/quest data into Q: Worst case - $150. Yea, I'm serious. Baring a market meltdown, this baby is a lock. Best case - $200 Positions Sold position (2/19 $130 calls) pre-earnings during run up for 400%+ return in roughly 3 weeks Holding: $50k in shares Open: May 21 $125, $130, $140.

There was a vicious bidding war between Verizon and AT&T to acquire the next big 5G telecommunications company, StraightPath. I'm here to tell you history is going to repeat itself in GSAT. \"Globalstar, Inc. provides mobile satellite services worldwide. The company offers duplex two-way voice and data products, including mobile voice and data satellite communications services and equipment for remote business continuity, recreational usage, safety, emergency preparedness and response, and other applications; fixed voice and data satellite communications services and equipment at industrial, commercial, and residential sites, as well as rural villages and ships; and satellite data modem services comprising asynchronous and packet data services. It also provides SPOT consumer retail products, such as SPOT satellite GPS messenger for personal tracking, emergency location, and messaging solutions; and SPOT Trace, an anti-theft and asset tracking device. In addition, the company offers commercial Internet of Things one-way transmission products to track cargo containers and rail cars, as well as to monitor utility meters, and oil and gas assets. Further, it sells wholesale minutes to independent gateway operators (IGOs); and provides engineering services, such as hardware and software designs to develop specific applications; and installation of gateways and antennas.\" Marketplace: 5G is clearly the future of many industries.

The 5G market alone is expected to be worth over 667 Billion dollars in 5 years. This is not even including the EV space, which relies heavily on secure communications (aka GSAT) The Market is setup for a dominant, trusted company like GSAT to overtake. Leadership: David Kagan Chief Executive Officer David Kagan currently serves as CEO of Globalstar. Prior to re-joining Globalstar as President and COO in December 2017, Kagan was the COO of SpeedCast International Limited. He served as President of ITC Global, a premier global VSAT satellite services provider from August 2014 through September 2015. He was also the President and CEO of Globe Wireless from June 2011 through January 2014 when it was sold to Inmarsat PLC. L.

Guys...This man worked for the FCC on the telecommunications act in 1996. He knows the regulations and rules behind telecom industry (5G). Technology, Current Contracts Band53 technology created by GSAT is being used by companies like Nokia and recently Qualcomm. From a press release: \"Globalstar has worked to develop the Band 53 ecosystem with a group of priority partners like Nokia. Globalstar\u2019s Band 53 is a prime mid-band spectrum resource that we offer to our partners for deployment with customers that otherwise would not have access to the benefits of licensed spectrum. The combination of Nokia\u2019s global reach and Globalstar\u2019s Band 53 terrestrial authorizations in multiple countries around the globe present an exciting opportunity for secure wireless solutions.\" This technology is the absolute future of secure 5G connections in not only telecommunications, but also in the EV landscape. Yes you heard it right, GSAT already uses their technology in auto makers such as Fiat Chrysler and Jeep. GSAT has the technology to jump fully into the connected car market, especially the ever poipular EV connected car market. GSAT owns 24 ground stations that serve as points between satellites and over 120 countries. The reach is already there. They are only limited by which contracts they will inevitably pick up. See: Nokia, Jeep, Qualcomm. (So far) Future Growth With the world becoming ever more connected, these smaller but established companies are just waiting to boom.

It's why you see an EARNINGS BEAT and then the shares DIVE OFF A CLIFF. It's shorts trying to inspire a panic. What's very interesting about this short attack was that it was obviously massively coordinated. There are MANY shorts in GME and they are all acting, to some degree, independent based on their cost-basis and level of exposure. Some shorts may actually be switching their positions to go long. In my post here I explain why GME could be legitimately valued at $500 a share.]( \u200b So now that they have tipped their hand that they will try try scare everyone into a Bank Run here are the KEY psychological targets they may drop shares at this week. DO NOT PANIC! \u200b Important price 1: $250If they can 'break' the positive momentum and get the price below $250 that may signal a bank run and collapse the price. They may try this at open on Monday. Important price 2: $300They fought hard to not allow this important milestone to be reached on Friday. If it hits $300 it goes to $350. \u200b Important price 3: $340.20This was their LAST ATTACK and many people will anticipate it again, which may mean a small push will re-create a self-fulfilling prophecy. Important price 4: $350Hitting $350 signals HUGE confidence to the price and it will keep going to $400. Important price 5: $400 At this point MOST buyers are in the money at a profit and you will start to see some profit taking. This may co-incide with a Short Attack to make it look like people are cashing in. Important price 6: $483 - THE ALL TIME HIGH As the all time high is approached many 'smart retards' will think to sell before other people start selling. Everyone is seeing that goal line and it may create more selling pressure as we reach that peak. There will also be less retail buying at these levels since who wants to buy at the peak. The only buyers will be the shorts covering which would just keep pushing the price up IF they get called and or are covering. \\\\TLDR:\\\\There are at least 6 important price milestones at which shorts may attack next week and DUMP a lot of shares for sale in a short period of time.

{"text": "Would/should $AAPL Buy $ZNGA? How about $SNAP? Or $FB? Zynga (yes, the FarmVille one) has had a solid year. They\u2019ve shown good profit and have a strong outlook for 2021. When they\u2019re compared to competitors they\u2019re undervalued by about $5 per share depending on the day. They hold solid market share, and have agreements in place for strong properties (Harry Potter and Star Wars to start). I\u2019ve been reading some speculative rumors that Zynga has been having some discussions about being acquired by a larger company. I\u2019ve seen arguments Snap has a standing agreement with Zynga for gaming, and Facebook will, at some point, need to work more on diversifying. Both want need to expand into new realms of revenue and buying a profitable company with a growing user base would be a solid move. However, I want to throw an idea out there that Apple could have a good case to buy Zynga to bolster their own somewhat feeble (for Apple) gaming division both on mobile and on devices like the Apple TV. There is apparently a new TV coming out, but at what point is that device pointless when a lot of TVs are coming with Apple software native to the TVs OS? To me, the logical expansion is to make it a more gaming friendly console and a good way to do that is to add a suite of games by buying the dev. On mobile the draw is more so to cut out the middle man and add Zynga profits to their own. Zynga also owns rights to some great properties and has a close competitor to Fortnite coming out. This would help Apple fight Fortnite its self and the messy battle that that is turning into. I put some money on $ZNGA for these reasons.

{"text": "I posted a DD about the potential gamma and short squeeze on RKT last night. Here\u2019s my update after today\u2019s fuckery. Real quick disclaimer. I get hype in my posts because that\u2019s what I provide; excitement, facts, and encouragement. I\u2019m doing this because sometimes we need to vent together and re-evaluate the game plan. I get up at 4am every morning, pop an addy and hope for the best/expect the worst. This is why I\u2019m hype, take it or leave it. I also don\u2019t have a job right now. I used to sell mortgages and made a lot of money so now I fucking work my ass off to learn everyday and make a living day trading. Not financial advice. First, let me discuss the elephant in the room. We were so fucking close. RKT was pushing and flagging and ready too moon after its third attempt above 27. That\u2019s the most frustrating part. There was no volume after that so I repositioned lower when I saw the whole market tanking, not just RKT. Here we go again...The VIX (volatility index) has been below 20 this week and bears have raped meme stocks taking advantage of this. I\u2019m sitting there getting pissed off because it\u2019s like every boomer out there needs to suck J. Powell\u2019s D Thursday before deciding if they like a stock or not. They bow down until hedgies decide what they want to do....pussies. Fuck em. The opportunity was there and some wales got in today for sure, but not enough. WSB also didn\u2019t help much because a majority of you think RKT is a distraction from GME. If we just broke 27 we were going to rocket this stock to Mars. I was getting mad at my fellow apes because I imagined you guys sitting there with your dick in your hands waiting for your stimi to come in, and knowing that most of you didn\u2019t know how close we were. It was right there. Then I saw something. The whole market tanked AS SOON AS GME WENT GREEN. It\u2019s comical honestly. Gme is basically a new index. It\u2019s like citadel called in friends to sell their positions before we mooned it. Here\u2019s my take on RKT and GME for the rest of the week. It all depends on the markets reaction to j Powell. The bond and inflation worries have been hurting tech stocks and RKT. My guess is that he will say the same shit as last time...we\u2019re not raising rates. Ok well does the market tank more? I don\u2019t think so. I think will see a sharp decline prior to j Powell then a recovery. That\u2019s my hope. Today\u2019s sell off lacked volume. It was artificial IMO. Hold on to your horses, it could get bloody, but there is always sunshine at the end of the tunnel unless the companies go bankrupt which they won\u2019t. If RKT can bounce back above 26 then we\u2019re right back in the game. Again, there really weren\u2019t many sells until panic overcame the paper hands. Just need wales to get their j Powell fix first and stimis should be clearing banks tomorrow too. If the market is slow and not moving then bears have more power. We need to help make it move. If the market is slow I would by some calls for longer expirations while they are cheap. That\u2019s the great part of downward volatility - cheap calls. Let\u2019s finish the week off positively. We\u2019re in this together. Not financial advice I just like the stock and it\u2019s undervalued as shit.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-03-17 10:41:04", "id": "m6nvqj"}

(be careful reading this next part since I'm retarted and don't know the technicals) (the retartedness actually applies to most of this not just the next part) I don\u2019t know the long-term ramifications of NLY, but what I do know is that it hasn't hit its peak and has the potential to at least be moved to twice what it's at right now by seeing its current trajectory and its former high.

{"text": "A little background to begin. ASO IPO\u2019d in October, it\u2019s trading roughly 100% higher than ipo price. Myself and others have made posts about the business and it being a solid play. It\u2019s a strong company and Er the 30th (Tuesday) , one day before ipo lockup ends. I\u2019m confident it will do well, and see it being \\~$30 by summer no matter what barring a market crash. However I do have a question before I get to my main point: My question is this. Specifically in regard to ipo lockup shares. Can they be lent out for shorting during the lockup period? I\u2019ve searched and can\u2019t find an answer there. It is not exactly important to my next point, but I just actually want to know. ASO is 70% owned by tutes, and by outstanding shares is shorted 15% so not overly interesting in the post covid crash era. 48% of the float is short by the latest numbers though. This kind of leads me to believe that the lockup shares can't be lent, but again, largely unimportant. The really interesting point to be made is this; assuming they do blow er out of the water (very good chance, er estimates were revised slightly up because they doubled expectation last time) we know for certain what range the shorts were opened in. It hit ATH of $28 about 2 weeks ago, so there's some there, however at the time it hit that it already had high 30's % of the float shorted. AKA it hits 29 and every short is losing, 100% guaranteed. So with our er beat assumption and upward price movement, there is an interesting dilemma for the shorts, the IPO shares are locked up until the 31. THEY CANNOT BE SOLD. As far as short covering is concerned they don't exist until the 31. And before the comments come in, yes I know how squeezes actually work, I know not everything is a squeeze, I know this can potentially not happen, I\u2019m not in it for that alone, it\u2019s a bonus. I\u2019m already sold on the business and the strong fundamentals. I\u2019m more curious what other not absolutely retarded folk think (more importantly know) about the ipo share lend availability and if it actually acts a detriment to a potential squeeze happening because of the lockup shares, or if its throwing gas on the fire. Either way I\u2019m expecting a solid er and a nice little run, if for no other reason for the ipo buyers to make maximum tendies.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-03-27 10:34:15", "id": "me2l1f"}

I\u2019ve just started denting my brain by understanding how Fails to Deliver are hid in Out of the Money calls or puts or whatever and now I got to try and understand Payment for Order Flow?! Its like studying for the SAT and then someone knocks on the door and tells you, by the way, you are taking the MCATS tomorrow morning. WTF?! So, apparently PFOF was started by Madoff! I think on the surface it looks legit, but it is easily used for wicked purposes by moving it to dark pools and off market buys, which explains why there is so much buying but it doesn\u2019t move the ticker at all, while sells plummet it in seconds. I guess the SEC looks at this and says, \u2018oh cool, this was started by Madoff and is now industry standard, nothing to see here, would you like a sensual hand job or an angry one\u2019? Is this why Wall Street and Main Street haven\u2019t been the same street in a long time? Since 2008? Earlier? Its starting to feel like Wall Street is one big Ponzi scheme, I know we all know that, but when it happens for real its terrifying! Madoff has been butt fucking everyone since the early eighties, how deep does this rabbit hole go, how deep is his dick still in our rabbit hole? This is my favorite part of his Wiki. \"Madoff founded a penny stock brokerage in 1960 which eventually grew into Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. He served as its chairman until his arrest on December 11, 2008.\\\\ The firm was one of the top market maker businesses on Wall Street,\\ which bypassed \"specialist\" firms by directly executing orders over the counter from retail brokers.\" FUCKING GREAT!!! Then I went digging around and looking at the brokers who adopted this. And holy fucking shit, its almost all of them! TD Ameritrade where all of my funds are at are listed, and Vanguard\\ who I was hoping to transfer to. And now I got to sweat moving my shares from TD, something that makes me extremely nervous, thinking that I might miss out on the rocket launch I\u2019ve been so patiently waiting on. Any talk about moving from TD is simply not on here, lots of talk about Robinhood and Fidelity, but any questions about TD and I get down voted to oblivion. So much FUD, so little time... I remember when Apes figured out shorts were being hid in ETF\u2019s and how big of a bomb that was, this PFOF stuff feels bigger! I don\u2019t think its getting the attention it deserves because we haven\u2019t had any time to catch our breath from all the other bombs dropped, short ETF\u2019s, hidden FTD\u2019s etc. Good luck ever getting this talked about in Congress, they can hardly even address Naked Short\u2019s. They are still learning arithmetic when we need to be discussing Calculus! I\u2019m so angry and frustrated and I don\u2019t know who to blame. Citadel? SEC? Madoff? Myself for being so ignorant on what\u2019s going on? I\u2019m so confused and hoping some big brain apes can help. I\u2019m just a homeless filmmaker, aren\u2019t real adults supposed to be in charge of looking into this? What\u2019s next, I wake up and there is Morpheus telling me to see with my real eyes? Have I become as crazy as all my friends and family think I am about GME? Have we become QAnon? WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!!! This really is the biggest fraud in history and we are the only ones talking about it, isn\u2019t it? This is Madoff, only this time, Madoff is all of Wall Street! Is every broker dealing with PFOF a toxic dumping ground? Is it worth it to move from TD? How long will it truly take? Is every broker fucked? Are we all fucked? All of these institutions are saying, \u2018hey, trust me with your money, I learned everything I know from Bernie Madoff\u2019. FUCK! SHIT! FUCK! I want out! And I don\u2019t know who to trust! I\u2019m angry, scared, exhilarated\u2026 Fuck it, no matter what, if I miss the rocket, if it explodes, if it launches me at 30 G\u2019s into the sun, this has been a wild ride and well worth it. I hope I know what I\u2019m doing, I hope that you do too. But, most of all, I hope that this changes things for the better! I hope all of you Apes are rewarded and safe on your Rocket ride! I\u2019m so confused and don\u2019t know who to trust. The only thing I know is that I believe in the DD and I believe in you fellow Apes. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated, Peace and HODL! TL;DR I think Madoff cut his teeth with fraud with PFOF before moving to bigger fraud feeding off the whales, in the mean time, Wall Street adopted his fraud methods with PFOF feeding off of retail. It really is a big Ponzi scheme. Addendum: You know the phrase, it isn't a loss until you sell? I think in Citadels' mind, it also isn't a buy, until you sell!

With their 180-day sensor having been brought to market last quarter in Europe we should get impressive numbers out of them at earnings. This will establish to investors what the potential market for these kinds of devices will be. Due to the Diabetes epidemic in the United States the market for these sensors will be substantially higher than overseas. Once investors have the data from overseas sales they will extrapolate the potential earnings in the US and the fair value of the stock will rise dramatically. Over the next 2 years this type of technology will become industry standard for reading glucose levels as it saves users from constant finger pricks and will be able to supply doctors with substantially more data into a patient\u2019s glucose levels. As the biopharma industry realizes this data can be used to analyze blood sugar levels in diabetics on a scale never seen before there will be a push from the biopharma industry to make these industry standard in order to accelerate the discoveries of new Diabetes treatments. \u200b \\\\ANALYSIS: ITM CALL BREAKDOWN\\\\ 7/26 $1C Current Premium = $2.55. Delta = .9513 Gama =.0263 Theta = -.0014 Vega = .0021 \u200b This premium is essentially the difference in cost of the current share price and the cost to exercise. Delta is high, Gama is low. This means for every $1 SENS increases the option will increase in value by $.95. Because Gama is low there is little room for the delta to grow past its current place. As the stock price grows deeper ITM Delta will increase slightly. If the stock price dips and becomes closer to the strike price Delta will decrease by the rate of Gama. Theta on this call is very low, it will take a long time before Theta rises to the point where Theta decay will become substantial. Vega is low, meaning implied volatility is considered low on this option. If the price of the stock were to begin to rise quickly Vega will rise as implied volatility increases. \u200b Takeaways from this information \u200b 1. Delta and Gama are already priced into the Call, any growth you would see beyond a 1:1 ratio to the stock price will not come from the stock growing at its current rate. 2. This is a safe call to hold for long term as the Theta is low. 3. Vega is not priced into the call. If the stock price were to begin to grow at a rate faster than it has historically Vega will begin to increase, accelerating the growth of the call. \u200b What are the potential benefits of buying this Call? \\- If you believe the stock has room to continue growing at its current rate this call could be used to take a position in the stock at a discounted price. Instead of purchasing 100 shares for $346 you could buy this equivalent call for $255. If the stock price were to rise from here to $4.46 you would net a similar profit from purchasing the 100 shares or the call but would have needed less starting capital to do so. \\- If you believe that a catalyst is going to be coming sometime between now and EXPY this call would begin to grow in value beyond the rate of the stock price as Vega increases. This is because the higher Vega is not priced into the call at its current premium. \u200b What are the potential downsides of buying this call? \\- As the delta is already high any decrease in the share value will see a 1:1 ratio in the decrease in the Call\u2019s premium. If the share price were to drop to $2.46 from its current price the Delta will decrease the Call\u2019s premium to $1.55. This would be a 40% decrease in the calls value. This is a 10% larger loss of your starting capital than if you simply took the $255 you used for the premium of the call and used it to purchase it\u2019s equivalent in shares. \\- Holding the call rather than shelling out the additional capital to purchase the shares means that you cannot hedge your position throughout its lifespan. If you are holding this call long term because you believe the stock is going to continue to grow at its current rate there will be unrealized gains that you could have made by selling Covered Calls along the way. \u200b Ways to utilize this Call to make a profit: \\- Because this Call has a low Theta it is safe to hold for a while as a stand in for 100 shares. This Call can be used to make gains short-term by purchasing now and selling when the stock hits your target price. By doing so you will earn the profits of 100 shares while having used less starting capital to do so. If Vega increases beyond what it is now than the change in volatility will help to supplement the profits that would have been earned on those same shares. I would think this Call has more value potential than 100 shares if: \\- I believed that there is going to be a catalyst to disrupt its current rate of growth. \u200b A Possible Catalyst for $SENS Could Be: \\- Earnings could show Impressive sales numbers from their European business, showing proof that there is demand and interest for their product. \\- Their sensor being granted FDA approval within the time frame of the call. Either of these catalysts could trigger an increase in implied volatility (raising Vega). \u200b I run the risk of: \\-The stock falling on earnings below a threshold that other positive news could raise it above its current market value. This would result in a loss to my starting capital greater than if I purchased shares with the cost of the premium. \u200b Possible Scenarios: \u200b 1. Earnings creates increased interest in the stock. The price rises faster than it has been historically. Sell offs occur as investors reach their exit price. The price begins to rise again as other investors FOMO into the stock on the dip. As other catalysts form this pattern (large amounts of new investors buying in as long-term holders sell off) continues over a long enough period of time causing the implied volatility of the stock to increase. The share price rises over time on the waves. \\-The already high delta means it is good for a near 1:1 raise in Call value with stock price. \\- The increased Vega from the higher implied volatility also raises the cost of the premium. \\- The call becomes substantially more profitable than shares. \u200b 2. Earnings has very little impact on interest of SENS. The share price grows gradually as its fair value increases. \\-The already high delta means it is good for a near 1:1 raise in Call value with stock price. \\-Vega remains unchanged \\- The calls profitability grows at a rate similar to that of the underlying shares. \u200b 3. Earnings causes a massive shift in interest away from $SENS and the stock price sees a sharp drop followed by a continued bleed until it hits a price where it is viewed as undervalued. \\- The high delta makes the call depreciate quickly \\- Vega will remain relatively unchanged. \\- The Call loses value quickly. For this Call I think the most likely scenario is somewhere between 1 and 2. Whether it be earnings or FDA approval I think there will be continued rise in interest in SENS. \u200b My Position (Entering Monday Morning): 200 Shares (Cost = $692) - I am going to hold these shares long term as SENS becomes more profitable. In the interim I am going to sell monthly covered calls on these 100% over whatever their current market value is to generate a small profit through premiums. Example: The current price is $3.46 as of 2/28/21. I will sell 2 $7C 4/16 for a combined premium of $78. \\----------- 10 X $1C 7/16 (Premium $2.50, Total Cost = $2550) - These will be the base of my position. Purchasing these over shares at current market value saves me $910 in capital. As I believe that SENS will come to be seen as undervalued at its current market price over the next 4 months I should see a profit at minimum equivalent to the shares they represent with the added upside of any increases due to an increase in Vega down the line. \\---------------- 5 X $10C 1/20/2023 (Premium = $2.25, Total Cost = $1115) - These Calls are considerably attractive to me for two reasons. First \u2013 I believe that $12 (The Break-Even Price) by the end of 2022 will be under market value for SENS. Second \u2013 The Greeks present an opportunity to turn a profit short term should my thesis be altered. \u200b The Greeks Delta = .7902, Gama = .0340, Theta = -.0018, Vega = .0136 \u200b For obvious reasons any Call planning to be held long term must have a very low Theta. Vega is priced higher than the 7/16 Calls I broke down, but I believe any drop in premium that could be caused by a decrease in Vega will be substantially offset by the Delta and Gama. A .7902 Delta for a Call that is over 100% OTM is substantial. Gama is high enough that the Delta will increase at a decent rate as the stock grows in price. \u25cf It is worth noting that a Delta this high on an OTM call means that the calls have plenty of room to drop if the share price falls below its current market price, increasing the risk of higher losses on this play. \u200b Exit Strategy: \\- Continue to hold shares and sell monthly covered calls 100% above market value until the rest of the play resolves. \u200b \\- If the value of my 7/16 Calls at any point becomes 200% higher than the value of the underlying shares I will trim 50% of this position. The other 50% will be held until July to be either sold or to be exercised. If these calls maintain a value similar the underlying shares I will hold until July and exercise at EXPY and begin to sell monthly covered calls 50% above market value until the rest of the play resolves or until assigned. \u200b \\- I will hold the 1/20/23 Calls throughout all of 2021. If in 2022 profit levels reach +2000% sell 1. Sell another every time profit rises another 2000%. If profit never reaches target by June of 2022 adjust numbers to +1000%. If by October of 2022 profit targets have not been reached and share price is below $12 close position. If Share price remains above $12 hold until EOY and exercise Calls. \u200b After the Play \\- Continue to sell monthly covered calls of any accumulated shares at 20% above market value until assigned or until information comes up that would compel me to close out my position.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-03-01 08:03:46", "id": "lurtpe"}

{"text": "Hey fellow apes, TL:DR FOR THE MOST ATUIST AT THE BOTTOM Okay, apes thank you for joining me, this has been a glorious week. \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 I would like to discuss GME \ud83d\ude80 and its relationship to AMC \ud83d\ude80 .... or should I say lack thereof? As most of you remember earlier last month we had the big four AMC, GME, BB, and NOK, ring any bells? I understand that a lot of you might be new to the page and subsequently lack this knowledge. Why do I bring these stocks up you may ask ape brother? Well, I will tell you, my hairy friend, where has the relationship gone? Even two weeks ago we would see AMC and GME follow the same trends, mainly AMC would follow GME in movement, up or down. But in the past week, I have started to realize that the relationship no longer is three (or at least what it was late last month). Although this is a theory in the works, I will present to you brothers the plausible reasonings for this new trend. 1) HF are covering shorts on GME inorder to bite the bullet. To explain this simply, AMC is still by far one of the most shorted stocks on the market to this day \u200b F RHOBIN HOOD LICCC MY NUTZ This is crazy, one of the most talked-about shorted stalks on our page has gone up 27.6% in shorted volume in the past month and NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT IT????? THIS SEEMS ODDLY SIMILAR TO THE PAGE MANIPULATION SEEN WITH GME AFTER THE FIRST SPIKE, AND THE RANDOM FLOOD OF 10,000 NEW RKT BUYERS! Here is a link to Investopedia (I know it's not the most reliable to normal humans but to apes, it's like the 10 commandments) [ Why is this significant? 1) It shows something is kinds of sketchy... Our community is built on great investments and currently shorted positions, so why would one of the biggest stocks only a few weeks ago all of a sudden just tapper off? AGAIN THIS IS A THEORY, BUT I THINK THERE IS MANIPULATION GOING ON!!! 2) If the percentages are true, it seems that the HF have less to lose in AMC than they do in GME at the moment. My guess is that they are in a sense taking the lesser of two giant peens in their ass. Why lose 50+ billion on AMC when you could manipulate the focus to GME and potentially see a greater loss. 3) Did we not forget that AMC is not only the largest theater chain in the world but they are now starting to recover from a global pandemic that inhibited profits for nearly an entire year?? I mean I'm no hedgefuck but common sense tells me that going from relatively 0 profit for a year, to suddenly the chance of starting up at full capacity would cause a greater P/L ratio than 10%!!!! 4) AMC IS STILL ONE OF THE MOST SHORTED STOCKS ON THE MARKET!!!!!!! I LOVE GME AND HAVE QUITE A BIT IN IT, BUT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM, AMC IS NOT FORGOTTEN AND SHOULD BE A PRIORITY AS MUCH AS GME. TL:DR: My theory is that HF are manipulating the page to divert attention from AMC to GME so that they don't have to cover TENS OF BILLIONS IN SHORTS. We have seen AMC stop following the same trends as GME in the past week, after weeks of being damn near the same graph. AMC continues to go up in % of volume shorted while GME is easing off short volume (IK WHY, BUT STILL LOOK AT MY POINTS) AMC IS NOT FORGOTTEN APES!!! I am not an advisor I just like the community...

{"text": "Summary Adobe\u2019s powerful position in the professional design and media production ecosystem has given them a valuable foothold in helping their clients get things done. Synergies between Digital Media and Digital Experience will allow Adobe to grow existing accounts as their solutions evolve to support customer operations far beyond creative and marketing. # Profile Adobe views its business in two key segments, Digital Media and Digital Experience. Digital Media (\\~75% of revenue) \u2013 what you probably think of when you hear the name Adobe. Products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by modernizing how they view, share and engage with documents and creative content. Things like Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. Digital Experience (\\~25% of revenue) \u2013 a comprehensive and integrated platform and set of applications and services through Adobe Experience Cloud that enable brands and businesses of all sizes to create, manage, execute, measure, monetize and optimize customer experiences that span from analytics to commerce. Spoiler: this is where my bull case lies. In Adobe\u2019s own words (Form 10-K)| |:-|:-| |Market Cap|$213B| |Forward P/E|41.02| |Shares|479M (Outstanding), 403.5M ( \\~85% Institutionally owned)| |Previous Close (3/12)|$444.30| |52WK Range|$255.13 - $536.88| |Average Volume|2.6M, so liquid enough.| |TAM|Adobe considers its TAM to be $147B by 2023| |Revenue Expectations|Plans to surpass $15B of revenue in FY21| Inside activity \u2013 only two small sales in the last 3 months that weren\u2019t automatic or scheduled. Net activity is \\~300K shares sold (mostly automatic) Buybacks \u2013 Adobe has accelerated buybacks and recently increased the board\u2019s share buyback authorization to $15B, as their original $8B repurchase is expected to be exhausted by mid-FY21. # Climate Adobe has a formidable moat around its Digital Media business segment, with very few competitors to its creative workflow management solutions. With many offices continuing to work virtually, and companies continuing to invest in their creative infrastructure for remote employees, strong growth in Digital Media should continue. Whether they love or hate it, every creative professional knows they need proficiency in the Creative Cloud suite, and probably a subscription to it too. As Adobe says in their 10-K and Annual Shareholder letter. Adobe will also generate new revenue streams from recently-announced public sector use cases, systems integrators (SIs), independent software vendors (ISVs), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions.\u201d* Typical multi-channel, large software company strategy. But these third party solutions providers become incredibly important in highly regulated spaces like government and healthcare. With Adobe's recent acquisitions, and much easier to lock in software solutions as a monthly \"cost of doing business.\" As organizations move to opex models like SaaS, there\u2019s even more stickiness than there used to be. # Technicals P/E ratio of \\~41.02 seems high, but looking at Adobe\u2019s closest competitors shows they\u2019re not the highest. |Autodesk (ADSK)|49.28| |:-|:-| |PayPal (PYPL)|70.72| |Salesforce (CRM)|48.45| |DocuSign (DOCU)|N/A| |SAP (SAP)|29.92| |Accenture (ACN)|32.61| It\u2019s difficult to find a direct comparison, but I think Adobe\u2019s marketing, analytics and e-commerce ambitions make their P/E getting closer to Salesforce very plausible. Part of Adobe's strength is that there's nobody that directly competes with them on all fronts. Analyst Sentiment \u2013 solid buy sentiment from 23+ analysts, which has gone mostly unchanged in the last few months. Lowest price target is $500, with the average around $560-$570. I have yet to see a sell rating. (( Moving Averages and Technical Indicators \u2013 I\u2019ll let others chime in here, because this is my weakest area of knowledge. From what I can see, monthly moving averages and technical indicators suggest ADBE is a semi-strong buy and slightly oversold, respectively. I expect positive momentum to accelerate due to trading at 6-month lows leading up to earnings, BidenBux coming through, and the market forgetting about the 10yr Treasury Yield. (( Remember, this was trading at $500 a month ago. While I think this is worth a long term hold, I also think we'll see it pop when they post yet another earnings beat. # Conclusion Combined with Adobe\u2019s well-known lock-in for professional design and content production workflows in their Media segment, growing competency in their Experience segment will make Adobe extremely competitive as an end-to-end SaaS provider for public and institutional customers. Simply put, I believe Adobe\u2019s Digital Experience segment will grow to be at least half the size of Digital Media, with large enterprise and government partnerships being a sleeping giant in their pipeline.

I'm going to try to avoid bringing my own opinion into this as that doesn't matter. With the millions of new members that have recently joined, there has been a lot of known and unknown misinformation and I've really noticed that it's primarily been in the comments section. Now I know the spotlight has been on GME for the past 3ish months but you all really have to remember that this is NOT a GME subreddit. It's awesome that we have people YOLOing their money into GME but the few quality posts on this sub have been swamped by GME content. INFO There has been hysteria about bots that have been on the sub creating fake content. Now I have no idea whether this is true or not, however, please do not go spreading info around if you are not informed. There have also been posts and comments about \"tactics that short-sellers\" use to manipulate the stock (that I'm not going to name), which aren't even real tactics. Please, don't just take posts or comments about certain info with a \"grain\" of salt or even a \"pinch\". Take the info you see with a fist full of salt. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!!!

Short sellers paid the $1.11 dividend in order to maintain their positions.

{"text": "Reposting as God damnit apes I spent hours going through this and I don't think enough have seen it. Welcome back to another episode of my legal series DD, where brokers manipulate the market and the fines don\u2019t matter. I hear some say, well Citadel has paid fines without a finding out guilt, gave no admission and were censured (which is a fancy wrist slap) when they breached the rules, so they would never do it again right? Wrong. Basically, Citadel has only ever paid a relatively pathetic \u2018oh no I got caught\u2019 fee for each breach, and it barely puts a dent into the cost of doing business. My aim is to help apes, in that bu knowing their history of breaches, this will prepare you for when you see price action related to what we all know to be fuckery from excellent DD. I hope this will give you a better insight into their tactics as the MOASS approaches. These disclosures have been brought up before, but those posts I\u2019ve seen did not go into too much detail, and whilst I appreciate many other brokers have disclosures, Citadel are the ape understood broker with the highest likelihood of being short in GME, so let\u2019s dig in. Buckle up apes, this one may take a little while and raised even my eyebrows. As always, not financial advice, always do your own DD before making any financial decisions. Citadel has a total of 59 disclosures. In order to understand whether this is a lot, I compared them to our friends at Blackrock, who have only 1. There are big boys with more than Citadel mind. Blackrock\u2019s total fines? $2,955 for an omission of fact (likely a clerical error). Citadel\u2019s? $33,425,568 for a whole host of things, and yes, I added them all up to arrive at this number. Whilst I know you may think this is a puny sum for a firm worth billions (and it is), this is the fault of the law on maximum fines, not necessarily the agencies themselves. It's better to look at the staggering relative difference between the 2. Let\u2019s see my highlight reel of the top 10. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #1 - Case 3-17772, 01/13/2017 - $22,668,268 Sanction: Disgorgement/Restitution, Monetary Fine & a Cease and Desist/Injuction Summary: From late 2007 through January 2010; despite Citadel saying they provide \u2018best execution\u2019 for their clients two of their algorithms did not, scalping some $5.2mm from their client brokers. They paid this back with a relatively hefty fee slapped on top and the suit was brought due to fraudulently stating they gave best execution when 0.6% of their trades didn\u2019t in this period.

Fuck me. So what does this tell us? From #1 we know Citadel looks out for itself only, it\u2019ll fuck over their clients, exchange and retail alike to profit. From #2 we know Citadel will report inaccurate data even to its regulatory body to fuck with their ability to regulate properly (SLD and Clearing Fund anyone?). From #3 we know Citadel will use algo strategies which break the rules to profit for themselves. From #4 we know Citadel has a history of failing to properly disclose short positions. From #5 we know Citadel will fail to settle Failures to Deliver. From #6 we know Citadel will abandon their responsibility as a market maker to enrich themselves and cancel orders. From #7 we know Citadel will allow trades during circuit breakers to enrich themselves. From #8 we know Citadel will provide bids below the national best bid for, I imagine, brokers they pay for order flow for (cough, Robinhood, cough). From #9 we know Citadel will mess with orders and then likely DELETE EVIDENCE IMPLICATING THEM. From #10, Jesus Christ, we know Citadel doesn\u2019t give a fuck about market manipulation.

{"text": "EDIT3: WOOOOOOOOO . Not only did earnings beat, but they straightup said that regulations will not negatively impact them and, in some cases, will actually help them. The anti-trust regs against tencent's fintech will open up more room for growth for QFIN. \u201c On the regulatory front, we believe that the regulations brought out recently either has minimal impact to our business, or in some cases, even created favorable environment for top platforms like us. As you may already know, the new ruling from the Supreme People\u2019s Court removed the more restrictive lending rate cap for our business. The new guideline on drug lending and micro-lending has a minimal impact on our business as our exposure to both is quite marginal. On the other hand, China\u2019s antitrust and deleveraging push may squeeze some market share away from the industry giants, which will bring us spill over market opportunities\u201d -CEO This call and the earnings are even better than I was hoping. Now we just need the market to realize it! See you all on the moon. EDIT2: Stock dropped today (3/15) alongside the entire sector. It isn't dropping on its own - all the chinese fintechs, including the ones that are exposed to microlending, are dropping today. Good last minute chance to buy, especially since premarket it was actually up 7% haha. If you're really worried about macroeconomic risk, a good play might be to buy a ITM PUT on a fintech that's exposed, and an ITM call on QFIN. A hedge, so to speak. But personally i'm not doing that. This is a casino, after all. _________ EDIT: Many people have brought up concern that this stock has already tripled and might be played out. I strongly disagree - from a valuation standpoint it is still an amazing buy. It wasn\u2019t the cash flow or loan quality keeping the price down - it was the regulatory risk. As that risk diminishes it will grow to reach it\u2019s fair valuation, which is around 50 using even a conservative growth rate in a conservative FCFE. The real risk is new regulations, or a bigger impact of the current ones, hence why I spent most of this DD talking about them. Right now the market is pricing in regulations wiping out about half of their revenue sources, which I strongly disagree with. The earnings call is Monday at 9PM EST, which is Tuesday morning for QFIN in China. The numbers will be interesting but the real catalyst will be management\u2019s discussion of the impact of regulations. Make sure to place all bets by then! ___________ I have ventured out of my usual territory in my hunt for an exotic rocket ship-shaped banana, and I\u2019ve got good news for all ape-kind: I\u2019ve found one. Here\u2019s my DD (whatever that means). Ticker: QFIN, AKA \"360 Digitech\". They are a Chinese Fintech company. Currently trading around $31.50. Market Cap is around 4.8 Billion. Very few people in America have heard of them. PE is less than 10, growth is insane, plenty of cash on the balance sheet, low leverage, etc. From a fundamentals or cashflow analysis, this is a banana mine. Here's their business model: First, they use their online presence to advertise loans to the rapidly-growing Chinese middle class. Second, they use their proprietary risk-assessment tools to analyze the credit-worthiness of the applicants. They also have proprietary identification tools to help prevent fraud and simultaneously speed up the loan process (this is a bigger deal than it sounds like due to the strong desire for convenience in lending) Third, they partner with banks to supply the capital for the loans. Fourth, they service the loans and deal with recovery in case of defaults. The business model is important because in order to understand why this is an amazing buy you also need to understand where their revenue comes from. It's not just loan interest as you would expect. But first, let\u2019s talk numbers. (In RMB, 1 USD = 6.5 RMB / CNY) 2017 Revenue: 175 million 2018 Revenue: 3.75 Billion 2019 Revenue: 6.99 Billion TTM: 9.19 Billion (TTM means trailing twelve months, this is 4Q2019 to 3Q2020) Obviously that\u2019s insane growth. Most apes can\u2019t even count that high. And yet, despite that growth, their P/E ratio is a measly 9.4! (P/E is a measure of how high up tree us apes must climb to reach banana, lower number = banana more soon) That\u2019s less than half the P/E of the S&P 500 (P/E: 27.5), despite having significantly more growth. To understand why the stock is still so cheap, let\u2019s talk about why dumb apes might NOT want to buy it. Firstly, I assume most of you haven\u2019t bought it yet because you have never heard of it. Do a search for QFIN on reddit \u2013 it\u2019s next to impossible to find mention of it here. Furthermore, the trading volume is extremely low\u2026. And most of the ownership is institutional. A few hedge funds, sure, but mostly ETFs, which is exactly what\u2019s caused this great buying opportunity. As most Chinese Fintech stock prices have struggled lately with regulations (with the exception of this week), QFIN is relatively immune from the changes. QFIN has only gone down because most of the ownership is through the sector ETFs, which have been dragging QFIN down with them. Only recently did it buck the trend and move away from its sector's performance, in large part because people are just now starting to notice it. This is a misunderstood company with obvious value. The play here isn\u2019t that there\u2019s extra value - the value is obvious to everyone - the play is that the \u201cproblems\u201d are being significantly exaggerated and misunderstood\u2026 so rather than tell you where the deep value is, I will instead focus on why the doubters are wrong and why QFIN is uniquely placed in its sector. First Reason for Doubt \u2013 Winnie the Pooh. The Chinese Fintech industry has recently been slapped with some extra regulations that I had to get my mandarin-speaking wife to translate for me. One regulation is that for microlending transactions involving banks and partners, the partners (in this case, QFIN) must contribute at least 25% of the capital. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the rules: [ The stock tanked 30% when this happened. Why it doesn\u2019t matter: According to QFIN\u2019s CEO, Wu \u201cCock Slapper\u201d Haisheng, \u201cCurrently, the outstanding balance of the outstanding loans issued through our micro lending subsidiary, accounts for less than 1% of the total loan balance, and joint lending accounts for around 0.01%. Therefore, based on our personal evaluation, the new rules will have little impact on our loan origination business.\u201d Another new regulation is that online lending can only be done with banks that are established in the same province as the applicant. This is no problem \u2013 QFIN has a multitude of partners in each region. There are other new regulations coming down the pipeline (capital requirements, etc) but QFIN is well capitalized and capable of overcoming all the known issues. Second Reason for Doubt \u2013 Default Risk. There is concern that the loan default rate will be high, especially if China\u2019s economy crashes, and that this will destroy the value of the company similarly to what happened to US banks with bad mortgages in 2008. Why it doesn\u2019t matter: First of all, sack up. Now that we\u2019ve covered that primary reason, the fact of the matter is that default risk will always be a thing for banks. But QFIN isn\u2019t a bank. (Actually, they technically do have a banking charter in case they have to become one for due to new regulations, but they aren't currently using it.) Remember their business model I mentioned earlier? Now consider this: Remember that 9.9 billion revenue for the trailing twelve months? Of that 9.9 billion, 2.3 billion is interest income. (600mm interest expense). Meanwhile, they\u2019re receiving 8 billion in service revenue. (source: [ They\u2019re bringing in far more money from loan origination commissions and the SaaS fees for their credit analysis than they\u2019re bringing in from actual interest income. In other words, they aren\u2019t a bank. What\u2019s even more important is that QFIN literally does have the best proprietary software, as evidenced by the default rates of their loans. Compare QFIN\u2019s loans defaults to FINV\u2019s, who shot up 90% yesterday after their earnings call. Go to slide 17: [ If you\u2019re too lazy to click the link, the TL DR is that QFIN\u2019s historical defaults for every tranche is significantly lower. Another facet to consider is that even if their interest income does drop significantly, their operating margin is strong and, more importantly, improving. Despite their revenue increasing significantly, \u201cTotal operating expenses, excluding provisions were roughly flat Q-on-Q but decreased 33% year-on-year. The year-on-year decline mainly reflects significant improvement in operational efficiency\u201d \u2013 CFO Alex \u201cOh God Please No Not My Face\u201d Xu Third Reason for Doubt \u2013 uNaUdiTeD fInAnCiALs OK so this is the best criticism the bears have. It\u2019s also the most nebulous. A few things to think about: This is a Chinese company with Chinese consumer loans on their balance sheet. The QFIN ticker is an ADR. I\u2019m not an accountant, but AFAIK all of the Chinese fintech companies without a US presence use unaudited financials. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that weird. Speaking of accounting, QFIN has a history of overestimating expected losses. In other words, they used pessimistic estimates that make their financials look worse than they really are. Back in 2Q2020, Chinese regulators slapped a cap on the interest rate of internet-sourced loans. Some of QFIN\u2019s loans at the time were above that rate, meaning they were impacted. An unscrupulous CFO would not have marked down the loans in anticipation of a decrease in value due to the new, lower interest they would be receiving. QFIN did the opposite \u2013 they devalued the loans by too much (mostly because they overestimated the default rate). \u201c...the high take rate for capital-light model in the third quarter, maybe partially contributed to a reversal of the charge in the second quarter.\u201d \u2013 Ethan \u201cProlapse King\u201d Wang, paraphrasing something the CFO took two minutes to explain when asked why the loans were doing better than anticipated after being devalued. What risks are there still? First and foremost, macroeconomic risks. As the Chinese consumer fares, so does QFIN. I view this as a good thing, not a bad one, but it does constitute a risk. Additional regulation from Winnie-The-Pooh represents a risk too, but it looks like, for now, that storm has mostly passed. My take is that the Chinese regulators seemed to have a hard on for fucking up Ant Group \u2013 a spinoff of Alibaba. Jack \u201cActual Vampire\u201d Ma had mouthed off publicly about regulations and so the CCP went after him with even more regulations after disappearing the guy for a month. Ant Group focuses more on microlending, but QFIN\u2019s stock got dragged down by the bears despite not really being exposed to microlending. Ant group is finally approved for their IPO, so it looks like Winnie\u2019s red rocket for regulation is rapidly retracting. Any big banana showers coming soon? YES! Earnings call on 3/15! QFIN has a history of smashing earnings estimates. If QFIN has even half the success of FINV, who went up 90% on the day of their earnings call, then it\u2019ll be bananas for everyone. Apes taking a rocket ship to banana planet. If you still aren\u2019t convinced just look at the fucking fundamentals you god damn baboon. TLDR: I like the stock. \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 This is obviously not financial advice.

{"text": "As I'm typing this on February 28th, a sunday night, looking at DD posts for gamestop, I could have never imagined me saying what I'm about to say on here of all places. I am 21 years old and I have gambled upwards of over 1 million dollars since late 2019. Let me explain. I come from a family that is extremely educated. All my siblings are doctors and my father is an engineering professor. Many of my siblings left right around when I started high school. Despite the great success of my family, things have not always been perfect. My father is an immigrant and is extremely cheap, callous, cheap, manipulative, and did I mention cheap? We lived extremely modestly in a wealthy area because they had good school districts. My family has often struggled to make friends of the whole family and my parents kept very weak connections with their family members. There have been many traumatizing moments for me including infidelity, abuse, and screaming that I have had to deal with since I was a child. In high school all of my siblings were moved out for their careers and education. Things started to really suck without them to say the least. My house has always been a complete dump. My parents and my sister have hoarding problems. Most of the house is unable to be walked through and has been for over 10 years. I have never invited any friends over because of how bad it looks. I think this is some psychological defense against outsiders, but I'm not sure. In my junior year of high school things began to go poorly and my parents stopped talking to each other for over a year and a half. I had to pass notes from the upstairs and downstairs rooms which they each lived so they could discuss things. It felt horrible. I was never one to quit so I continued on and had an amazing year outside of home. I showed up to school every day with a smile on my face and was loved by teachers and other people. I was one of the best students in the whole school. From then till senior year I won multiple awards, finished top % in basically every metric and was accepted to multiple institutions for tough undergrad programs and received many scholarships. That brings us to today. My first year of college wasn't very exciting. I lived with a friend I've had since middle school and we explored the independent life. Sophomore year something happened, though. I saw an ad on instagram from an NFL player I loved promoting an app to make live sports bets. This wasn't traditional betting but rather a game that involved bets. I downloaded it and soon became hooked. I was great at it, they had a weekly contest I was winning hundreds and sometimes even $1000 on almost every week. I couldn't stop thinking about it. This was my own money. I had never had this money before. I bought shoes, a BRAND NEW iPhone which I still use today, and other needless things. After the app began to lose money and go broke I stopped doing it until junior year when I got into REAL sports betting. I deposited $500 of internship money into an account and turned it in $5000 in two weeks. I was hooked. My methodical strategies began to turn into madness. I would bet large sums on anything that was on. I had originally used this money to buy myself a car. My dad has a net worth of a few million but had refused to get me for years and made me ask my roommate to take me everywhere for years while making fun of him. I hated him for it. Once I lost my original $4500 profit I began to spiral. I used everything and maxed out my credit cards to bet. I had an obsession with betting the under ( this is basically what shorting is in the betting world). Soon I began to bet on things I couldn't watch: Russian table tennis, chinese basketball, turkish soccer, whatever was offered. I had to tell my mom what happened and she was in shock. She said this should not have happened and I will get you help. My dad sent me over 13k to pay off everything. I became so enraged I had cost them this I did it again a second time. Another 13k. I promised them it was over and after mulling they sent me the money again. Except I never stopped. I managed to stay alive continuing my habit by either needing money \"for new classes I'm signing up for\", coasting off of scholarship money I had to pay for classes, or getting lucky and paying off debt. Most of school I did the bare minimum and really only cared about my bets. Punched in live bets at the gym. In class. At Home. During Spring break. If I could I would bet. In January I had managed to pay off a 2k deficit and had 6k of money, in my hands, with no debt. Today I owe 11k. For just one second I wondered if I was even worth being alive. At this point my parents have basically disowned me unless I turn over my entire life to them. They don't know I never stopped. This is where Gamestop comes in. I decided I would never gamble sports again and put my last 2k of profit into a brokerage. In late January I used my last 2k to buy 22 shares of gamestop at $88. I was lost in the movement staying up almost every night for premarket and checking my phone over 12 hours a day. I remember waking up to seeing 10k in my account from my shares. I didn't sell. Eventually I paper handed after robinhood stopped allowing buy of GME. With my small profit I returned to the market and built my account back up. Lost most of it and last week I bought 23 GME shares this time @ 116. My whole portfolio. Truly I don't care what happens anymore. I just like the stock. I'm not scared of anything and if I lose it all then I'll just make sure I remember how it felt to have nothing when I make it in this world one day because I know I will. Nobody knows this, my roommate has lived with me for 4 years and is one of my best friends and actually thinks I'm doing well financially because of my early success. Today I watched the movie flight and I just felt like I had to get this off my chest somehow after watching the final few scenes. I don't plan on speaking to my parents much again, they probably won't be at my graduation, and I wake up every day hating the decisions me and them have both made in our life. Right now GME is all I have. I'm here to shout to the rooftops why I'm here and where I'm from, this can happen to anybody. I don't want sympathy I just want to go to the moon. Apes strong. This is not financial advice. I just like the stock. a lot. 23 @ 116", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-03-01 13:41:34", "id": "luz2g4"}

This is one I think is still really early and I through some DD together below for anyone who invests in this sector. The MLSE is Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment. They own the Leafs, Raptors, TFC and several others. They're now yet another huge partner going cashless and using this tech to do so. NR below for anyone wanting to read that: [ In a nutshell, XTM ($PAID /$XTMIF) is essentially a neo challenger bank that focuses on one of the biggest problems that most hospitality companies face -- cash is annoying to work with. XTM solves that issue with their Today Card which is a MC backed payment card. It enables restaurants and delivery companies to pay their staff instantly at the end of each day by simply topping up their Today card. The Tech: Backed by AWS, RBC Bank, and Telpay Acquisition cost per user is $2 CAD (most banks can be upwards of $200 and other challenger backs range $1-$38) Allows employees to be paid instantly from mgmt (eliminates having to deal with cash) Anyone with their Today card can etransfer at no cost between each other * Use the card like you would any bank card when making purchases What really caught my attention with them though is who's been coming on board since covid hit. They've got the who's who from the Greater Toronto Area signed up (Pizza Pizza, Earls, Dominos, Cactus Club, etc). But its todays NR that gives such a bluesky feeling as these are huge names to not only begin switching over to their system, but have also invested in their recent raise. NR: [ Mike Kimel - This guy is the Chairman for Harlo Entertainment. Quick search of the investments his company works with paints a picture of how many places he can bring on board XTM [ David Grutman - I had to look him up but this guy is massive in Miami. His company Groot Hospitality owns a lot of the downtown Miami core and again, I bet he switches a good amount if not all of his companies onto XTMs Today card too [ David Bolno - Looking into him more you'll find out he manages money for Drake and Bieber and has some serious connections across North America [ These are 3 huge names to bring on board and they're a big reason why I think this company is about to explode as more and more restaurants/clubs/delivery companies come on board.

Just because it is nearing its ATH does not mean that it cannot go higher. I do not believe that its old ATH is an accurate valuation of the company, and so I believe it will break through that price.

{"text": "This is a continuation of a DDDD I wrote a few weeks ago about how GME could cause a stock market crash of the transaction might default on an obligation. To put it simply, imagine Bob sells Alice one GME call with a $10 strike price. Unfortunately for Bob, some \ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d in an obscure subreddit sent GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d so when those calls expire, GME is at $410, meaning Bob now owes Alice $40K. However, Bob\u2019s entire portfolio is worth only $10K and is unable to fulfil his financial obligation when he wrote those GME calls, defaulting on it. # Counterparty Risk in 2008 & the \u201cSolution\u201d This is exactly what happened in the 2008 Financial Crisis when AIG sold Credit Default Swaps (basically, puts on the housing market) and defaulted on their financial obligations when the housing market collapsed. It made everything worse, because other funds were using these CDS to hedge their own positions in the housing market, so when those CDS turned out to be worthless because the other side was bankrupt, it endangered the financial soundness of firms like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, BoA and Marril Lynch who bought these swaps. This suddenly created a counterparty risk to anyone on the other sides of all the trades they have made, and has a domino effect that ends up with basically every financial institution collapsing if AIG collapses; in other words, AIG was too big to fail. Title 7 of Dodd Frank, which was the law passed by Congress as a response to the Financial Crisis to prevent this from ever happening again, mandates that all securities and derivatives be cleared in clearing houses such as DTCC and post collateral they deem to be sufficient to manage counterparty risk to them. These clearing houses would then be responsible for ensuring a transaction is fulfilled on both sides, and if one of the parties in the transactions fail to meet their obligation, they are responsible for honoring it. # Why this doesn\u2019t really work What this solution has effectively created is one monolithic central counterparty in the form of the DTCC. According to their 2019 annual report because they didn\u2019t have enough cash to cover it. What happens if a participant can\u2019t meet their collateral requirements? Similar to a degenerate options gambler who can\u2019t meet their margin call (aka your average r/wallstreetbets, their entire portfolio gets liquidated. See, DTCC not only is a central clearing house that guarantees most settlements; technically that\u2019s the NSCC, which is a subsidiary / service provided by the DTCC. Their main operations are the equivalent of a central bank for brokerages - the broker of brokers, responsible for holding the physical shares that the brokerages own; hence their name Depository Trust Clearing Corporation. So what does it take to bring the DTCC down? Most recently, GME. For those who haven\u2019t seen it yet, this interview with the Chairman of Interactive Brokers (apparently post gets auto-deleted if I put a YouTube link, but should be easy to find) on why they halted buying of GME outlines the issue pretty clearly. For those with too short of an attention span to click the link, he basically says The most important reason why he halted GME purchases was to protect the integrity of the financial system and clearing houses There were ALOT of options that suddenly became in the money, and whoever held them suddenly were owed a bucket of tendies; he mentioned $10-15B losses in one expiry date alone. These tendies need to come from somewhere. Anyone who was net short GME got absolutely fucked and might defaulting on their short position or call option write. If they default, the broker is on the hook to pay out those losses. If the broker cannot pay for it, they go under and clearing house (DTCC) is on the hook # Tin Foil Hat Time Now here\u2019s where I\u2019ll start speculating on what exactly happened on the other side of the trade and DTCC. So, who\u2019s on the other side of all these GME calls, or in other words, who wrote all these calls and suddenly owes fuck ton of money when GME \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf1d? Probably Citadel, which is involved in over 99% of all options trading volume and when the underlying is illiquid relative to the notional exposure value. I\u2019m too lazy to actually research this data, although I\u2019m almost certain this is true (someone pls fact check me), but it\u2019s extremely likely that at a certain point, the amount of shares Citadel needed to buy to remain fully delta hedged on all the options they wrote exceeded the available float, and became literally impossible to do. This is because a large portion of the options they wrote were out-of-the-money, meaning that although they don\u2019t need to buy a lot of GME shares when they first sell the contract to be delta-hedged, they would need to drastically purchase more and more shares if GME goes up, causing it to go up even more and becoming a vicious cycle (i.e. gamma squeeze). Usually, market makers might use other strategies like buying similar tickers or ETFs holding GME to try to remain delta neutral, but there\u2019s so much volatility that it\u2019s possible that Citadel was in fact net delta-negative on GME - on in other words, they lost money if GME goes up. Okay, so let\u2019s make a logical jump (with no evidence) to speculate an idea - what if Citadel\u2019s financial soundness came into question? In other words, what if they were at risk of bankruptcy and ended up defaulting on their financial obligations? Well, they\u2019re involved with over 99% of all options trades, and if they default then the DTCC is suddenly on the hook for unwinding their massive portfolio and ensuring that all of Citadel\u2019s financial obligations, including paying out all those GME calls, are met. Obviously, DTCC does not want this to happen, and as a private corporation, they are allowed to do whatever is in their best financial interest to preserve their own financial soundness to ensure their business is not at risk that is allowed within the financial regulatory framework they operate in - including raising GME margin requirements. TLDR; DTCC is definitely too big to fail, so they get broad sweeping powers by financial regulation to make sure they don't fail. Citadel is probably too big to fail in DTCC's eyes because they don't want to be responsible for honoring 99% of all options transactions.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-03-10 09:34:29", "id": "m1jksq"}

{"text": "This just burned me even though I thought I understood the pattern day trade rule and I can't trade on margin in my account for 95 days, so I wanted to share this with other new investors retards so they don't get burned by the pattern day trade rule like me. This is not investment advice, this is clarifying SEC-mandated regulations on what counts as a \"day trade\". Also, this is probably obvious to you seasoned artists (it is to me after Fidelity explained this all to me on the phone), but smooth-brained apes like myself might not understand this, or even panic at waking up to any margin call for $25000 (note - if you don't meet this you're not on the hook for it - you just get restrictions placed on your account for some time). Or maybe you read the many topics on day trading available on the internet and came to the same (wrong) conclusion as me. Pattern day traders have different margin requirements than interday or non-pattern day traders. A pattern day trader is classified as someone who \"day trades 4 or more times in a 5 day period\", and a day trade is classified as \"the opening and closing of securities on the same day\". What sites don't explain better is that this is based on the number of open positions, not the number of times you sell. For example, Fidelity explains day trading on margin, so in 5 days my account will be restricted to cash buying only for 90 days (though I can't trade on margin for the next 5 days anyways so it's basically 95 days), and I need to avoid day trading at all in that account or else the counter may reset. After 60 days of no day trades in the account, you revert to non-pattern day trade status, but for missing the minimum equity call you still can't trade on margin for 30 days after that. I have a cash account I usually day trade out of, but I impulse closed all of my other positions (besides GME) and YOLO'd into RKT. I profited nicely of of yesterday but this was the result of my greed. I at least have a decent amount of cash to invest after yesterday (and I did buy 5 more GME shares today, still holding 27 RKT positions), but I would not have bought 92 shares over several orders had I understood this would result in 5 day trades for the separate positions I had opened, not just one trade for the single sell order. Last thing I want to mention: don't trade on margin unless you know the risks. And if you are unsure of anything, you can always call your broker. And if you can't, stop trading on CashApp or RobinHood and get a real broker you absolute mong. As for me... well I just bought 5 more shares of GME this morning with cash so maybe y'all can help me meet that minimum equity call :D (just kidding, this is not investment advice).

{"text": "Hi guys, I want to preface that I'm all aboard the GME train and I'm not a bot. I promise. But I also FOMO-ed into UWMC and need some confirmation bias haha. Anyway, I wanted to have a discussion about the OI change in options, on UWMC. I usually download the changes in OI from Barchart every day, and look through to see if anything looks interesting and investigate further. Here is the Excel filtered for UWMC. Now we can't be sure at all what the intent of the whales opening these positions are doing. Of course there are going to be covered calls, and credit spreads. In fact, this might likely be the case because IV is pretty high for UWMC, historically speaking. However, there are quite a bit of 3/19/21 exp dates calls that were opened, going from $10 strikes all the way up to $25. The OI on the 12.5C / 15C are huge, sitting at 55K and 70K respectively. It seems like there is the potential here for a gamma squeeze. Once again, I'm not an expert, but if these are all calls that were buy to open, then someone could be gearing up for a squeeze next week or the following week if they can get some momentum on the price to the upside. This could be similar to what we saw with GME last week. I think what would help is if someone had access to Bloomberg, and could see when these trades happened. Since we had a pretty wild day yesterday, I think if we saw that the orders were placed at market open, while the stock was jumping higher, it would mean a lot different than if the orders were placed at the lows of the day. My belief is that if the orders were more towards the end of the day, it would be a higher chance of someone betting on a squeeze, but I could be completely wrong. Anyway, just wanted to get a discussion going with you guys. I'm obviously bagholding here, got about 500 shares at a price much higher than what it's currently at.

{"text": "$1.9T stimulus has been a foregone conclusion. Everybody knew it would be passed. And though it could cause a sugar rush in a correcting market pushing it up, it's impact is expected to die down fast. Big money has been flowing out of big tech (which makes up a big % of Nasdaq and SP500) and into value and reopening plays. The stimulus is likely to make tech rally again, only for the rug pull to be imminent. I hope everyone is aware of that. Why do I say that? Because of the rising 10Y yield. The very reason tech has been draining for the past month. Just so you know, the more fiscal spend the bond market anticipates in the coming months or year, the bigger the bond sell off. It makes sense on their part because they expect all the fiscal spend is going devalue the dollar and make inflation a highly likely outcome. Inflation is the enemy of bonds. So the bond vigilantes, in anticipation of inflation in the future, is selling their holding and driving up the yield. The movement up on the yield if steady wouldn't have been a problem, as it would have been more indicative of economic growth. But the recent huge spikes are indicative of a different story boiling under the surface: inflation. Now, whether we would actually have inflation or not is not the problem here. Mere expectation of inflation is enough to make big money scared and rebalance their portfolio. If big money starts believing the inflation narrative, the impact would be observed in the violent swings of tech and equities in general. The administration has already made it clear that they plan to big on fiscal spend in the coming years. The Fed has already made it clear that wouldn't be raising interest rates anytime soon - because raising interest rates now would mean slowing down the economy and thus making the efforts so far futile. But, things don't end here. If there is no response to the 10Y sell off, the bond vigilantes might just mount even more pressure on the yield making it push up over 1.75. What impact does a steeping yield curve has? It makes borrowing tougher than say one year ago and also it makes tech's future cash flow discount more, thus making their current valuations unattractive. The treasury auction due to happen this coming week is going to say a lot about the bond market sentiment. If it goes badly, it is even more worrying speaking in terms of equity volatility and the 10Y yield. All eyes are currently on Fed and JPOW for the upcoming FOMC meeting this month. Since raising interest rate is highly unlikely and there is bound to be fiscal spend in the future (accommodated by low interest rates), it is a strong possibility that Fed might resort to Yield Curve Control to temporarily calm the 10Y yield - another term for this Operation Twist. In this unique practice of QE, rather than buying short end of the YC, Fed shifts their purchases to the long end of the YC, in order to flatten the curve and keep borrowing rates low. But, what is the cost of this? The cost of this dollar devaluation and unattractive treasury bonds. If Fed resorts to YCC, expect equities to roar back again. If they raise interest rates or do nothing, expect equities to struggle at least in the short term, before there is some sort of stability in the long term bond market. TLDR: Stimulus not big news for the market, will most probably be a sugar rush. Look out for the treasury auction this coming week - if bad, yield will probably spike even higher. Biggest event in March is the FOMC meting - will either make or break the market in the near term.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-03-08 04:24:19", "id": "lzwegv"}

{"text": "TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM FOR THE RETARDS WHO CAN'T READ. \u200b Alright buckle up retards today we're going to answer a question that has managed to elude retards and algorithmic options traders who use Robinhood to exploit their free option trades for years. Why the fuck is option order routing so bad? It always seems like I'm the last order to fill. Well let me answer your question with another question What happens after you submit an order on Robinhood? That we do know the answer to, and we shall go through it very quickly. Robinhood has their own order router, this does all the \"paperwork\" a trade needs for it to be able to be processed by a Market Maker, or by the execution venue. So firstly, your order is sent to the RH order router, this first checks basic stuff, dividend risk, collateral req. checks, avail; funds checks, margin checks, and a PCO(position closing only) check. If any of that returns a false argument, the order is kicked back. If that's all good, the order is flashed onto the PFOF desk at Citadel Securities, they pay top dollar for the sweet, sweet dumb money pfof, that they will always adjust their books so that RH's order router routes to them first. Now Citadel has a set time to do with this order(because the exchanged price is still changing and of course its not public which is fucking fair right?). They can one: if the limit order on the marketbale option order is theo(theoretical price) + edge(which is hidden information due to game theory reasons), then the MM will fill you. This can and does lead to something called price improvement. For example if the 69c for $ASS is trading at a spread of 0.69-0.86, with a theo of 0.74, the MM takes a 0.04 edge on the position, so any order above 0.78 will fill, which is technically better than paying 0.86 at the ask. The problem with this however, is the rights to your order. Customer orders are supposed to have priority over MM orders on marketable option and equity tickers, BUT, MMs and Citadel rather take your order \"hostage\" with their own order placed on your behalf with flags set on the trade that a retail customer cannot set on their order. I've been trading GOOGL intraday calls and puts, and discovered that orders that I was competing against would fill before me, even though I was supposedly the first one on the books(read exchange) on that price. So what? you might say, \"you got unlucky\", no I, you, or anyone else getting buttfucked by Robinhood is not \"unlucky\". The vast, vast majority of option and equity exchanges operate on FIFO w/contingencies. FIFO(First in First Out) means the first person to put up their sell, and first person who put up the bid side will be matched with each other, there is no luck to who gets an order, it who put in that order first. Now \"w/contingencies\" is supposed to be in the retail traders benefit, because that states that, even if a MM places an order before a customer, the customer will still be first. But clearly if you ever traded options on Robinhood, you'd realize that's not the fucking case. So what the heck is goin' on? I've done many hours of research to come to this conclusion, but all it is my best educated guess, with my knowledge of option order routing. Nothing about how Citadel routes orders, their edge threshold or how much time they hold the orders before moving it somewhere else(read different MM) is all private due to game theory reasons. I am going to assume that once your order hits Citadels PFOF screens, and they don't want to fill your order at the current price. They will fire an identical order on their end, to the exchange, on your behalf(while nullifying the original order), this removes the CUST order specification, and allows them to get you the worst possible fill, while still giving you the BBO. Certain MM flags exist that actually allow last priority of an order, and it's very possible that they place that on your order. This will 100% of the time have your order be the last one on the books before the bid or ask changes. \u200b Last Priority MM Order Flag for Citadel, or the MM who picks up your marketable option order. So Citadel wants good fills, and a good edge, so they have to fuck someone over to get that. What can I do about it? On other(read real) brokers, you can have your orders sent directly to your desired exchange, without sending directly to a market maker(a market maker can still fill the order on-the-screens), however your order will still have that holy CUST order specification. On Robinhood, there is nothing they can do unless they add execution options and options for specific order instructions, which they won't do. \u200b tl;dr - When buying options, Citadel likely puts your order on the screens on your behalf(instead of your original order from the app), doing this loses the CUST order specification, which gives your order priority over MMs, and customers trading on brokerages that can shoot orders directly on the exchange will have priority over you. That is the most probable reason as to why Robinhood's order routing is trash.

Now we know that after AMC finished above $8 on Friday that a gamma squeeze should\u2019ve happened. It has not yet. The volume has been too low. Under SEC regulations, those shares need to be delivered by 9:30 AM EST four days after the expiration date of the contract was exercised, that is tomorrow.

{"text": "This is my first DD, feel free to go in raw and no rubber, nuts to butts with your criticism 1. Backed by the CCP \u201cGenerally speaking, the Chinese government has been willing to pull several policy levers to support the EV industry. These include incentives such as purchase rebates and tax exemptions. For instance, the government had restrictions around securing a license plate to limit the number of new vehicles on the road to reduce pollution. However, several local governments have been lifting these restrictions on the purchase of new EVs.\u201d - ([ The CCP has previously given $NIO government subsidies, as well as implementing pro EV and pro $NIO policy changes, showing that they are willing to be active supporters of $NIO both financially and in regards to favorable legislation. If $NIO is in trouble, the CCP will not want them to go under, as they are arguably China's biggest contender against $TSLA in the EV market. \u200b 2. Reasons for recent price movements There are two causes for the recent price movements. $NIO started to decline following the release of its quarterly earnings, despite them not performing particularly poorly. From the Earnings Report: Vehicle deliveries were up 42.2% from Q3 Vehicle sales were up 44.7% from Q3 Total revenue was up 46.7% from Q3 Gross margin (How much money the company retains from sales) was up 4.3% from Q3 While the earnings report may not have completely met analysts\u2019 expectations for the company, they still show that $NIO continues to grow as a company. The second potential cause of $NIO\u2019s decline is that it\u2019s just following the trend of other companies in the EV industry. This argument is much more valid than earnings, at least in my opinion, but I believe that there is still an argument to be had in regards to this. The combined market cap of EV manufacturers is allegedly lower than that of traditional auto manufacturers employing internal combustion engines in their vehicles (Source: [ \u200b 3. Market Cap compared to competitors $NIO(55.15B) has a lower market cap than both $TSLA(540.40B) and $GM(79.22B), and there is a significant amount of room for $NIO to grow in the future. The market cap of $TSLA shows us the potential that a successful EV company has if grown correctly. \u200b 4. Potential for future growth Although $TSLA vehicle sales/deliveries are far better than $NIO\u2019s, if $NIO continues its consistent growth into the future it isn\u2019t unlikely that we will continue to see share prices increase into the future. $NIO also has plans for expanding into foreign markets. Currently, they have only sold vehicles in China, but CEO William Li has announced plans to expand into international markets soon(European markets the second half of this year, and he plans further expansion in 2022, Source: [ So far, $NIO has only sold cars in 1 country, but there are 195 countries in the world, so by 2022 we should expect the market cap to be 10.725 Trillion dollars /j \u200b 5. The actual products In order to drive an EV, you obviously need a charged battery, because driving with no power is something you can\u2019t do. With Teslas, you need to charge your car for 30 minutes without a supercharger, or one hour without one before being able to drive 44 miles (source:[ however this is not a problem with Nio cars, because of their Quick Swap battery system.

{"text": "TL;DR \\- Bullish count (Primary) currently in control, with impulsive upside action; 5 waves complete at 227.00. Minor pullbacks expected as wave (1) of (iii) completes between $286 and $322. Breaking resistance at 231.02 confirms upside. Holding above support keeps further downside as alternate count. Resistance (wave i): 231.02 Major Support (wave 4): 172.50 Minor Support (wave ii): 183.58 Discussion After watching GME pullback in corrective fashion in overlapping waves finally completing at 183.58 today, wave 1 of iii took off, and completed five waves quickly (which we would expect in a 3rd wave such as iii), extending beyond the standard .618 extension of i from ii, nearly hitting the .764 extension before turning down at 227. This completes 1 of iii of (1) of (iii). We now wait to see how far 2 retraces 1, and from 2 we can more accurately calculate these minute subwaves. However, with 1 extending beyond a standard fib target, each subsequent wave should also be lifted by the same number of fibs surpassed. In lifting these targets, we have the following regions: 3 \\~ 264; iii \\~286; (i) between 286 and 382. Conclusion: As long as the minor support holds, we have room to run. Only a break of 183.58 forces us to consider today's upside as a new b wave of an incomplete ii. A break of 172.5 forces us to consider that the large green 4 has not yet completed. Alt yellow count remains, but as long as new supports are developed and held, we shouldn't worry about that for now. ENJOY the UPSIDE! Big Picture post coming this weekend after markets close.

Who is Hindenburg Research? \u201cHindenburg Research\u201d is a tiny 5-man shop, and then they just take their profits and move on to their next target. They don\u2019t care if they are right or wrong on their \u201cresearch\u201d because they will profit on their short position regardless. Their ideal targets are early-stage growth company stocks that have a low float \u2013 these types of stocks are more volatile (thus, allowing them to make exponentially higher profits from their short positions after releasing their \u201creports\u201d). Here are examples of other stocks they have attacked: $CLOV, $SOS, $MVIS, $JCOM \u2013 to name a few. \u200b Where do they get their research? This is the million-dollar question. They rarely cite their sources, yet they produce very detailed reports. These reports historically contain many inaccuracies while damaging the reputation of legitimate companies and hurting retail investors like us. In their most recent attack against ( on Friday, the basis of over half of their report is based on \u201cconversations they had\u201d with undisclosed \u201cformer employees\u201d of the company. Former employees??? That is their source??? These are probably ex-employees that got fired. That is the equivalent of someone asking my ex-girlfriend what she thinks of me.. Don\u2019t imagine she\u2019s going to have too many nice things to say. \u200b Here is why what they did to Lordstown Motors is wrong: Let\u2019s be clear. This is no Nikola. Hindenburg neglected to contact Lordstown Motors for a tour of their ( and refused to take a test drive of their Alpha Endurance vehicle. Hindenburg also RUSHED the publishing of their report during a \u201cquiet-period\u201d right before earnings this Wednesday because CEO Steve Burns mentioned in a ( that production is on track for September, and, starting on March 17th, LM would begin reporting actual orders instead of pre-orders. Lordstown Motors has already said they are preparing to release a ( and will \u201cabsolutely\u201d be refuting the Hindenburg Research report. \u200b In summary: I will include a link to my full DD post / Hindenburg rebuttal in the comments below as well if you want to read a more in-depth analysis into Lordstown Motors and their business model. They are initially targeting fleet/government/business contracts with their truck. Disclosure: I am long $RIDE and felt like these allegations from Hindenburg Research were unfair to Lordstown Motors and investors alike. In addition, I\u2019ll let you be the judge \u2013 should Hindenburg be allowed to continuously get away with these attacks? What I love most about this WSB community is that we can come on here and speak freely when we feel like us apes have been wronged. I wanted to raise awareness into what Hindenburg Research has been getting away with and hopefully prevent it from happening to you in the future. \u200b I\u2019ll leave you with this question: Who has more credibility in the following scenario? A 5-man \u201cresearch firm\u201d ran out of an apartment in New York or a company with 500+ employees, the 3rd largest automotive plant in the country, and the backing of two different multi-billion dollar corporations via investments and partnerships.. The answer here is pretty obvious. Almost 20 million $RIDE shares were shorted on Friday as a part of this attack. I think this weekend is a great time to rally the troops and make sure those that didn\u2019t close out their short positions get burned this week \u2013 and it begins tomorrow. $RIDE or die baby! #MadeInAmerica \u200b TLDR; Hindenburg Research attacked a company based out of a small town in Ohio that is producing electric pick-up trucks for the hard-working men and women of this country. The American dream is all about building a company from the ground-up that will make the world a better place \u2013 for Lordstown Motors, that means bringing the first full-size electric pick-up to market this September. The goal of this post is to raise awareness into what Hindenburg Research has been getting away with and refute their allegations into Lordstown Motors.

{"text": "Not a trading advise. Following on my comment earlier today, I asked if there was any interest in some bullshit TA for next week since the entire WSB front page is full of legit DD including all kind of mammal pictures. I\u2019m going to keep it as clean and simple as I can using area charts instead of candles. I believe support and resistances are better visible this way. It should help beginners see these levels at first sight. Part I - Bull cases: SPY Peaked through resistance and held. Common thought was resistance at 394.xx ATH while I drew my resistance line at 392.50 earlier last week. It held above 392.50 Thursday, resistance became support and whaddaya know a sharp bounce at 392.50 Friday intraday, turning green. Opened a new position on that support confirmation. 3/19 400c. If you're interested in learning charts, I recommend taking an actual look at the chart below. \u200b Bull Scenario A: SPY opens red and tests 392.50-393 Monday again, holds and closes above 396. If this plays out, we\u2019re likely see the 400 breach Tuesday intraday. I won\u2019t be spooked by the Monday dip. Might actually add. Bull Scenario B: No repetitive back test. Face ripping rally above 400. Who would think folks will get their stimmy this weekend and the forbidden digital asset will trade above $60K? Honestly guys, this was kinda obvious. Not saying retail is single-handedly causing this. In my opinion, institutions anticipating this move is behind the $60K breach. I bet if we look at today\u2019s buying blocks next week, we will see double digit unit purchases dominating fraction buys. This will be the confirmation of institution involvement, bringing retail inside. Anyway, $60K+, VIX potential $20 break down, QQQ short term bottom(?) and current market momentum pointing SPY 400 Monday. Many more detailed indicators (Bullish MACD cross overs, call/put ratios, percentage of tickers above 200 moving average inside SPY etc.) supporting this but explaining them without a video is not practical. Continuing on scenario B...Test 402 Monday intraday, rejection, test 404 (actual resistance) Tuesday and a sharp rejection. This is where I\u2019m hoping to exit my 400c position and go short term \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b. Monday closing above 400 (or not) will be the deciding factor. VIX Fellas this part is important. Spend some time on the chart below. VIX is very close to the infamous $20 support. Last time that support was tested, bears raped EVERYONE. They took no prisoners. I\u2019d like to point out that last time it was under 20 was more than a year ago. Rules apply. VIX goes up, stocks goes down and vice versa. AKA fear indicator. If VIX goes below 20, which is a big event, Bull Scenario B will apply 100%. QQQ I think we\u2019ve all learned the last 3 weeks that portfolio diversification is a real thing \ud83d\ude43 While QQQ is still sitting at a bear territory, it showed signs of a likely short term bottom. Mighty 323 resistance (double top) and 311 is the VERY important support. I believe it\u2019s going to follow the rest of the crowd, breaking key resistances at 318 and 323. I will be on the look out for 318+ Monday premarket for confirmation. If so, above Bull Scenario A or B likely apply, thus giving bears little to no early hope. TSLA While 700 resistance is obvious, i believe 720 is much more important. In above Bull Scenario A, TSLA tests 688 support, bounces and close above 705. Tuesday tests 720 for real for real and hard rejection. In above Bull Scenario B, pre-market 700+ straight up, taking advantage of pre-market low volume (I believe it did this at 800 as well) and blasts through 720. This level is where I\u2019m hoping to exit my 3/19 700 calls. TNX 10 YEAR TREASURY NOTE YIELD I want to cover this part in another post under bear cases. I think bears gonna love mid next week. I will be shorting financials and oil. If this was informative, let me know and I\u2019ll continue tomorrow holding a big ass bear flag for Part II. EDIT: Thanks for the love guys. So far so good. Let\u2019s get that 400.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-03-14 15:00:18", "id": "m4odqq"}

{"text": "I have a question - hoping for someone much smarter to explain. \u200b Won't these small spikes as we've seen week of Feb-26 and just Today Week of Mar-5 Help Shorts and couldn't they be engineered by shorts as well ? The Thing that really helps with running up the option chain is if there are enough options bought and you force delta hedging especially with a stock like GME. If the price is very stable for a period of time (like after the Jan. Squeeze) for a few weeks, then the price of those options drop and a lot of people were able to buy them. For example, the $115C was something like $1.50 per contract prior to the run-up we had week of Feb-26 and a lot of people were able to profit massively and I'm assuming many used the profits to buy more shares. Good Ape Move. However, after that spike all the contracts going forward became much more expensive as the premiums and volatility went through the roof. This week, I was able to nag $200C for $1.6 and sold some for $8 which was a blessing but it seems to me, a spike or so every week keeps options prices high and thus prevents retailers from being able to afford call options which seems like a bit of a win for Short Sellers. Is this logic sound at all? I'm dumb so any advice is helpful. But I had been waiting all week for premiums to drop on call options so I could afford a few that wasn't So out of the money. If the pattern continues, then leading up to week of Mar-19 and Earnings Mar-26, premiums would get bumped up week after week. Maybe having the price itself stable at incremental steps up week to week far outweighs the options side of things.

A few posters were upset at me collecting positions but my logic is this is knowledge that is likely available to and collected by the short side and thus it is good for everyone here to have the same transparency. \u200b A few things have become obvious from this process 1) Is this is by no means a holistic accounting of these posts. It has become clear to me I am missing a lot. It was pointed out that our admin team purges any yolo below 25k as well users potentially purging their own posts or me just missing them. So this isn't meant to be all encompassing just an interesting insight. \u200b I kept the same slightly unrealistic assumption of 100% of posters having diamond hands. Interestingly of the de duped data only 1 user decreased their position while all the others either kept the same positions or increased it often literally doubling down. \u200b I included users who shared their position in my original post to validate my silent whale theory. (These positions arn't confirmed with a screenshot and I don't 100% trust all of them but oh well.) The Data: Since yesterday I was able to collect an additional 106 positions holding 87,754 shares with a mean holding of 731 shares. This bringing the total number of positions collected to 261 holding 339,958 shares. If we believe the available float is 27M this means only 261 kongs hold 1.25% of all float. Again this isn't all encompassing and doesn't even start to account for the potential millions of other apes holding gme. In my last post I postulated about the ( on the internet and I personally believe this applies in the case of these yolos and reddit in general.

We can make a some what irresponsible estimate At 1:9 2,349 WSB Kongs hold 3,059,622 shares \u200b At 1:90 23,490 WSB Kongs hold 30,596,220 shares. \u200b Again just estimates but this isn't even accounting for god knows how many of the 9.5m WSB apes who hold 1-10 shares or close connections of these apes who arn't even on WSB. No way of knowing for sure but I personally believe retail owns very close to all the float or all of it. If people want the data I pulled anonymized to run further analysis I can share it. TDLR: 261 kongs hold 339,958 share or 1.25% of all float *Gamestops site lists float as 54m so with that number these 261 Kongs own 0.627% of float. Edit: Was pointed out gamestops site lists Float as 54.2M and the other numbers of float 45m, 27m, 19m are likely inaccurate.

I don't really know how to put on paper what I see in this company so I've created a little chart. \u200b As you may be aware, every institution is telling you NIO has failed expectations. That NIO is a not what you though it was and is on Rocky ground. When the truth is they are manipulating the facts like Bobby Axelrod and trying to make money off this stock both ways. I'm here to tell you, that you a being manipulated into believing this company is failing so they can short your money and turn around and buy your shares for cheap. February is always a slow month in China. What is important to note is that February sales have increased 689% over last years sales. Profit for NIO is not great but you have to remember that this company is not very old. Getting this company into Europe 2nd quarter this year is going to take some debt and bold moves. NIO is looking at the bigger picture and building a rock solid foundation on which to grow. The days of overnight riches may be gone on this stock, but that doesn't mean this stock won't make you rich. Just wait till numbers come out later this year with Europe sales included. NIO will sell over 150k cars this year and that will just be the beginning. Don't let institutions get used to beating you out of every hard earned dollar you thought you invested wisely. You have and NIO is still a must have stock in your portfolio.

If this doesn't work, I'll stay where I was at. Send me a message if you see this disappear. Thank you all for your help! I didn't leave WSB on purpose, automod just doesn't like me. Current price: 223.61 12:26 Update GME did break 220 again and has been hanging around 222. We'll see if there's another attack if GME continues to go up. There is a Gamma Squeeze Threshold, but we don't know where that price range is at. If they attack again, it might tell us where the SHITs think that threshold is at. Current price: 224.04 11:31 Update Thank you to everyone for their support. I'm honored to be able to provide content that is worthy to you wrinkle brained Apes. I am trying to find a way to do this for a living. If I can make enough money on GME, I'm going to start an investment firm, hire some smart people to do research and analysis, and share all of that knowledge on Reddit for stocks y'all find interesting. I would continue to do live threads while managing an account for people who want the fun of WSB but don't know what they're doing. I'm currently planning on applying to Harvard so I can share all of their knowledge to you all so that Reddit can continue to become smarter investors. GME has stalled around 217. Though as I'm writing this update, I'm seeing a fast change in trajectory moving up so maybe it's moving? Current price: 218.85 11:08 Update Two small attacks, two small recoveries. They might be using smaller attacks to bring GMEs price down this morning. We may be at the start of a 3rd attack, so don't be surprised by another dip. They still haven't hit the Red yet, so we'll see if they accomplish that now. Current price: 215.96 10:40 Update Another attack. It started at almost the same price point as the other one. They're stratified with the stock been in the green though as they seem to stop before it gets to red. This tells me that they fear the Gamma Squeeze. They seem to be trying to avoid the 230 area. If we get there today, we'll see if that ignites a rocket. Current price: 214.00 10:16 Update We're almost top 25 here! I appreciate all of your support so far. I hope I can prove to be a post worthy to be near the top of this sub. The attack is over and GME bounces back. GME is currently up 6% and seems to have some momentum. If they fire again though, that'll tell us if there's a price point they fear GME crossing. That's probably Gamma Squeeze territory. Current price: 220.96 10:08 Update This isn't a stall, this is a full on attack. SHITs apparently still have ETF shorts to fire. Unless they start driving GME into the Red though, those are just more shorts that need to be bought in \ud83e\udd37. They could be trying to prevent a Gamma squeeze from happening. My dumb stab in the dark guesses that it would take pushing the price up to 250 or 280 to trigger a Gamma Squeeze, but these attacks might signal that that threshold might be a bit closer. I'll look closer and keep y'all updated. Current price: 220.00 10:03 Update GME has stalled for a bit at around 220. Don't be surprised of this happening. The only way we go consistently up is when we hit Gamma Squeeze territory. For now, we have to rely on good old buying power. As shorts get covered, whales jump in, or stimulus checks start pouring in, we'll continue to see moments of growth sporadically throughout the day. Once we hit Gamma Squeeze territory, the engine should ignite. Current price: 219.14 9:41 Update After a beating yesterday, GME comes out swinging out of the gate, flying upwards to 8% . GME is on SSR and they used a lot of shorts through ETFs yesterday, so I don't know how they stop this momentum. If GME can hit a Gamma Squeeze threshold, today could be insane. Where's that threshold? I'm sure there are some wrinkle brains here that can figure that out for me. If y'all can give me the proof, I'll post it here. Current price: 224.47 9:25 Update \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Premarket This might mean a really strong start for GME. Buckle up! Current price: 220.12 8:38 Update WSB auto mod hates me. My post there got removed again, so it looks like I'm hanging out here again today. I'm working on a solution over there and will let you know if I migrate there. I'm sorry I don't have candles or cups for you all. I know the standards here are pretty high, but I'm a smooth brained ape. I just hope that my removal from WSB doesn't cause undue panic. GME is officially green in pre-market. Let's see if this continues into opening bell. Current price: 214.00 8:20 Update I'm making my own post in case this post gets removed in the WSB Megathread. If I can't make things work at WSB, I'll stay here again today. Premarket, GME has stayed steady. I don't see the type of attacks we saw yesterday premarket. That doesn't mean that things won't light up once markets open. Current Price: 203.01 8:03 Update It seems that my posts are still getting auto-deleted. I've removed all links. Please let me know if this posts gets removed again. I'm trying to figure out a solution before the GME Megathread comes online. Current Price: 204.12 7:42 Update New format! This will hopefully be easier to follow. If you want to know where I've been the past 2 days, read below! Updates will now be at the top of the post. I will transition this post to the GME Megathread when it comes up. Premarket shows a slight dip from close yesterday. This doesn't seem to be the same sort of attack at premarket yesterday, but it's still early.

Why weren't you on WSB? I thought I got myself banned from WSB, so I made my comments elsewhere. I wasn't banned, I just had something in my post that forced it to get autoremoved. There is no conspiracy. WSB mods did nothing wrong. They reached out to me and told me they enjoy my comments. I'm just really smooth brained. I'm going to be more careful about what types of links I put in my posts. Wow, you're really smooth brained, but where did you go? My fellow Apes, on Monday, I came to spread the good word, but found that my words were not heard. I figured that my time on WSB was done, so I ventured into other parts of Reddit to find a new home. What I found was a small city of wrinkle brained apes dedicated to GME. Their Daily Megathread recommended that comments like mine be their own separate posts, so I made my own post. Everything was normal, except for my new surroundings. Many of my usual apes were able to find me and I made some new ape friends along the way. I missed being on WSB, but I was content having a home. When I had a chance to check my surroundings, I came to learn just how smooth brained I was. I am used to crayons and bananas, but these apes spoke of candles and cups with handles. Many spoke with words that hurt my small brain, but they all seemed to be convinced that the reckoning was at hand. I spent my time reading and learning, trying to understand GME in a way I never understood before. I am still a smooth brained ape, but I hope that I can share some of the knowledge those wrinkle brained Apes taught me. Corno4825, what did you learn? SHITs can manipulate GME through ETFs. ETFs are essentially stocks that represent a collection of stocks. How this works is that there are people who will buy and sell shares of the stocks that comprise the ETF when someone buys or sells the ETF. The strategy involves shorting the ETF, but buying all of the stocks that comprise the ETF except for GME. The people who manage the ETF will sell the stocks including GME. The net change is that only GME is sold. It's complicated, but I've seen the math and charts and am convinced that this works. That was the attack that we saw yesterday even though GME was on the SSR list. However, that ammunition is also limited and those shorts also have to be bought back in. With the recovery the GME made yesterday following the attack, I believe it is in a much stronger squeeze position strictly because of the amount of shorts that were used that need to be bought back in. There are many wrinkle brained Apes that believe that the total shorts in circulation equal over 200% of the float. There is a lot of math involved which I do not understand, but many other wrinkle brained Apes agreed with the assessment. There was also a post from a Bloomberg Terminal that showed that Institutions by themselves held 115% of Gamestop shares. Corno4825, what does this mean? Millions of shorts still need to be covered. The SHITs are running out of ammo. Stimulus checks still haven't kicked in. Earnings report is coming next week. GME is still up over $150 from where it was 3 weeks ago. If you're still holding on after everything you've experienced the past week, what could possibly scare you now?", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-03-18 02:33:30", "id": "m74eps"}

{"text": "Sorry if my English is not the best. I'm from Germany \ud83e\udd10\ud83e\udd23 A simple Reason why I think we should all go in AMC without nearly any cares about losses and hold it. The Value is very low now and we all know what's going on this time so we have a very huge chance to make a huge amount of money and even if this gamma squeeze won't happen in near future we will win or at least go out without losses. AMC has many Cinemas around the globe and everyone loves going to the cinema. After the Covid-bullshit when they can open again with full capacity, the company can earn money again and has a good chance to grow again in long term and we all can take our money back. Maybe one month, maybe one year, who knows. And please remember the rumors about the corporations with Amazon and Netflix. That's why I use every penny I can get to buy and hold AMC until we reach the Andromeda Galaxy. But that's NOW. If Monday everybody starts to think like this and buy before the price reaches unrealistic dimensions to get it back, it can be a little more struggle psychologically. I will use the low price at this time to build out my position and enjoy this ride into the core of singularity like I've seen in the Interstellar movie.

{"text": "Ocugen profit potential I thought I\u2019d put together some rough estimates of what Ocugen could make here. It\u2019s a bit wordy but bare with me here and let\u2019s establish some facts first: - Ocugen is marketed as 2 doses. - Ocugen can only sell Covaxin in US market - Covaxin is being sold at a 40-50% profit margin at a cost price of $3-4 in India, we\u2019ll use 40% at $3 which gives us a cost price of $1.80 and a profit margin of $1.20 per dose as a minimum. - Ocugen keep 45% of all profits, this means at $1.20 margin per dose, Ocugen would keep $0.56 profit per dose at $3 selling price. It\u2019ll likely be higher than this in the US market, up to $9 would still be cheaper than J&J who are selling at $10 per dose. - Ocugen could make $0.54 - $1.62 per dose if they sell at $3 - 9 - Covaxin unlikely to beat Pfizer/J&J for market share but could do very well in child vaccine space as it may be the first approved for children. Conservative sales scenario: Covaxin pick up 10% of the market in adult sales, which would be around 21M people at 2 doses each = 42M doses. Making $0.54 - $1.62 per dose each would mean $22 - 66M for adult market. Covaxin should do much better in child vaccines, 30% market share could be easily achieved, that\u2019s also around 21M children at $0.54 - $1.62 per dose Another $22 - 66M for child market. Putting the conservative figures at $44 - 132m assuming 10% adult and 30% child market share for COVAXIN. A best case scenario: Covaxin could also do significantly better if it\u2019s pricing itself aggressively and shown to be good against variants. It could pick up 30% adult market share and 60% child market share at a best case scenario That would mean $66 - 200M for adult market and a $44 - 130M child market. Bringing the best case scenario to $110 - $330M in profits. That gives it a big range of $44M in profits in a conservative scenario and $330M in a best case. This would likely be yearly, as vaccines will be needed for some time.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-03-04 22:40:19", "id": "lxjl3g"}

{"text": "Will cross post to r/bb_stock. I'm the one that originally posted BB DD back in November a week prior to aws announcement, in that thread, I predicted a eoy pt of 12-18, I still stand by that. 215m rev, expected 245. BB's downfall has always been lack of revenue growth, and the reaction matched the results. However let's dig a bit deeper. They said that they're currently in the process of selling a large portfolio of messaging and communication patent profile, to a north american buyer And hence under that stipulation, they stated that they were unable to generate revenue using those patents. That explains why they missed. 2. I did not expect a settlement from Facebook, however I do think this buyer could be Facebook, it would make sense if you look at the lawsuits that occurred between Facebook and BB, one of them was the ability to switch from having games inlay in a messenger ( FB messenger) which BB won. 3. Expecting 9-15% GAAP growth in cyber sec, yes this isn't as much growth as CRWD but BB is worth 4-5b vs 40b for crwd. They mentioned USPS, looking forward to more details about that. Notes: I think even the fact they mentioned the patent sale on ER would indicate that they're in very advanced talks, or they would lose their negotiating power. The patent was said to be a lump payment + tail of multiple years which is amazing. Ivy partnerships will be announced later this year and be in cars by 2022, I already predicted this but a confirmation is nice. Overall this quarter also saw one less competitor in McAfee They're also putting more of an initiative in marketing and brand awareness. They have 800m in cash, 800-900m in revenue, valued at 4-6b. With potential for explosion via IVY and more cyber sec growth in the coming years. I think there will be more negativity to come, especially from analysts that will want to flaunt their previous price targets, they will double down on that. I think this will present a nice buying opportunities for anyone that wants in the coming days.

{"text": "This is not financial advice. I\u2019m not your financial advisor. Greetings fellow autists, Firstly, I\u2019d like to say how proud I am to be a part of this community. I\u2019ve been a redditor for almost a decade and this is by far the best group of apes I\u2019ve ever had the privilege of calling my brothers and sisters. I truly care about each and every one of you. I\u2019ve put a ridiculous amount of time in trying to determine how to personally navigate this journey and I\u2019d like to share my findings with you. Briefly about me: I have an educational and corporate background in applied mathematics and engineering. I am not a financial markets expert; however, I have a good amount of faith in my ability to analyze, understand, and manage risk. Hopefully some of you find this to be helpful. There are a two points that I\u2019d like to address: 1. How I got comfortable with my plays. 2. The effects of good intentioned, but ultimately poor analysis. How I got comfortable with my plays: Firstly, let\u2019s make this clear: I am not wearing my investor\u2019s hat right now. I\u2019m not diversifying or hedging in any way. This is a calculated bet for me. I think the risk is worth the potential rewards. This is the opportunity of a lifetime; however, nothing is guaranteed and even if the MOASS were guaranteed, none of us know exactly when it will happen. If I put money in that I could not afford to lose, I damn near guarantee that I would paper hands. This would not only hurt my fellow apes, but it would also hurt me. It\u2019s a lot easier to diamond hands, or even just profit, when you\u2019re truly fully prepared to lose everything that you put on the table. It\u2019s cliche, but scared money doesn\u2019t make money... I figured out an amount of money that could result in life changing gains, but that I\u2019ll be okay with losing if things don\u2019t pan out as I expect them. Next step, how do I allocate that money? Stocks vs call options. My greedy side wanted to yolo the vast majority of my bet into deep out of the money call options. My conservative side told me that I don\u2019t really know when this rocket takes off, so I should be a bit careful. The beauty in the stock is that I can sell it whenever I want. The beauty in the options is their leverage. I don\u2019t want to get into the nuances of purchasing/evaluating options as that can be a series of posts on its own, but this is a fairly high level look at what I did: I ended up putting approximately 50% of my bet into stocks. I didn\u2019t do this all at once, but spread my stock purchases out over a few week period. I purchased a few options already near the money with expiration dates a month or so out (plot spoiler, they\u2019re very much in the money now). This gave me some time to see how things would develop and the ability to exercise them instead of just closing for a profit. I also acquired options fairly far out of the money, with later expiration dates. These comprise a small percentage of my investment \\~ 10% or so, but also allow me to greatly capitalize if the rocket goes boom within my timeframe. Finally I left a bit of money to continue with option (or stock) plays if this journey goes on for longer than initially expected. Obviously we don\u2019t all have the purchasing power to execute this sort of strategy, but hopefully some of it still applies to everyone. The effects of good intentioned, but ultimately poor analysis: I\u2019m not talking about engineered FUD. I usually just laugh at that shit and move on. That doesn\u2019t phase me at all, if anything it strengthens my resolve. What does bother me are posts that are positive and ostensibly sound, but fundamentally lacking in trustworth data and analysis. I\u2019ve seen a ton of posts with data/conclusions that are flat out incorrect, i.e. misconstruing short volume and short interest, not realizing that the data isn\u2019t up to date, using data without understand the mechanisms behind it, etc. As an example, when discussing the amount of shares left to short from iborrowdesk, no one seems to talk about what that actually means. When/how are those shares replenished (meaning if there are only 150,000 shares left today, what does that actually mean for tomorrow or the next day)? How long do the borrowers have to use said shares? You get the point. There are also posts using financial indicators or other metrics/features, comparing time series of graphs, etc. Many of them draw conclusions that are just not correct. There are so many different indicators/features and they do tell part of the story, but far from everything and especially not when used in isolation. Accurately modeling financial data is difficult. That doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t think people should do it. We should definitely do it, but we need to not only understand how to use these tools but also what they can tell us, if anything, and how to effectively communicate our findings to an audience with very different levels of experience. It\u2019s like this: You work in construction. You go onto a forum and see people talking about building houses. Someone is like look: \u201cHere\u2019s a screwdriver, hammer, etc\u201d this house will be easy to build. You\u2019d think that sounded ridiculous, right? That\u2019s how a lot of these posts sound. Being excited is awesome, and believe me I\u2019m fucking excited, but these posts are misleading a lot of people. For people with little to no knowledge, they may be misled into making poor decisions. For people in the know, they\u2019re probably thinking: \u201cwtf are these retards talking about?\u201d Both can ultimately lead people to lose their faith, and that is a very bad outcome. tl;dr Have a fucking plan. Think with your greedy and conservative hats. Be extremely careful in giving credence to posts that say: \u201cX will happen on Y date.\u201d DD posters: please, please, please do your fucking due diligence. Question everything that you write. Imagine that you are pitching a strategy to a bunch of really smart and nit-picky people that will question everything you say. Break down everything. Explore the nuances and tradeoffs at each point of your hypothesis, analysis, and conclusions. With that being said, I want to end this on a positive note. I\u2019m super fucking bullish on GME.

That makes them bigger than Russia, Spain, Australia, Mexico, Indonesia, Netherlands, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Poland, Taiwan, Sweden, Belgium, Thailand, Argentina, Nigeria, Iran... you get the point [ They also have the 7th largest e-commerce market in the world. [ It is also the ultimate turnaround story. Up until the mid-1900s, they were a third-world Japanese colony, but in 2021 it is a first world country with one of the largest economies in the world. And they did this in about 40 years with their focus on tech and industrials as well as entertainment. Samsung, Hyundai, Kia, LG, KPop... (KPop is an international sensation right now - $564M export reported Aug 2020 last year and growing). [ Also, just know how advanced they are technologically. They have had RFID chips a decade before us. They've had 5G for years. They have the best e-sports gamers in the world. They are no stranger to the worldwide web. A big reason why they are so successful is because they are 2nd in the world in how much of their national GDP they spend on R&D. [ \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GETTING BACK TO COUPANG \\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $CPNG is only cash flow negative right now because they invested 100s of millions of dollars into their infrastructure allowing them to have 70% of South Korea's population (36 million / 51 million) within 7 miles of their distribution centers. They can only do this because 50% of South Korea's population lives in the Seoul metropolitan area. Yes, 50 fucking percent. 25 million people. That's like 3 New York Cities side-by-side. [ South Korea's annual online sales is $37 billion and e-commerce sales of total retail sales 9.8%. [ $CPNG sales went from $6B in 2019 to $12B in 2020 (92% growth) [ They also increased their market share from 18% in 2019 to 24% in 2020 (33% growth) [ . . . So, if the South Korean e-commerce market grows at a 22.4%, it will be $142B by 2024. [ \\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- RISKS & REBUTTALS \\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- They sell mostly their own products - OK they've got strong customer loyalty. Can they expand their business to incorporate more 3rd party sellers in the future? Potential is there. Low gross profit margin - Retail has always historically been a low profit margin business. Is it possible for them to introduce a new high margin product or service? Absolutely. Still cash flow negative - Did you see the revenue growth? $6B to $12B in one year. They're a growth company in its early stages. I also mentioned above how they're investing 100s of millions into their infrastructure (distribution centers within 7 miles of 70% of population). They don't have AWS - It's not a literal copy of Amazon. They are also growing their e-commerce business before focusing on anything else. Sales went from $6B to $12B in one year. They need to saturate this market before focusing on anything else. It's highly likely they will introduce new high profit product or service in the coming years. Their founder is a Harvard drop out. They dominate only in South Korea - What's wrong with that? Even with the South Korean e-commerce market alone, $CPNG can become a $500B company. They are focused on dominating their immediate market. I'm sure they'll create new services and create new sources of revenue. Once the Korean market is saturated, they'll figure out a way to expand. These South Koreans are smart and good at tech. Don't underestimate them. \\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- VALUATION - PRICE TARGET \\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If in 2024, $CPNG has a 40% market share, they will have $57B in sales (Amazon has 37% market share of US in 2020). With a conservative P/S of 4, that puts $CPNG FAIR VALUE at $133 PER SHARE ($57B sales x 4 = $228B valuation). If they are doing well and they have hype, with a P/S of 6 (BABA has 6, CPANG has 7), then $CPNG should be $200 PER SHARE ($57B x 6 = $342B valuation). And this is if they DON'T CREATE ANY NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. Think about that. No new products or services. Just purely their e-commerce business and it's still going to be worth $150-200 PER SHARE. If they launch an AWS-like thing or maybe another service that's just waiting to be discovered, they're going to do an additional $10B easy with the market share they have so add another $50 to the price targets. As one of the technologically most advanced countries in the world, $CPNG is not here to stay. It's here. To takeover (South Korea). \\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CONCLUSION \\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My thesis is heavily dependent on them expanding their business with new high margin products/services, but this is a bet I am willing to make (one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world, Softbank, Blackrock, Bill Ackman, Harvard drop out, etc.). I guarantee they will innovate. Oh and even if it's not them developing something internally, they can always acquire a company. They're going to do billions in profits soon. That is a lot of money. It's under $50 today. With an $87B valuation. It's literally free money.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-03-15 02:50:45", "id": "m4yrl3"}
{"text": "Preface: GME Apes hold on to GME with your diamond hands, this is not a ploy to get you to sell nor is this post for you. This entertainment, not financial advice. This is just a \ud83c\udff3\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b look into the bond market and why you are seeing red and will continue to. TLDR first so anyone interested in taking a trip into the bearcave and coming out the closet on the other side can understand what's happening. TL,DR: The fed is no longer in control of interest rates. Stocks are artificially inflated due to the Fed injecting money into the economy with nowhere for it to go but to investments, with stocks offering the highest returns of all possible investments. This used to not be an issue as the Fed was in control of how much QE could be done through open market operations as they were the buyers, but as the money supply is now enormous coupled with rising money velocity, the Fed will now have no choice but to start the process of QT, but to do that they need to sell bonds, which they are struggling to do due to low interest rates. To sell more bonds to reduce the money supply they will have to increase interest rates, resulting in a sea of red and the\ud83c\udff3\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b's taking a trip to tendietown. Part 1: Macro 101 review: If you are comfortable with macroeconomic concepts, feel free to skip this part. This section is just definitions for the retards on the short bus that flunked out of econ. For this DD we will need to understand the concepts of money supply, money velocity, open market operations, QE, and QT. Money supply is the total amount of money in the economy. Money velocity tells us how fast money is changing hands through the economy. More info at and [ Open market operations refers to the Fed purchasing or selling securities on the open market, which is one of three monetary tools the Fed has at its disposal, with the other two being the discount rate and reserve requirement which are not important for this DD. QE and QT refer to quantitative easing/tightening, which is where the fed performs open market operations to either increase or decrease the supply of money in the economy. Part 2: What's been happening so far: Now that we have let the retards off the short bus, lets discuss where we are right now at a macroeconomic scale and how we got here. I want to get to what is happening with the bonds and I will try to keep this as short as possible. As we all know, the Fed has been printing money like crazy since last year, with JPow money machine go brrrr. As a result, the money supply has gone through the roof since the pandemic hit, which we can see below in the M2 graph: \u200b [M2 money supply becomes the hot new club. Right now, yields have nowhere to go but up, and the fed has no choice but to increase them, thereby tanking the market, which we will see next. As the money velocity increases as the economy opens back up, the amount of total money flowing around will increase as the same dollar will move faster through the economy, artificially inflating it. If we keep the money supply the same as it is now while increasing the money velocity, we will have a serious problem on our hands. This is because the value of the economy as a whole has not increased, so more money will represent the same pool of goods, causing an extreme amount of inflation. The money printer was good when the economy was shut down and saved our asses from a great depression part 2, electric boogaloo, but will cause inflation unless the money supply is reduced as money velocity increases. The fed knows this, and are currently in the process of issuing new debt in the form of bonds: [ This is quantitative tightening in action, with the fed now performing open market operations to reduce the money supply to prevent all that money from flooding and tanking the economy. But there is a problem that the Fed is currently facing, which is that nobody wants bonds that have shit interest rates. To get people to buy their bonds, they have no choice but to raise interest rates. Time is also ticking, as the economy is reopening and the money velocity is increasing as can be seen in the FRED money velocity graph, meaning that if the fed doesn't raise rates, inflation will become a problem very quickly, and they will have to sharply increase rates or the entire US economy will be extremely fucked. As a side note the ratio of increase is higher in M1 than M2, which could potentially exaggerate damage to consumers. Unfortunately for the stock market, but fortunately for the \ud83c\udff3\u200d\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b's who have not been hunted to extinction, as bond yields increase, money will flow from the stock market to other securities as well as back into the general economy, reducing the total funds in the stock market, causing it to crash. Part 4: My (Dance) Moves: Phew. That was long. Unfortunately, as of the writing of this post, it looks like higher interest rates could be around the corner at any time, and the higher they get the harder the market will drop as money flows from stocks to bonds and other less risky securities. To take advantage of this I plan to exit some long positions and swap them for cash as well as shares and calls on inverse market positions such as UVXY, SQQQ, and SPXS. Again this is not financial advice, and if you buy stocks that people mention on the internet without properly researching them first, you are actually retarded. \u200b \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edit: (not financial advice) Hi everybody. It looks like my post gained some traction last night. As a thank you to those who have read and commented, I will address some of the questions and points people are having in this edit so they are visible to all. One of the more common questions/points is that the fed just won't allow rates to raise because they don't want it to. Again like it says in the DD, at this time I do not believe the Fed is in control of the interest rates, and will quickly have no choice in the matter, no matter what daddy JPow says they will do. It may not happen today or this week, but it is coming. As money velocity goes up with the same amount of money in the system due to economic reopening, inflation takes off like a bat out of hell. If inflation goes up, the US dollar becomes less valuable, and if it goes up too much, the US Gov't will have exciting new problems to deal with. To reduce the money supply through QT the only real tool that the government has is open market operations to sell securities on the open market to reduce money supply, meaning that they need to sell bonds, which will require higher interest rates because they just aren't selling with the shit rates they are at now. The rates must increase to prevent widespread economic pain. Another question is that why hold cash if there is inflation? Won't I lose money? That may be true that your money will become less valuable if inflation takes hold, but you will have much less of it if you HODL during a crash or try to time the market. OK, now that some questions have been answered, bonus round: First lets talk about why the market crashes when funds flow out. The best way to think about the total market price at a macroeconomic level is through supply and demand. If we say that the supply is the total number of stonks in the market and demand is the amount of money in the market, we can see that generally the total money flowing in or out of the market is what determines market value, as the supply of stocks for sale is not changing a lot on a day to day basis across an index or a market. Another thing to realize is that the Fed is between a rock and a hard place if you think about it. No matter what they do, there will be pain and someone will end up getting kneecapped holding bags. Loaning out money to get people to buy bonds looks bad, as it looks like a government scheme to con people into buy worthless bonds. Capping bond rates will kneecap and effectively nationalize the bond market, potentially sending shocks through the system. Do nothing and inflation fucks everything. Raise rates and the market gets flushed down the toilet. Rates are also so low they can't be decreased further. Finally, no matter what happens in the market, UVXY, SQQQ, and SPXS are currently at rock bottom prices. There is little room for them to shrink, but an enormous amount of room for them to grow. Once again, thanks everybody and this is not financial advice. \u200b \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- JPow Interview and bond activity update: (as of 3/4/21, 4:00 PM) Interview sauce: [ US 10 year bond yield rates: [ \u200b Ok, this will be the last update on this DD before I let it ride and see what happens. After watching the JPow Jobs Summit interview, there are three things to take away, with the first two relevant and the third being very important. First is that at (3:55), Powell mentions that as spending surges due to reopening, the Fed will be expecting excess inflation. This is largely in line with and provides some evidence for my claim that as the money velocity increases, we will have inflation due to the money supply not contracting enough to prevent inflation. The second is that for now, until the fed sees its goals met, i.e. max employment and price stability, or until inflation becomes a problem, the Fed will continue its policy of QE (timestamps 9:55 & 18:55). This will continue to inject money into the economy, so no big surprise there, but do keep in mind that this money printing will need to be continually managed through selling treasury securities back on the open market, so if there continues to be trouble in the bond market, that may potentially have an effect on the current QE being undertaken. The first two things are not surprising, but the third big takeaway is quite important, which is that the Fed is prepared to combat excessive inflation by raising rates. At (13:50), Powell was asked about the market sentiment that the Fed will raise rates earlier than expected. His response was that the Fed will not raise rates unless the labor market is at full employment or if inflation becomes excessive. As of now, inflation is around 1.5%, and the fed has a target of 2%. Powell mentioned many times that they are okay with inflation being a bit over that as long as it is transitory, but at (24:30) Powell also said that the Fed will not let inflation get out of control, and was very adamant about that. The third takeaway is important as when coupled with the the fact that the rising money velocity will increase inflation as well as the fact that the US Gov't is struggling to unload bonds, it seems to suggest that the Fed will soon indeed have no choice but to raise rates to prevent excessive inflation due to the large money supply coupled with increasing money velocity. The sentiment in the bond market seems to agree, with the 10 year treasury yield up by 8 basis points today to 1.564%. This is also good evidence for my thesis that money from the stock market will rotate out into bonds and other investments as yields have no choice but to improve, and again today has been another bloodbath in the stock market. If this continues I would fully expect to see more money rotate out of stocks, further crashing the stock market. See y'all at my new favorite club, The Bearcave(TM).

{"text": "I don\u2019t want to waste anyone\u2019s time, so if you\u2019re only trading with the remains of your stimulus check, close this post now. Sorry, you just don\u2019t have the proper capital to play. Ideally, you need at least $2k for this strategy to be worth your time. Now that we got that out of the way, let\u2019s dive in! The first thing you need to do is learn how to use the Poor Man\u2019s Covered Call (PMCC) strategy. PMCCs are a leveraged version of traditional CCs. All you do is buy LEAPS and sell short dated calls against it. We use LEAPS because they mimic 100 shares of a stock and you can usually get them 30-50% cheaper than buying 100 shares. You leverage junkies should really like that. Next, pick your favorite meme stock and start your PMCC. This alone is a highly profitable strategy because meme stocks have high IVs, so you\u2019ll be collecting a lot of premium on the calls you sell. Don\u2019t get overly excited yet, you\u2019re not going to become a millionaire from doing this alone. There\u2019s still one more step. I know, I\u2019m putting too much stress on your small attention span. It\u2019s okay though, we are on the final step. Once you have a decent amount of cash built up from the premium you\u2019ve been collecting, you can either open up another PMCC on the meme stock you\u2019re currently using, or open a PMCC for another meme stock. If you\u2019ve done this properly, you\u2019ve now doubled your premium intake. You just keep doing this strategy over and over again, letting your portfolio get loaded with the latest meme stocks. Before you know it, you\u2019ll have a piece of every meme stock! If your brain at least half functions, I\u2019m sure you can see how this strategy is so powerful. You get to build a massive portfolio full of meme stocks ready to moon for free! All of your new meme stocks are paid for by previously purchased meme stocks. On top of that, you have a steady and ever increasing stream of cash flowing in from premium. Go ahead and tell your wife\u2019s boyfriend all about it. Prove to him that you\u2019re the smartest autist around. Edit: Please ignore the comments from LanoLikesTheStock. The user spewed a ton of false information about the strategy due to his/her lack of understanding. I provided a link to a YouTube video somewhere in that comment thread that gives a proper explanation of the PMCC strategy.

{"text": "Disclaimer, the following doesn't have anything to do with short squeezes, gamma squeezes, or fucking \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b's. I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advice. This is purely my opinion. If you invest based on what I say alone, you are definitely retarded. If you have been following weed investing, you will notice that despite superior earnings and performance, US cannabis trades for less and in relatively low volume. As of right now they cannot trade on any major exchange only OTC. If what the CEO said in a recent report is correct, this may change very soon. Curaleaf ($CURLF) just crushed quarterly earnings and as far as I can tell, no other company is even close; Total Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was a record $230.3 million, an increase of 205.1% compared to $75.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Total Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased 26.2% sequentially. (SOURCE)( This is mostly because of their thirsty executive team re-investing their profits to expand to every state possible in the US. They also just recently announced a European acquisition making them only one of 2 companies legally selling in the two largest markets in the world with ambitions of also opening up in Africa as well. (SOURCE)( They are already the biggest company in the US, will soon be the biggest in the world. One of the other issues facing the US industry as a whole is banking. Because weed is still illegal, most companies have a hard time renting or purchasing spaces. If the owner of the building has a mortgage with Wells Fargo or JP Morgan, the building is basically unavailable. This is why cannabis REITS have been crushing it this year. The Senate Majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has recently rekindled the idea about passing the SAFE act. This would allow these companies to use major banks if they are in legal states. Besides the fact that this would enhance their ability to set up shop around the US, think about what this could mean for companies looking to go global like Curaleaf. I don't know if legalization is around the corner, but frankly I don't care. Regardless of what government does, Curaleaf is going to find a way to move their product around the world and own the market. If the government does move towards legalization, moving onto any US based cannabis company will be a good play. Positions: 5,000 Shares $CURLF, 1,000 Shares GME, 10 19 MAR @ $165 call GME, 500 PYPL, 10 JAN 23 @ $17 call SQQQ, 200 Shares VOO EDIT 1: Some have pointed out $MSOS which is an ETF and you can trade options on. I haven't fully looked into them but I think that any US based cannabis play is good. My analysis up top I think points out why US based cannabis has a higher potential for explosive growth and a lot of the comments point it out as well. EDIT 2: $MO (Altria/Phillip Morris) owns logistics in this space and they already sell tabacco through multiple delivery methods. They are traded on the NYSE already and have a solid stock buy back and good dividends. If legalization gets to the point were it can be sold in gas stations, think of the return. MO has a bigger market cap than any other company but ORTEX gives them a lower PE and EPS ( $MO EPS 2.40 P/E 10.21; $CURLF ($CURA on CSE) P/E 210.98 EPS 25.97) and my guess is because of debt and the lawsuits they will be paying out until time ends. Analyst return recommendations on Ortex also have a higher 12 month return potential for CURLF/CURA (%25 vs. %2.9). With that being said, MO is not selling weed to scale but when they do the growth can be explosive. My one year play is still $CURLF but I will be hedging with $MO. I think $MO is the superior long play especially if they get out of debt.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-03-12 11:36:13", "id": "m36ce0"}

Don't look at my post history unless you need proof I'm retarded I've dumbed down my beliefs to 2 core reasons Their Monetization Model is insane, you have a better chance winning at the casino than you do betting on SKLZ games. On average, players have nearly a 7% statistical edge going to the casino and playing black or red on roulette like a smooth brained dummy fuck (This is literally my favorite way to play roulette so I know what I'm talking about) Let me break it down further, going off of the fact that they take 14% of all bets on average(You'll have a hard time finding this on their site - [ \\- but this Bloomberg article mentions the 14% fee [ So let's say you want to make 10 bets on a SKLZ game. You bet $50 on each game, and so does your opponent. The matchmaking system knows to put you with players of similar skill so unsurprisingly, the 10 game streak ends in a 5-5 draw. Both players will have lost $70 in this situation. If the streak went 6-4 in your favor, you would have earn a measly $16 dollars. SKLZ appears to only want to increase this percentage. I refuse to believe this pricing model will have an appeal to mainstream audiences when they see how hard players are getting boned. Where does Apple's 30% take of In-App purchases fit in? Of this 14% taken from each betting transaction, what is Apple getting from the cut? I am having trouble finding any evidence that apple is making money from these bets that are taking place on their platform. I have reason to believe that SKLZ may be bypassing Apple's 30% fee, as 14% is clearly less than 30%. SKLZ apps allow you to put money into an account without going through the app store. Fortnite got banned from the app store for doing exactly this. If games using the SKLZ plugin get banned from the app store, this company will lose all revenue it earns from the App Store. What would this scenario mean for the stock being that it's currently valued around $10 billion dollars as a hyper growth company that doesn't seem to have apps on any other platform? In the event Apple is getting a cut, how much are they getting? What kind of special treatment is SKLZ getting from Apple? We need to hear from Apple about this companies monetization model.

{"text": "Welcome back Apes. (upvote, comment so everyone sees Apedate!) We have seen some rising volatility the last days, which we love. But there is one very interesting fact. Fact 1: Last Friday the GME amp;amp;amp;amp; AMC stocks formed a new dip, which all of us apes bought instantly. Do you remember the time the shittingers started dipping and halting the stocks? No ... WELL I DO! It was excactly 12:20 when the shitters shitstorm started shitting. Fact 2: Yesterday was the same thing going on. Shitters formed an new bottom dip, for us to buy, and we love them because of that \u2764\ufe0f. The interesting thing here is, that the shitting and dipping and halting started at 12:20! Conclusion: WHAT AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE?! Yeahh... not excatly. We would like to call it here shitter\u2019s market manipulation. SSR has been triggered for the last trading days, which helped us to form an strong support at 13$. Anyway let\u2019s start with the premarket update Pre market Update 09:02: Germany is proudly hodling the support line which has formed the last few days between 13.10$-13.40$. We shall aid them in 28 Minutes when the stock exhange officialy opens. Stocks available to short: 650.000 Current Stock Price: 13.46$ Update 09:31: Stock opens with 13.45$ and instanlt plumets down to 13.3$. We will have to fight at the support Line until we get some buying power rolling. Stocks available to short: 650.000 (unchanged) Current Price: 13.35$ Stocks available to short dropped from 1,100,000 to 650.000 which explains the dip. Buy the dip apes! Update 10:02: Them Shitters used around 50.000 short stocks, that\u2019s why we see our resistance getting tested all the time. We should be up abd running in the next 1-2 Hours. 14$ isn\u2019t far away until than. Update 10:10: We touched 12.50$ and jumped right back to our support at 13$, I\u2019m sure we have quite few diamond hands holding there, good job. Anyway we had some massive volume at starting 30 Minutes, around 1 Million! The way back to 14$ shouldn\u2019t be too hard with all those stimulus checks incoming, I guess! Buy the FKN DIP until it ain\u2019t too late! Current Price: 13$ Shares available to borrow: 750.000 Update 11:03: The dip stopped dipping. Last chance to buy some stonks. No seriously, we shall see some upward movement from here (12.74$). AMC is very likely gonna follow GME (which madd +10% in like 10 Minutes \ud83d\ude80). Anyway there is also bad news which actually is good news: The shitters have topped up their \u201cborrowable-shares\u201d it\u2019s sitting right now at 4.600.000 !!!! ... They could short the fuck out of us now and i would Love if that happens, because than .... THAN THEY WILL LOSE EVEN MORE MONEY once the \ud83d\ude80 starts off to the \ud83c\udf1a Stocks available to Short: 4.600.000 Current stock price: 12.94$ Update 11:12: Im gonna predict something. Today at exactly some seconds before 12:20, we will see a massive Stonk Sell-Off from the Shitters, they will try and implement fear into us, but they won\u2019t succeed. Stocks available to Short: 4.600.000 Current price: 13.13$ amp;amp;amp;lt;\u2014 is the stock price trying to tell us something? ... 13k13 which means 13.130!!! Update 12:03 1.5 Million NEW shorts available which means there are now 6.100.000 Shorts available to the HFuckers. Wow, that\u2019s gonna be a bloodbath in some days, be ready for Impact any day and show them what diamond hands are made from. Our support line moves diagonally down which means, it is not anymore at 13, but moved rather down to 12.4-12.6$. As long as we dont lose that Support today we should see some upward movement ... if HFuckers dont manipulate the market at 12:20 like yesterday. Currently available shorts: 6.100.000 ... seriously. Current Price: 12.69 (well ... at this point you should tell your wifes boyfriend that amc said its 69 time) Update 12:08 The short borrowing Fee has massively decreased. It was 3 working days ago at 8%, now it is sitting at 1.8%. This is only embracing the fact that they are scared from our diamond hands and are preparing the next market manipulation. Update 12:20 HedgieFuzzers have decided to not launch they\u2019re massive attack Today. They are probably stocking their positions up. But i\u2019m sure we will see the attack in the next days (Before we can see again daily profits of 30-50%) Shorts available: 6.100.000 Current price: 12.50$ Update 12:21 What is interesting here is, is the stock dynamic which upped the AMC price from 12.5$ up to 12.75 in under 2 Minutes. Shorts available: 6.100.000 ... Fee changed from 1.8% to 1.7% Current Price: 12.75 Update 13:01 AMC is slowly refuelling it\u2019s motors and starting to scratch at 12.83 resistance. If we get rejected from this resistance , than an double top scenario could occur, which would push the price as low as to 12.50 (where also our support is). Time will tell. Besides that not much has happened. Shorts available: 6.100.000 Current price: 12.8$ Update 13:05 It seems that we will break the 12.83$ resistance. Keep up diamond habds and buy the dip! We also have an inversed head & shoulders to assist us in the push to 13$. Update 13:55 We have barricaded ourselves at 13$ and aren\u2019t planning on giving that mark away to the hedgies! The next mark is around 13.6-14$. Anyway i have discovered something very mysterious. The available short stocks has decreased by 100.000. From 6.1mil to 6.0mil. Apes, all of you know what that means ... \\apes nodding their head\\ ... and if not ill tell you ... \\apes breathe eases\\. This means the HedgeFuckers are preparing to decrease the stock price again, with my prediction being an mix between closing long positions and short attacking (SSR is enabled so this won\u2019t be very successfull, unless they manipulate the market again.). We should see attacks dropping the amc stock, when it starts scratching 14.10$. Shorts available currently: 6.000.000 Price Currently: 13.15 Update 14:18 Still very quiet. Amc is preparing for the fight with resistance at 13.5-13.6$, once we break it we shall have a smooth ride to 14$. Shorts available: 6.1mil Current Price: 13.3$ Update 14:30 Shitters are making their moves again. See how the stock dropped 0.40$ unnormaly while being in an natural up movement supported by double buttom + inversed head ans shoulders and some \ud83e\udd8d Ape checks (stimulus). We should drop im the next minutes to 12.8$-12.9$ before our rocket refules for taking on the 14$ mark. Shorts available: 6.1mil Price: 13.02$ Update: 14:52 Apparently we have failed the double bottom + inversed head and shoulders climb. But domething even better is coming up: rising wedge and the 5th leg are those 12.8$ where we are hovering right now. The 6th leg could catapult us to 14$! Current Price: hovering at 12.8$ and building up 5th leg Update 14:57 Quick uodate on shorts available. The shitteres decreased available shorts by 200.000! Watch out for some massive barrier at 14$ or maybe even at 13.4$ Did they allready use those 200.000 shorts? Probably not, but they reserved them so to say. Update Hoodie So i have been trying to guess some coupon codes on that shop below and it seems as they have made an Easter egg with the hidden code: diamondhands It will give you an discount if you order something Don\u2019t believe me? Go and try it \ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\ude80 Warning: I hope my boss doesn\u2019t ask me why i am taking regular shits every 1 hour ... \ud83d\ude80 And I\u2019m making an giveaway for BUY THE FKN DIP!* ...

Old boomers wanna have a good time, gay couples want to see the Caribbean, middle class America want to go somewhere warm and fun but still close to the beach. You guys know where this is going. Cruise Lines are gearing up for pent up DEMAND. I say we got 3 months before s h t f. reservations are up, dates have been changed but still within the regular holiday season. Last updated March 2. Virgin Voyages has suspended all sailings on its first ship, the Scarlet Lady, through June 30. The ship had been scheduled to sail May 9 from Miami. The Valiant Lady, the line's second ship, will launch from Miami on Nov. 14. Carnival Cruise Line extended its operations pause from U.S. ports through May 31. It canceled European itineraries for the Carnival Legend, which were to operate from May October, and moved the launch date for the Mardi Gras from Port Canaveral, Fla., to May 29.

Departures on the Queen Victoria are still scheduled to resume May 17. Disney Cruise Line extended its operations pause through May. The line canceled sailings on the Disney Dream until June 5, the Disney Wonder through July 8, the Disney Fantasy until August, and, citing the likelihood that international borders will remain closed \"for an extended period of time,\" canceled Europe sailings on the Disney Magic through Aug. 10. The line also canceled many scheduled sailings through July that are longer than seven days. Holland America Line extended its operations pause for all departures through April 30, including Alaska, Mexican Riviera, Pacific coast, Caribbean, Mediterranean and Canada/New England departures. The cancellations include Alaska cruises on the Koningsdam through mid-May and the Eurodam, Oosterdam and Zuiderdam through early June; the Mediterranean through early June on the Volendam and the Westerdam; and the Zaandam's Canada/New England itineraries through August. Holland America Line canceled cruises of eight days or longer that call in the U.S. through Nov. 1, as well as some longer cruises in other parts of the world through mid-April.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. extended the suspension of cruising on its three brands, Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands through May 31. Princess Cruises suspended cruises through May 14 on sailings in the Caribbean, the California coast, early Alaska sailings and Europe cruises, and canceled through November all itineraries that touch U.S. ports and are more than seven days. The line also canceled all cruises in and out of Japan through June 25, citing uncertainty around travel restrictions. Ponant will resume sailing in New Zealand waters for locals only in February.

( ( Devoted cruisers are chomping at the bit to return to the seas and rivers. Their options are extremely limited this year, so many of them are making plans to sail in 2021. And so, even despite the coronavirus pandemic, cruise companies and agency networks say bookings for 2021 are rising, giving the industry a much-needed ray of hope for recovery. In business updates in recent weeks, both Royal Caribbean Group and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. said 2021 bookings are \u201cwithin historical ranges.\u201d In fact, NCLH President and CEO Frank Del Rio said he was \u201castonished\u201d by the booking strength. The biggest news of this whole shebang, a couple can go 12 months with 0 yes ZERO revenue and still survive. After recent equity raises, Carnival Corp. and Royal Caribbean Group have enough liquidity to weather up to 12 more months in an essentially zero-revenue scenario, William Blair said in a note.

{"text": "Some other loser was on here trying to hype the common (FNMA and FMCC). I just wanted to drop this in as a reality check for people before they go charging in like idiots and in all likelihood are met with disappointment. I commented this on the first post but thought it may have better reach as it's own standalone post. The other post : I've been following this trade for about 4 years now. I bought in at a bad time and I'm underwater but I still believe in the underlying investment thesis and thus have not sold all the times I've been above water too. I am going to quickly break it down for people: INVESTMENT THESIS: FNMA and FMCC (the companies) basically got taken over by the government, they are massively profitable but all of their money goes to Uncle Fucking Sam, like in perpetuity. This is because in 2012 Uncle Sam saw they were going to be profitable and possibly pay back the original loan they made during the '08 crisis, and they didn't like that, so they just... changed the agreement. :) Seriously, go read the emails that were sent at this time by government officials, read about the meetings they had and the information they were provided. For me, this was clearly robbery and then they lied about it. That being said, the court cases that have been chasing this agreement for years now lost a lot, largely because of the complexity of HERA (the statute that governs the FHFA, the conservator of FNMA and FMCC) and the courts never really looking at the evidence but rather whether or not they even were allowed to. However, plaintiffs had a massive victory in the 5th Circuit Court of appeals, which was then appealed to SCOTUS. You can go listen to the SCOTUS oral argument and we are now waiting their ruling. INVESTMENT VEHICLES: The other post was on the common, this is likely a massive mistake. The jr pfds are likely much better and still have a potential 5x upside at today's prices (a month or so ago I put in another 12k). There are MANY MANY things that need to go right for the common to payout, and the commons basically have zero legal representation at the moment. Pfds have much fewer things that need to go right to get paid and have almost all the heavy hitters behind them. Ackman is the only guy holding commons I believe. WHAT MAY HAPPEN: Right now we are all-in on a SCOTUS ruling in our favor. 5th circuit went our way but all those gains have been sold off. If we win SCOTUS, guess what, if the government doesn't settle we could still be waiting 2-3 years for the APA claims to be judged on evidence. We have a STRONG case on that though and the government likely doesn't want egg on its face. If SCOTUS goes against us good fucking luck, we have one more case that is slated for 1.5 years from now or so and besides that we're at the mercy of the new admin and congress (e.g. we lose 50% or so from here at least). WHERE WE HAVE BEEN: The previous admin promised to make changes and get us out of conservatorship and basically failed to deliver entirely. The companies cap standards are pretty miserable now and Mnuchin basically kicked the can down the road (pray to Yellen if you buy in cause you're her bitch now). Court cases have been like all court cases and infinitely slow but the gears do turn. HOW TO DO SOME DD: Go follow holdenwalker99 and urbankaoboy on Twitter. Do not follow Glenn. That guy is a fucking moron who has some major fucking ego problems. You will come across his name often on this trade as he is a good flag bearer, but don't pay any attention to his thinking, like I said, fucking moron. The two dudes I mentioned are probably the most rational and knowledgeable (respectively) people I have come across in the years I have been following it. Glenn is more like the mascot at a sports game while the other two are the players. Anyways, if you buy in, be prepared for the long haul. This trade is something that forever seems to be just a few weeks around the corner to a Nirvana that never comes. Many people have aptly called it the \"Waiting for Godot\" trade for that reason. Anyways, good luck! TL/DR - If you choose to go in buy jr pfds, avoid the ones that have zero % interest rates right now, and good fucking luck to us all.

Now NVAX has demonstrated best in class efficacy amongst all vax producers and has completed trials that were occurring where escape variants were rampant. They will likely still be severely undervalued until UK approval. Market cap is nothing compared to their competitors.

{"text": "I get it. You want our darling stock to go to the moon. I do too - I held 25 shares from $300 up to $483 and back down, and I averaged down holding all the way to the 30s and now I'm holding 170 shares. I intend to keep holding them. But when you call people bitches or pussies for taking a profit, you are giving ammunition for anyone to call WSB a plump and dumpling (actual words forbidden) forum, because those tactics are what plump and dumplingers use so they can exit confidently at the highest price. You're also feeding the narrative that WSB is acting as a single entity because you're deliberately trying to coerce someone into taking a particular action by verbally harassing them. So here's my advice: if you are trying to P&D our favorite stock, then fuck off. If you aren't, let other people make their own decisions without being bullied, but try to explain to them why it's in their interest to not be a \ud83e\uddfb\ud83e\udd32.

This is part of WSB's blood and really I don't have a problem with it. What I specifically take issue with is using insults to coerce people into not selling to increase your own profits. I get that you're not trying to take profits at the bullied person's expense, but to someone from the outside, that distinction isn't obvious. And it very well may end up being at the other person's expense depending on how this all shakes out. Let's not pretend we're not taking risks here.

{"text": "First, let's look at the players involved here. # The shorts On the short side, we have some hedge funds (most notably Melvin and Citadel) who aimed to make money by shorting gamestop, which they saw as a failing brick and mortar store chain. # The Market Makers (may have some overlap with the shorts) Marker makers write options (contracts to be allowed to buy (call) or sell (put) shares for a specific price at or before the expiry date). They collect a fee for selling those contracts, but they make the best profit if the contracts expiry worthless, because then they get to keep their fee, and don't need to keep their contract because it wasn't in the money. How does this work? Well, for example when GME was trading around $40, they sold contracts for $800 for the next month or so, never expecting the price of GME to even reach anywhere near $800, so the \"fools\" who bought the options to buy $800 calls for march 12th and march 19 will be left with worthless calls, or so they thought. (More on this later). # The longs On the long side, we have you glorious apes \ud83e\udd8d \ud83e\udd8d \ud83e\udd8d, Cohen, and competing hedge funds who are smelling blood and do not hesitate to pull the trigger on Melvin and other shorts, especially if they can make some money while doing so. Now let's look at the actions that have led up to this. It all started when the shorts were getting greedy, and with Covid19 thought they could pull the plug on gamestop, which they saw as a failing brick and mortar game store that would go the way of blockbuster. They did not expect gamestop would survive covid, and they did everything in their power to make it so. Shorting the company to the ground, with the goal being to drive the price to $0 for maximum and tax-free profit. It's important to point out that they COULD have covered at $3\\~$4 but DID NOT. If they did not cover at $3 or $4, what makes you think they covered at $40\\~$400? Hint: they didn't. In fact, they even admitted during the congress hearing to not covering by saying that the last peak to $400+ was just a gamma squeeze. In other words they have not even begun to cover yet. Then some people liked the stock. Some people may think this is insane, but if you do the math, you will see that no matter what FINRA says, it's impossible for short interest to be below 200%, and it's more likely to be around 500\\~600%. It's hard to find reliable data, but if you just look at the volume and price action, it's obvious that the shorts have only INCREASED since January 28th, not decreased. It is mathematically IMPOSSABLE for the shorts to have covered.

In other words, they will start buying BEFORE the price hits strike price. When the MMs sold $800 strike options while the price was at $40, they calculated it would be a 1 in a million chance or something really low that GME would hit $800 by march 12th. However, now, that chance is approaching 1% and climbing. The MMs still don't need to cover fully, but they are starting to consider the CHANCE of it happening is becoming more and more likely. So for each option (remember each option is 100 shares) they may be already buying 1 share per option for the 1% chance of it happening. But this very act may CAUSE it to happen. At some point, this is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Because MMs are 'insuring' their bets by buying shares just in case the price goes up, the price actually goes up, which means they need to insure even more, which creates a snowball effect. All the way up to, or beyond, the last option, which is at strike price $800. Similarly, the MMs probably considered it about maybe 5% likely that GME would hit 300 this week, but now it's more like 95% like, which means for each option contract with STRIKE 300, they will be buying 90 shares BEFORE the price hits 300 (which means about a million shares bought, which may actually cause the price to reach 300 in the first place!) They do this because they will be worse off when they have to buy in AFTER the price reached PAST 300 (then they will DEFINITLY make a loss). At least if they buy in BEFORE the price reaches $300, they can still make a profit or at least cut their losses. Remember, all parties are TRYING to make money, but not all of them succeed. So MMs are the ones driving the rally you have seen for the past few days, and looking at the above table, this will likely push the price towards, and likely over $800 either this week, or next week. You can also see in some particular numbers there's a LOT of shares that need to be covered, expect a lot of action when we APPROACH those numbers (for example, $300, $350, $400, $420, $500 and of course $800) as you can see, some of those numbers are close, and a gamma squeeze looks inevitable at this point. # This is only the GAMMA SQUEEZE. Now what about the short squeeze? Some people ask: \"Why don't the shorts just wait for the rally to be over, and buy when the price drops back to normal levels?\" Simple answer: they can't. Melvin was already down 53% the last time and they didn't even cover (that was just a gamma squeeze, by their own words). When a hedge fund has a short position, they can keep that position, as long as they have enough other assets to cover themselves. If the price of the asset they are short increases drastically (like in the event of a gamma squeeze), they will be FORCED to buy. As an example, let's say Hedge Fund M has $100 billion worth of assets, and shorts Company G for $1 billion at $10 per share. Now the price goes to $1000 per share, so they need to cover $100 billion for their shorts. This is an unacceptable risk, as their shorts are now losing more money than their entire portfolio can cover. So they will be forced to liquidate their assets and buy the shares they shorted. However, this very act will drive up the price (if you want to know how, read up on order books and slippage, this post is getting long enough as it is). In fact, this would usually happen long before they reach the point of bankruptcy, but seeing as Melvin managed to lose 53% and still didn't cover, it seems likely Melvin is too stubborn to cut their losses, and will ACTUALLY go bankrupt. This will leave the responsibility to cover with the clearing houses. The clearing houses are sure as hell not going to gamble (I'm pretty sure that's illegal). So the clearing houses would cover IMMEDIATLY, regardless of costs. Even if the feds literally has to print the money out of thin air. So TL;DR, it's a short squeeze because the shorts are FORCED to buy back their shorts, one way or another. Since they need to buy back hundreds of millions of shares (while only about 50 million or fewer are available) this will be \"name your price\" kind of prices. This is where $100k is NOT a meme. # IMPORTANT LAST POINT: Don't lose hope when the squeeze does not happen this week or the next, there are still lots of other triggers that can happen in the near future. Remember, it doesn't cost us anything to HODL, but it does cost them a lot to SHORT. Every day they are losing MILLIONS. Every day we keep the price above $0 is a WIN for us.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-03-10 20:40:56", "id": "m1urcd"}
{"text": "TLDR: VW's squeeze was very different to the coming GME squeeze and people should be careful of some maybe false promises here. Hello fellow ape friends... As I have seen many many posts and comments where people compare VW with GME and because Germany and my great great great grandfather uncle A.H. (just kidding) fucked up the world so bad I see it as my duty as a german retarded ape to clear some things up: Just recently one particular post/comment (Cant find it anymore) caught my eye where one of our fellow brothers said: Don't you worry about your exit strategy, you will have plenty of time to react, look at the VW squeeze that took forever as well. Yes but....WRONG! I don't want to tell you the whole VW story now... You can find it in the magical world of the www (Wikipedia or whatever), but to sum the important facts up for you: (Translated from german Wikipedia): \"An example of a short squeeze is the price explosion of Volkswagen ordinary shares that began on October 27, 2008. On October 26, 2008, the Porsche company announced that it had increased its stake in VW from 35% to 42.6% and, with options for a further 31.5%, would have a total stake of 74.1%. Speculators, especially hedge funds, had bet on falling prices and sold VW common shares short. Since the state of Lower Saxony held a further 20% of the VW shares, less than 6% of the VW shares remained freely tradable. The short sellers had borrowed 12% of the VW shares that they had to buy to repay the loan on the stock market. So they were in a short squeeze.\" In Short: Porsche had 74,1% Niedersachsen (Lower Saxony - \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02), a \"state\" of Germany had 20% So the free float available was at around only 6% and as mentioned above around 12% were borrowed. What's important here is: There were only TWO parties that had 94% of the stocks and they could just do whatever they wanted, it was very easy for them to just hold and the stock price went crazy for quite a long time,BUT: There are millions of apes like me and dozens of Hedgies and what more that got GME stocks, and every single person or institution has its one target price/planned sell price/price tolerance or whatever you wanna call it. And when some people will start to sell (and they will) and there will be some big drops, more and more paper handed bitches will sell just like in the first squeeze and it will go down FAST. Thats why you just can't compare those two at all and IMO the GME squeeze will happen much faster and you should really think deep about how and when you wanna exit this. To give this a final personal touch: Because of all the DD I've seen so far (Some of them are extraodinary) and the many Call Options at 800$ and that potential Gama squeeze I personally see a chance of about 95,7931% of GME hitting 1.000$ but not that much more.... Please dont stone me for that. However I also see a chance of 4,2069% (You really just got it now?) of GME hitting 42.069$ Since I am very new to Reddit let me Introduce myself: I am not a financial advisor, just a (german) retarded ape like you and I really like the stock! ...Made 5k\u20ac at first squeeze, bought in again after first drop and bagholded and average priced dow a little since then: Now holding 67 x GME @ 100\u20ac \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80 ...

{"text": "I'm sure a lot of you technical analysts have already spotted this and have your own opinions but I think this post could help bring some clarity for people who don't read charts. Just for the record, I am 19 and haven't been doing this for more than 6 months but it's basic data I'm showing. I'm also pretty retarded. Here we go.... I've noticed that the longer term chart patterns tend to be fractal because, I think, the smaller patterns are confirming the overall psychology of the market and with time, if the sentiment hasn't changed, those can be seen in a greater scale. Back in September of this year and lasting until November, a double bottom pattern formed in the index charts. The double bottom is a bullish pattern so most of us made some fucking tendies. If you zoom in the chart a bit on the first leg of the pattern you can see another, smaller double bottom that formed over two weeks. The sentiment in the market didn't change and this back and forth battle between bulls and bears continued but on a larger scale. Here's a picture, my monkey friends: Isn't she beautiful?. The double top has the same textbook rules as the double bottom, except the double top is bearish and it looks like an M instead of a W. Here's a chart of the SPX where that pattern can be seen: ( \u200b Since many traders have been waiting impatiently, and not very successfully, since about the first upward move after COVID for this moment of glory when they could short the market near the top, make some moolah, and say \"I told you so\"; there is definitely enough bearish sentiment to make the bigger double top pattern. Or maybe a dead cat bounce. I'm going to attach my hypothesis in the form of a chart here and you all share your thoughts. \u200b \u200b There has been huge upticks in red volume across the board. That's institutional volume. Smart money. Our trades need to be on the same side as the smart money when it comes to big cap stocks and the stocks that index's track, so we really do need to ignore retail sentiment here and try to figure out if institutions are taking profit and than buying the dip, or if enough of them are bearish that they kill momentum for a little while. The Feb 1 bull day didn't have high volume in several big cap stocks, cloudflare, walmart, etc and then there was the big slide after suggesting smart money wasn't interested in buying. Maybe different circumstances happed between that time. I've heard that some hedge funds had to sell so they could cover GME shorts but I don't think they have the capital anymore to buy those stocks back. Lol. \u200b \u200b Hopefully this post gets some attention and I didn't just spend two hours thoughtfully caressing my pecker with a feather pen for no reason. The point of me posting this isn't so I can convince you to sell, it's so we can make some money on the downside and prove to Jim Cramer and friends that we're not all a bunch of retards that only know how to hit buy. Shorting can be really damn profitable too. Am I onto something, or should I shut the fuck up and eat a few oranges? I'm not really qualified to be offering my opinion, I just want to start a discussion on what's happening.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-03-05 08:55:26", "id": "lxxrdk"}
{"text": "\u200b GME 5day 5min Chart, I noticed this week that AMC and GME's correlation seems to have fallen off.

I realistically see this hitting $100 in the coming year. RSI is in the oversold area at 48 currently. Shares are always an option but I\u2019m intrigued by the 8/20/21 calls. Currently going for $2.15. They would be after their august earnings call so you could sell on the ride up. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019ll hit $100 by august but realistically this will hit $80. That\u2019s a $20 upswing from current price. That\u2019s good profit. IV is 66.82, for the noobs, this is GOOD. Delta at .1841, gamma at .0099, theta at -0.0217, Vega at .1078, tho at .0403. These are very solid Greeks and IV, the premium on the strike price is a lot imo, but I just don\u2019t see a downside here. More importantly is all the states that are starting to legalize sports betting. Florida is pushing hard to legalize it. That is a massive market right there for $DKNG. POS: looking at 8/20/21 $100c @$2.15 TLDR: more states legalizing sports betting, Florida being one, sports starting to allow fans, more fans=more people betting. Potential upside to $100 this year, 8/20/21 $100c @ $2.15 current play it\u2019s after their earnings so sell on run up.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-03-06 09:36:37", "id": "lyovyl"}

{"text": "Yeah, you heard it right, and you most likely know that already, but lemme give you some technical rationale of how this might happen. The analysis is build upon fractal techniques, so that the previous price action is used for making this forecast. Buckle up and eat a Crayon, fellow trader (the word is used as anagram you know for what) as it will help you stay nutrated for the rest of this reading, and it might even help you with the digestion (of the information in the post). This is not a financial advice and I am not and a professional advisor, I just enjoy to share my knowledge and educate brainless apes occasionally. \"BuT whY dO I neEd your FARTCAL ANALizis?!1\" Well, that's a good question. When I was a young ape living free in the Steppes of Kazakhstan... JK, leave poor Vlad alone for a moment. The fractal (from Latin fractus) means a steady scalable design of irregular shape emerging on any data. The trade fractal in the financial market is the pattern, formed by a sequence(es) of candles, which has peculiar identifiable characteristics and a tendency to reoccur across different scales and time-frames. Fractals are simple yet important, repetitive formations used by traders to identify and to confirm a trend. Apely speaking, fartcals allow us to forecast the future price action based on the previous similar trends on a given trading instrument. Now that the captain is gone, let's get to business. GME fartcals wroom wroom above is a perfect example of beautiful fractals. The chart starts from the 11th of January with the turquoise slightly downward tilted consolidation. Next you see a relatively soft magenta upward impulse (14-16 Jan), followed by another turquoise consolidation, this time slightly tilting up and lasting for about three days. Next is where the things really start to get interesting (22nd Jan), as the subsequent magenta upward impulse accelerates exponentially. This accelerection does not go quietly, erupting into a powerful gap (not as big as the one in your head, though). Finally, starting 27th of Jan we have a local endgame highlighted by a purple rectangle with the apex (pay attention to this peak, as it will be used for calculations later) on the 27th of January. 'What? Why purple rectangle?' you may ask. Easy. REKTangles are the Horsemen of the Endgame. That was only the left part of the chart. Now let's be brief for a moment. There were six main components to the fractal base: turquoise consolidation, magenta uptrend, turquoise consolidation 2, magenta impulse, gap and purple rectangle. What you see on the right, is the original base for the fractal described above meets its bigger brother. Particularly, starting 22nd Feb a very similar chain of price actions manifests. And this is how we really utilize fractals: identify the fractal sequence from the previous data (on the left), and after that apply the pattern to similar market conditions (on the right). Many of the the things look really similar on both sides of the graph, don't they? Coincidence? I think not. \"Oh fArtcaLs good Butt WEN MOON?1!\" Here you go boy. Twice. Numbers and fractals simplified for dummies; 6 = Valhala REKTangle / GME go BBBBRRRRRRR Good boy/girl, you've come this far. Now that your confirmation bias is reinforced, you may get some rest. Or eat another nutritious crayon my brain destitute ape friend, because we are DIVING DEEPER. Ok, it turned out that I needed to eat some Crayons myself, because I really got exhausted writing the post for five hours in a row. So I ate a pack this time, and I am full of GMEnergy. As is the chart below, so bullish, that we will definitely see some GMEnergy explosions in a short time to come. Now the complexity of analysis is going to increase a little bit, but the apes have to evolve at one point in history, so I really encourage you to use this opportunity. In-depth fractal forecast. Ok, 1 2 3 4 5 6 is understandable, where did A B come from? The first and most important notice, is that A-B fractals are built upon 1-2-3-4-5-6, and on the chart you can see that A measures 1-2-3-4 pattern, while B covers 5-6 steps of the sequence. A-B on the left (January run) is self explanatory, the fractals are measured as they are. A-B on the right (current price action formation) is where we need some math to get involved, particularly, when we are working with the new B movement prediction. And that is not as difficult as it may seem from a first glance. Again, the main fractal property, re-occurrence, will play on our side. Predicting the price movements, on a volatile market like this one, is one of the most ungrateful things to do, so don't go too harsh on what I am going share with you, apesters. My theory, is that it is possible to predict the amplitude of the upcoming move, using data from previous one. And here, we only need the coefficient from first A-B move. A simple ratio: dividing first B move (about $325 increase) by first A move ($131) gives us a coefficient of about 2,48. Let's apply this ratio to the currently forming fractal: that is multiplying the second A fractal completed height (about $330 based on my prediction, which is built later in this post), which will give the estimated B part of the second fractal height of about $818, landing us on the sweet $1200 dollar level through the next week. Boom, looks beautiful and promising! Fractals, baby! I hope it has been an entertaining as well as mentally developing read for you so far, smoothie-brainie. But there is still one important part of the analysis left to be addressed. Particularly, it is the the sequence part number 4, where the price action stands currently. And yeah, you guessed it, almighty fractals are helping us here again. Below you will find two charts (both are 30 min charts), which are actually zoomed in the price actions of the fourth step of the two fractals analyzed above. I can't stop enjoying and appreciating fractals and below you should really see why. GME price action 22-27 January. That's it folks, mic drop.

{"text": "TL;DR: Cognyte (CGNT) will very likely be acquired by Nano-Dimensions (NNDM), in a form of merger called a Reverse Triangular Merger, for a number of reasons including: highly synergistic offerings, favorable tax treatment and government funding given enjoyed by both Israeli companies, posturing and hiring of new executives in the defense space with head of M&A being recent president at Verint systems division which was spun-off to become CGNT as of February 2021. The combined entity would be profitable due to CGNT\u2019s expanding margins and revenues along with NNDM\u2019s large cash position and cash burn that is manageable on the combined balance sheet. Additionally the combined entity would be an industry leader with more offerings and capabilities globally than their competitors of Palantir or Fire Eye. The acquisition will occur quickly and likely be funded significantly from NNDM stock and the rest cash. Given the mismatch of market caps and estimated BV multiple of 7x-10x CGNT shareholders will be winners in the merger transaction, achieving a very favorable stock-to-stock exchange rate + cash consideration. Conservative estimated total value per share realized from CGNT shareholders of 40% relative to current share price with 16% low end premium if deal terms inked in the past few months are realized mark to market. CGNT Overview (Lazy screenshots from Investor Presentation below): CGNT was recently spun off from Verint as a standalone entity, completed Feb. 1 \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b Why CGNT as Acquisition Target \u00b7 NNDM has been highly vocal that they are planning an Acquisition for some time \u00b7 From the 20-F SEC filings from both companies they state that there are tax and royalties penalties from merging/acquiring a non-Israeli company along with manufacturing products outside of Israel, which CGNT does have manufacturing plant in Israel. Acquisition target would likely need to be an Israeli Company \u00b7 Both companies receive funding from the IIA which is a material part of project funding, with ramifications from merging/acquiring non-Israeli company. \u00b7 CGNT is the cyber threat and security spin off of Verint with the spin off occurring Feb 1, 2021. They are profitable with their growth strategy being expanding enterprise customer base, growing deeper with existing customers, adding verticals. This fits well with NNDM as they can aid expansion of verticals for both enterprise and government via production of and protection of enterprise/5G/security operations devices (CGNT provides IP data theft identification and prevention which is critical for NNDM to serve large enterprise customers) \u00b7 From the AME Academy NNDM demos different device capabilities of their systems including 5g, implantable/tattooable sensors which would be synergistic for CGNT security operations \u00b7 CGNT business model of software as a service meshes perfectly with NNDM\u2019s plan to transition business model to software side from purely a manufacturer \u00b7 CGNT is profitable, the spin-off only makes sense if it was done for the purpose of a sale, 4 of 7 CGNT board members are current Verint board members/executives \u00b7 Hanan Gino appointed Chief Product Officer and Head of Strategic M&A: He was most recently in charge of the division of Verint that becam Why a Reverse Triangular Merger \u00b7 The licensing agreement between Verint and CGNT only allow critical IP to be used if they are using for existing business activities and are not acquired by a 3rd party. The agreement does allow to be used by affiliates via sublicensing. \u00b7 A reverse triangular merger allows the acquisition to take place while keeping critical licensing contracts intact for CGNT \u00b7 The target (CGNT) must own substantially all of its assets and perform substantially the same business activities in order to qualify. \u00b7 The benefit of this type of transaction allows the acquisition to take place tax free if certain conditions are met, 80% of consideration is stock of acquirer and not more than 20% cash (might act differently due to different Israeli regulations) \u00b7 This kind of transaction can be performed quickly with minimal regulatory and shareholder actionse CGNT \u00b7 CGNT wording within their 20-F filling allows them to pass a merger/acquisition with 25% shareholder approval, classified as Emerging Growth Company and aren\u2019t required to disclose proxy statements. They will easily be able to pass the merger without going through public shareholder announcement. What will NNDM need to Pay \u00b7 Current CGNT market cap of $1.6ish billion \u00b7 Recent filing from CGNT lists Book Value of the company as $301.5M \u00b7 Using some conservative multiples of 7x-10x book value using competitors like FireEye, Palantir and IBM we get a Price of $2.7B to acquire CGNT (8.7x Book Value, $40 per share) \u00b7 Value at Current NNDM Share Price: At 80% of the consideration being stock to be tax free the exchange rate of CGNT to NNDM shares would need to be around 4 shares of NNDM for every 1 share of CGNT in addition to $8 per share in cash. This isn\u2019t possible currently given that would exceed NNDM current shares outstanding so the cash consideration would need to be more or the agreed value of NNDM shares be higher (trading between 12-16 when CGNT was spun-off) \u200b Highlighted prices are around CGNT spin off \u00b7 If the agreed value is at the recent direct offering at 12.8 per share of NNDM then the consideration paid would be 2.5 shares of NNDM for every share of CGNT and an $8 per share cash consideration. (This exact case likely would not occur unless SP rises or considerably more cash is paid above the tax consequence of breaching 20% cash \u2013 Virent still controls board and needs to ensure significant value is provided to former shareholders and justify spin-off) \u00b7 NNDM has the ability and spare cash to repurchase shares in order to drive price up in order to get NNDM market price up the pre-determined exchange rate value \u00b7 SEC Filing on Feb 15. 2021 amends the company\u2019s articles to allow the board to call upon shares from shareholders giving further latitude for forcing acquisition if need be Other Notes and Consideration Options Activity \u00b7 Both CGNT and NNDM have extremely high options activity for May expirations \u00b7 NNDM Put/Call Open interest ratio of 0.53 indicates strong bearish sentiment \u00b7 CGNT Put/Call Open interest ratio of 0.06 and Put/Call volume of 0.01 indicates extremes in bearish sentiment but the extremeness of the value implies the opposite, being a major turning point CGNT is required to pay Verint a one time cash dividend of $35m, being an impact per share of $0.51, theoretically this should already be priced in but the merger announcement would likely be after this payment is complete. CGNT has affiliations with a blank cheque company according to the SEC website indicating that the merger has already been planned as a blank cheque company is required for a Reverse Triangular Merger. Risk Factors \u00b7 NNDM stock is driven further down or doesn\u2019t recover and the deal goes through anyway at unfavorable terms \u00b7 The combination of the two entities are viewed negatively and value is lost \u00b7 I completely misinterpreted the SEC fillings and Israeli tax laws \u00b7 The deal does not go through and the standalone CGNT entity is worth far less than expected \u00b7 CGNT was left with unknown liabilities passed off from Verint \u00b7 CGNT financials are misstated and fraudulent Conclusion While I think that NNDM will acquire CGNT if I am wrong about that I still believe that CGNT is an acquisition target for another company based on my findings. If a merger doesn\u2019t happen CGNT is still a strong play in their sector and has strong growth and profitability in the same industry as Palantir which saw ridiculous amounts of interest. I think the risks associated with this play are managed well, my view of probability of high returns in a short amount of time make for excellent risk adjusted return potential.

{"text": "Hopefully most of you are getting your vaccine and you\u2019re thinking about how important your health is. Now I may be called a boomer with this pick I can promise you I\u2019m not. CVS Health is the largest healthcare company in the US with about the 4th/5th largest amount of revenue of all companies. They are projected to earn about $7.50 this year and over $8 next year which at the current price of $75 in insanely cheap in a market seeing the overall market trading at ~25x earnings. Why is so cheap you may ask? Well I\u2019d argue it\u2019s for two reasons 1) Constant fear around Amazon 2) Concern they paid too much for Aetna a few years back. People always fear the unknown and it\u2019s usually from a place of misunderstanding. Let\u2019s take Amazon first. Amazon awhile back said they were going to get into Healthcare and formed a venture with Berkshire and JPM called Haven. I think CVS stock and others dropped 15% on the news when first announced. Now these are big companies and if anyone is going to upend the model it would be them. Well flash forward a few years and they disbanded the operation citing it was too challenging or something like that. This past year Amazon also made news by launching Amazon Pharmacy and more recently Amazon Telehealth for employers. I get what you\u2019re thinking oh no here they come it\u2019s over. This is absolutely hilarious if you actually understood how CVS makes money. Let me tell you how: CVS has a few primary businesses: CVS Caremark, CVS Aetna, and CVS retail. CVS Caremark is the largest drug dealer in the US. They are what is referred to as a PBM or prescription benefit manager. As an employer whether it be a public government agency or private employer like Amazon you go through a PBM to acquire your drug benefit coverage for your employees. CVS has thousands of employers ironically including Berkshire, JPM, and Amazon as clients. There are really only three main players in the space (Optum, Express Scripts, and Caremark) which are owned by United Health, Cigna, and CVS which also happen to be health insurers which we\u2019ll get to later. This is where scale really matters. As an employer you want to give your employees the cheapest drugs. As a PBM you use your purchasing power across your customers to buy drugs from manufacturers at the lowest cost. This is why these 3 companies have an impenetrable moat in this industry. Caremark probably buys almost 1/3 of the drugs dispensed in this country. This is why I laugh when I think about the Amazon fears. There is no way they could ever reach the scale of buying power to price drugs low enough to entice employers and government agencies to switch. Unless they\u2019re throwing in a free Prime membership for everyone I think it\u2019s basically impossible for them to break in unless they buy one of the big 3. So what is Amazon Pharmacy you ask? Amazon Pharmacy is just a re-branding of Amazon Pillpack their mail order pharmacy they acquired a few years back. Is it not a threat? Not in the least and that goes back to the pricing model many people don\u2019t understand. Let me explain. If you\u2019re covered by Caremark as an employee of say Wells Fargo you can go anywhere to fill your prescription...CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Costco, or even Amazon. However if you go onto GoodRx and enter your insurance info you\u2019ll see that there are a variety of prices for the same drug. It will always be cheapest at CVS as Caremark will give CVS the best rates. What\u2019s better is all those other places actually pay CVS to be included in their network and have access to their PBM network. So if you fill at Walgreens they make money and if you fill at CVS they make more money. So when people say Walgreens is just a drug store but CVS is more than a drugstore this is part of it. Walgreens and other places you fill drugs don\u2019t have PBMs that represent a huge % of America\u2019s insured. Now let\u2019s get to the real undervalued gem in their business Aetna. Aetna is the health insurance side of the business and fastest growing. This is the other part of the equation for employee benefits and again same major players in United Healthcare and Cigna. This business encompasses health and dental insurance. Aetna was acquired a few years back in one of the largest acquisitions and largely funded by debt. As you can imagine Wall St hated the deal except for the bankers that did it of course. What\u2019s crazy is CVS was surprised and ecstatic that the deal even closed as it was heavily scrutinized by the Justice department at the time. What I would say about a deal that large is no Board would sign off on that if there wasn\u2019t huge upside to the deal. I mean talk about YOLO let\u2019s borrow a ton of money ($60B) and buy a company. If you are doing that there better be 3x or more the upside, right? So what was Wall St missing? Well first you have to understand the health insurance business which is the same premise as any insurance business which is to insure against risks. Geico insures you against a major car accident while Aetna insures you against a major medical surgery or cancer treatment. What many people don\u2019t understand is the #1 cause of a major medical expense is usually preventive maintenance. Yes exercise but more so taking your medication. I like to say this is akin to Geico being able to tap your breaks if you start to speed in your car. CVS has your health data and if you\u2019re an Aetna member they\u2019re insuring you. So CVS can use that data to intervene early to prevent a major medical event they\u2019d have to pay out on down the road. This is a win/win for all involved and is how CVS is going to change healthcare. I mean this is a health flywheel that will just allow them to win more business. Where I\u2019m most excited for them is for their Health Hub strategy. If you are unfamiliar think of it as urgent care within CVS stores. Why I\u2019m most excited is because of what it allows them to do that their competitors can\u2019t. I\u2019m a parent and my wife and I have had many ear infections that we\u2019ve had to run to the Little Clinic which is a similar concept you may have seen in Fry\u2019s grocery stores. Today with our insurance an ear infection and a Little Clinic visit is about $75. Well Aetna is rolling out $0 co-pay plans for these acute care needs at Health Hub stores. $0 is pretty nice! So next time we have an ear infection we can roll up to a CVS Health Hub and get the kiddos checked out, pick up the script for meds, and pick up a bottle of wine for us on the way out. This has huge implications for the industry that nobody is quite grasping yet. It also has huge implications for the retail part of their business that will drive a ton more foot traffic and profits. Just today they said by 2030 they are looking to do 75 billion health interactions. For reference Teladoc did 15M last year in a pandemic year. So hopefully I\u2019ve cleared up a lot of misconceptions about CVS and the true business they are in along with who their true competitors are. They are really in an oligopoly with 3 players who have paid the price of admission which is having a PBM and Health Insurance business combination. If Amazon truly wanted to play in this space my belief is that they\u2019d have to acquire one of the 3 as they would have to buy business to compete with the scale/spend on drugs. I honestly think they realized with Haven that this is a tough nut to crack. So oligopoly businesses are usually good to invest in but the one you want to own is CVS because they have a monopoly in stores. There is a CVS within a few miles of everyone in the US which allows them to unlock a lot of value that people have written off as useless before. Valuation: Currently trading at $75 which is ~10 earnings in a market that is over 25x. So it\u2019s way too cheap here but this isn\u2019t a stock to YOLO weekly calls on this is stock to own for a long time. A couple years back they put out an investor presentation showing 10% EPS growth annually past 2022. The best part is it was based on 28% tax rates so tax increases baked in. If you actually model this out this decade you\u2019re talking $19+ dollars EPS in 2030. Throw a 15-20 multiple on that and you\u2019re at $300+. Now I know stocks were going up like that in a month (ahem GME) but for the most part investors shouldn\u2019t ever expect those returns overnight. SP500 annual avg. return is 10% and with where valuations and interest rates are at I suspect we\u2019ll be lucky this decade to average that. So going back to CVS at current price of $75 with $300+ at end of this decade in the cards that works out to a pretty nice avg annualized return of close to 20% assuming you reinvest the dividends. And people might scoff at the thought of them doing double digit EPS growth but if you look up pre Aetna they did just that. Even if they fall short you might see 15% avg annualized which as an investor you can\u2019t expect much better.

{"text": "CLOV has a very interesting setup right now but way too many people seem to only care about the short float debate that has been unfolding over the last few days. To sum that up: FactSet (top financial data provider) had the CLOV float listed as 23.5M and short interest at 39M - putting the percentage of the float shorted at 146.6%. This circulated online and has been argued on twitter and reddit starting Friday. Factset has since updated the float to 109.8M making the 39M short interest account for 36% of the float. They previously had deducted the CEO\u2019s class B shares from the total class A shares, and although his shares are \u201cnon-tradeable\u201d and shouldn't be included in the public float, they were only using the class A shares to determine the float as all class B shares are already non-tradeable unless converted - so shouldn\u2019t have been part of the equation to begin with. Now I could get more into the \"Hindenberg said this\u201d and \u201cS3 said this\u201d bullshit that people have been arguing about... But heres why NONE OF THAT EVEN FUCKING MATTERS Shorts and those who have been bashing CLOV and arguing against the original short float number are taking a victory lap, like Factset updating the short float to 36% destroys the entire bullish case for CLOV and now it will tank. BULLSHIT, here\u2019s why: The 39M short interest number being used in the short float calculation is from 3/31. Over two weeks ago. When the two highest volume and highest short volume days in CLOV history have occurred within the last two weeks. With \\~30M short volume on 4/8 and \\~90M short volume on Friday (according to Fintel). We don\u2019t know at this time how much of the short volume is covered and would be included in the current short interest; but given all this, you could logically conclude the short float on CLOV right now could be pretty damn high. For context, 36% short float - based on outdated short interest from 3/31 - is in the ballpark of double what we're currently seeing in GME or AMC, and would still make CLOV one of the highest short float stocks in the entire market right now. The short float is only a small piece of the puzzle, and it\u2019s without a doubt high enough to trigger a short squeeze if price continues to rise, end of story. Now let\u2019s get into the shit that really matters. First off, from a technical perspective, there are some good signs. (if you hate technical analysis or think you're so good at it that you'll find a way to disagree with whatever I say then skip to the next section) MACD bullish RSI only starting to warm up Decent support built between $7-$7.30 But what\u2019s really screaming on this chart are these two recent MASSIVE buying volume days coming after about a month of consolidation with a double bottom pattern making higher lows. Now let\u2019s get into call volume Some of the order that came through Friday it can be a good indicator of where money is flowing in the market and 2) the people who write the call options need to buy shares to hedge against their position. The more the price rises the more shares they need to buy, helping to push price higher just like we see in a short squeeze. \u200b Next, CLOV is down over 50% from Dec/Jan highs. Some of the main reasons for the drop would be: Money flowing out of growth stocks and SPACS Hindenberg short report * Short seller price manipulation The Hindenburg short attack really did a number on CLOV. The stock was trading at about $14 prior to the release of their short report and dropped over 50% in the weeks following its release. Hindenburg attacked CLOV from many different angles. One of their main arguments being that Clover Health uses misleading and unethical marketing practices to boost sales, as evidence stating that in 2016: \u201cClover was fined for misleading marketing practices by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u201d Well, just this month (April 8th), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services granted Clover heath approval in 10 new states. CLOV has yet to release a PR on this but it has been updated on the CMS website (see picture below). The stock price jumped with huge volume on this news but short sellers were able to manipulate it back down until the spike we just saw on Friday. It seems that Hindenbergs argument doesn\u2019t hold up as the same federal agency (CMS) they were using to support claims against Clover Health is currently supporting Clovers expansion into 10 new states. Which is huge news for CLOV by the way. \u200b Wrapping this up Now say what you will about Chamath, but he had retail investors back during the GME squeeze. He promoted it, posted his personal positions, and while Wall Street, CNBC, and others attacked Gamestop, Chamath defended retail traders and the movement as a whole. It may be a total coincidence that his SPAC\u2019s were the target of short attacks shortly after, but his support of the GME squeeze may have made him a bigger target. \u200b No one knows what will happen in the market, I sure as hell don\u2019t, but given all that's been laid out here, I like the stock. $CLOV to $100 \u200b EDIT: anyone who thinks this is part of a conspiracy to distract from GME, it's not. Holding GME, love the setup going into this week. Also: this is not financial advice, do your own DD blah blah blah And for those asking about my position. I'm looking to add shares and calls Monday and/or throughout the week based on the price action and within my own personal risk tolerance. \u200b Update 4/20: people asking if they should sell. You shouldn't be trading if you need someone to tell you. Nothing has changed. The market dumped and people sold. If there's not enough buying pressure selling can take over. Doesn't mean buyers won't take back control. Long term, my opinion is that anything under $15 is a buy. Dips are opportunities. Not worried. I like the stock.

{"text": "WWE, isn't that that the industry where grown men fondle each other for a living? Yes, yes it is. They are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and have been under the radar for a while despite all they have going for them coming into this week. Part 1: Collectables As you read this, World Wrestling Entertainment is holding their 37th annual WrestleMania event over this weekend from Saturday to Sunday. What makes this one different? Well for one, it\u2019s the first event to have ticketed fans in attendance since the start of COVID. However, I'm more interested in their newly acquired money printer. Enter the world of collectables: Where tweets go for $2.5 million, pixels sell for millions, and your local mailman is scrambling to sell their farts as collectables for $400 a piece. The NBA was quick to take advantage of this craze, selling a collectable of lebron james for $200,000 and has seen $230 million spent in trading on their platform. What's the profit margin on something like this? What could be the cost of creating these pixels? As you probably guessed, it's an unsurprising near 100% profit margin. Collectables are making a comeback and WWE has been quick to notice. They have for the first time released a set of them this weekend to accompany WrestleMania 37. As I write this, their Silver Card have sold out at a total price tag of $37,000. The Gold currently has a bid of over $13,000. Lastly, Platinum has a whopping $100,000 bid with 4 hours left to go. This marks only the beginning of something that will grow to a multimillion dollar revenue stream for WWE. Collectables sell, and when you have such a cult following as the WWE crowd, there's no shortage of people willing to pay big money for ownership. The media has been covering various sales recently, and we could see media attention in the upcoming week once the sales are closed out tonight. Part 2: Reopening In 2019, WWE had 310 live shows with generally sold out crowds. In 2020, they had 42. Q4 earnings fell 26% from Q4 2019. Revenue was 238.2 million, EPS of 16 cents. Pretty well below expectations. Now, that shouldn't be all that shocking, nobody could go see the shows. 2021 will tell a different story. This weekend\u2019s Wrestlemania 37 is the first event to have ticketed fans in attendance since COVID-19 started. The company has announced a sell out crowd of 25,675 fans in attendance for Wrestlemania 37, and the crowds will only get larger from here. It is already rumored that Wrestlemania 69 is set to take place on Mars. Putting aside the obvious upcoming growth, WWE has already seen a year over year increase in operating income to 332.5 million. A near 74% increase from 2019. All of that with COVID, how could that be? The bulk of that increase is coming from rises in content fees. WWE knows what they are doing. They are smart with their money, and are ready to slingshot into orbit with old(Live Audiences) and new(collectables) revenue streams just now coming into play. Which brings me to my next point. WWE has been in an agreement with Saudi Arabia to do two shows per year. The cost is $50 million per show. These shows didn't happen in 2020 and WWE was not paid their due $100 million. Instead, WWE has extended the contract until shows can resume and this agreement lasts for ten years. Now, $100 million doesn't seem like a lot in the context of a company with a 4B market cap, but considering that WWE raised its operating income by nearly 74 percent to 332.5 million WITHOUT the expected $100 million from the Saudi's is nothing short of impressive. How can a company that should have been held down so much during COVID just keep prospering? Part 3: Shorts I know what most of you are probably thinking. \"GME first\" or \"ItS hEaViLy ShOrTeD\", but I just couldn't leave this one out. Nearly 20% of the float is short with 7 days to cover. This is a prime example of a stock that is turning everything around and is about to go ballistic in terms of revenue. Now I'm not saying a squeeze is imminent, but it\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility. With all the news and new revenue, I see many exiting their positions this upcoming week, gradually driving the price higher. This is a stock that has hardly been touched by retail investors and has 40% insider ownership, so the possibilities are endless. Disclaimer: I\u2019m a retard just like anyone else on here so obviously do your own research before jumping in. (read the entire post, its a shit tldr)TLDR: WWE is taking full advantage of the collectable craze and their cult following this weekend as they release their first collectables, with bids already at $100,000. They just keep financially prospering in a time when they should be suffering. 2020 was their most profitable year in WWE history despite no live audiences. This weekend\u2019s Wrestlemania is the first show to bring in a live audience since COVID started, selling out and bringing in over 25,000 fans, and this is just the beginning. Revenue is about to explode from live shows, collectables, and reopening. The cherry on top is the 20% short that is going to send this to the stratosphere this week.

{"text": "Have been seeing a lot of negativity around Coinbase so wanted to provide an echo chamber for us bulls who FOMO'd in near the open. First off, Coinbase should not be valued as an exchange, it makes no sense to compare it to Nasdaq or NYSE. COIN is rapidly growing, has a vastly different transaction structure, and is beginning to expand into the services market. Now let's get into some numbers. 2020 Revenue was 1.28 B which is 140% growth over 2019, that is ridiculous. The really crazy number, 1.8 B in revenue for Q1 2021. They had 50% more revenue in Q1 2021 than the entirety of 2020. Let that sink in for a minute. Net Income for Q1 2021 was also around 750 M. If they were to sustain this net income for the rest of the year, that would put them at a 28 P/E ratio... for a company growing this quick? It's important to keep in mind that this was a record quarter for COIN and likely not sustainable near term but it still shows what they are capable of. Additionally, they announced that they are up to 56 million users with 6.1 of those being Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) in Q1 2021. This is a massive jump over the previous quarter and COIN explains that the rise in MTUs is largely due to the increase in price and volatility around virtual currencies. For some reference, Robinhood has 13 million monthly users but get nowhere near the revenue per user that COIN does. These \"virtual currencies\" have continued increasing so far in Q2 2021 so I am expecting another knockout quarter in both revenue and MTUs. Expect the Q2 earnings report to blow past expectations (think massive tendie spike). Speaking of those beefy transaction fees that COIN gets, there's no way that's sustainable right? It's going to be a race to the bottom, just like the stock trading fees? Well, not exactly. Investors love how simple Coinbase makes trading and are willing to pay a small premium for this ease of use. Currently, fees are massive percentagewise for small trades but become pretty reasonable at a large scale. I could see them lowering rates significantly for these small trades once they build up some more consistent institutional trading revenue and service revenue. There's probably some reason to worry about declining margins in the transaction side of the business, however, that's not why COIN deserves to hit $500+. Coinbase's services platform is massively undervalued and is something the mainstream media largely ignores. This segment of the business is growing very quickly and should not be overlooked. If you look at what Cathie Wood says about digital wallets, it should be clear how much potential Coinbase has to monetize it's users. It's creating an entire financial ecosystem built around Coinbase that's designed to keep users around.

{"text": "TLDR: $GOEV has been shorted heavily over the past 2 weeks. There are currently 0 shares left to borrow and borrow rates were in excess of 40% yesterday. GOEV has a history of failure to deliver; combine this with high call option volume, and you have a lot of tinder. If the share price reverses (and depending on how quickly) this could be a prime squeeze candidate. Canoo ($GOEV) has been beaten into oblivion over the past 2 weeks, and now trades at a steep discount to the SPAC vehicle that acquired it. This came after a disappointing earnings call and a major shakeup in the business model as well as leadership. Obviously there is a lot of FUD in the stock, and shorts have taken advantage of this sentiment to drive down the price. No Shares Available to Borrow: In fact, the amount of shorting over the past 2 weeks has now resulted in 0 shares available to borrow (according to fintel). High Recent Short Volume: As you can see there have been ~10M shares sold short over the past 2 weeks, and GOEV already had a 15% short interest before this. Add this all up you could have anywhere from 50-60% of the float currently sold short. Failure to deliver: GOEV also has a history of high failure to deliver whenever the price spikes. There were over 1.1M shares that failed to be delivered on 03/22. This indicates that shorts are overextending themselves. Gamma Squeeze Potential: There is also extremely high call volume for the $10 and $15 strike, so if it starts to approach those price levels there will be increased buying pressure due to gamma hedging. Main takeaway: If the stock starts to reverse course before the shorts cover this could jump very fast to $10-15 again.

{"text": "We just closed 10 green days in a row. The hasn't happened since August 2020. Based on the price of the S&P futures right now, the 1d RSI SPY just passes 70. It hasn't done that since late August before Spy fell $34 in 3 days. The day before that crash the 9 day MA was $9 below and the 50d MA was $30 below. Right now, based on current futures, the 9 day MA is $8 below and the 50d MA is $21 below. The biggest separation since the Sept crash. Our 30 day volume is 55 million, which is 4 million more than august before volume spiked to 149M before Spy dropped $14 in a single day. The comparison between later August and this month's volume and price action is nearly identical. The reason why I'm comparing this specifically to the early Sept crash is because no news triggered that crash, indicators were just severally alarming and we had been in HEAVILY overbought territory for 7 days. Then a couple firms liquidated their heavily profited tech positions and caused the algos to trigger a crash. Tomorrow marks the first day of our heavily overbought territory. Since Tech caused the crash last time, let's look at QQQ The MA before the Sept crash? 60 points off. Right now? 52 points off. RSI last time? 75. RSI now? 67. The Stochastic just flipped today, as it did last time 4 days before the crash. And while we're at it, small caps last time fell 1 month before the Sept crash and didn't recover, similarly to how they are still lagging considerably behind Spy and QQQ right now. Spy needs to hit it's support line (392) to keep the algos happy. And eventually, the algos always get what they want. I know TA is just crayons on graph, and news and market sentiment is more important. But for short term option gambling, there's a lot of red flags indicating we are due for a pull back.

Of course, this is a wendy's, not a financial consultancy, so this is not advice, but APHA's slide as of late is quite contrary to future market expectations with NY legalization and VA speeding things along. Schumer and the Dems have indicated legalization is a priority. Biden will probably(?) sign it. APHA is at a large discount following this week's slide. (Roughly a 14% discount to be exact.) Consider that an APHA share = .83 TLRY shares and you have a pretty substantial gain to be made if you buy APHA at this price and it converts to TLRY at the current price of $17.40. My crayon-napkin math indicates a gain of about 2-3% using current prices. On top of that, the combined entity TLRY (following the merger) will be the largest weed company by revenue, meaning they'll likely be able to swallow a lot of market share in the US and EU following U.S. legalization, the EU thing is already ongoing.

The full chart is visible [here, we see a strong reaction from the buyers on the market. While the sellers are preventing the buyers from making higher highs, we can also observe that the buyers support the price with higher lows - which results in the symmetrical shape. This is a simplification of how the buyers & sellers are acting on the market, and they are finally the ones who decide where the price is going next. The decreasing volume confirms this behavior. This breakout will drag more interest into the market, and we will see more price action (more volume). Now we're looking at a change of structure/ sentiment. The buyers were basically stronger than the sellers, and they managed to push the price above the previous high at $165.00, which is the first sign of an upwards trend. When we're looking at an upwards trend, we want to price to make higher highs and higher lows, supported by increasing volume. We want the market participants to confirm the breakout with trading action. Buyers & Sellers usually look for previous price peaks to either leave the market or to enter the market. So we can expect small retracements at the previous highs (horizontal lines), followed by further price movements towards the next high. This upwards trend is currently supported by the MA200 (grey line), which is a great entry for those wo might want to join the party.

{"text": "Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA) is an advanced biotechnology company developing medical treatments with the use of CRISPR. Unsmooth your brain - background on CRISPR: Now, what the fuck is a CRISPR and why am I bothering to explain it? CRISPR is literally one of the most important inventions of all time. I'm not exaggerating. Your ape body is made of trillions of little fuckers called cells. You have all kinds of cells inside you - skin cells, blood cells, bone cells, etc. Some of us here even have brain cells. But inside all those cells, there's something called DNA. You've heard that mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell. Well DNA is the CEO of the cell. It makes pretty much all the decisions, and is also the instruction manual/blueprint for how to make every part of the cell. Now, imagine we can take the DNA instructions to make the chemical that makes a bug glow in the dark, and stick it in a banana. Think how much money we would make selling glow in the dark bananas to apes looking for a midnight snack. That's what CRISPR is. It lets you take DNA from pretty much anything and stick it pretty much anywhere inside another piece of DNA. Why NTLA? Making glow in the dark bananas is cool, but what if we used this to, idk, help people? Couldn't we just inject some magic DNA into people and cure their diseases? Yup. And NTLA are the first ones to do it. Late last year, the first human had the DNA in every cell in their body altered using CRISPR technology. This experimental \"drug\", NTLA2001, is for a rare genetic disorder that can be very painful and dangerous. Until now, medications have only been able to treat the symptoms. NTLA2001 (theoretically) cures the disease, permanently. Why now? On Tuesday, the EU declared NTLA2001 an orphan drug. Orphan drugs are medical treatments that are deemed important enough to have around even though the disease they treat is rare. Important enough to have around that the government subsidize the research and production for that orphan drug. So not only do we have a world's first whole-body CRISPR therapy - which alone is enough to make the likes of Cathie Wood sploosh - but it just got bankrolled by the entire goddamn European Union. Strategy This is a long-term HODL move. But what a long-term HODL move it is. Imagine you're buying AAPL/MSFT in the 80s or AMZN/TSLA in the 00s. This is not the only CRISPR company, but of the Big Three (NTLA, CRSP, and EDIT) it's got the most momentum, making it suitable for shorter term plays as well. TL;DR - WRINKLY BRAIN GENIUS APES AT INTELLIA ($NTLA) GET BANKROLLED BY EUROPE TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING FIRST OF NEW CLASS OF WORLD-CHANGING MEDICINES. E: best immediate move would be to pick up long calls and/or LEAPS. I would want to see it dip to the 65-70 range to buy shares I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice.

{"text": "See my previous AMD DDs: [ [ Everything there came true, except the stock is down today. Why? Well take a look at the short interest. AMD is the most heavily shorted stock in the semi industry. The latest there shows 82.7M shares sold short on 4/15 with price at $85.21. That means they need to keep the stock under $85 to make their precious profit. They also want to keep the stock down in order to get a good buy-in for the Xilinx deal. Which means it seems they're trying to keep the stock down for the entire year until the Xilinx deal closes, that's a long time to keep up negative pressure. Meanwhile, AMD is going to continue to get upgrades and price target increases. I know everyone hates Jim Cramer but this is what he said in regards to AMD on the AAP call this morning: \"This is just a buy. I mean, you gotta buy it very aggressively here. Because if it weren't for the Xilinx arbitrage, it would probably be up. But remember, it has to be shorted if you want to buy Xilinx and that's what's killing them. Because people just keep shorting it all day. There's 51M shares traded, which is rather remarkable.\" One could speculate that Intel is coming in to steal AMD's thunder but in yesterday's earnings call, AMD put that to rest. Intel's datacenter sales were down 20% YoY which Intel last week said was NOT due to competition but due to customers \"digesting\" existing purchases and that this is a slow time of year for data center sales. AMD's Dr. Lisa Su shows 100% growth in datacenter sales YoY saying customer demand is strong and accelerating, basically calling Intel liars and that AMD is taking all that market share with no slow down in sight. One could speculate that Nvidia is going to challenge AMD in the datacenter but Su Bae dismissed it in the earnings call saying customers are not asking for ARM chips, and AMD would build them if they were. Basically saying that building an ARM processor for the datacenter would be like building a solution to a problem no one has, and no one is asking for, there's no money in it. One could speculate that the \"chip shortage\" will negatively impact AMD. But the good doctor put that to rest yesterday as well confirming rumors that AMD is increasing production by 20% in Q2 which reflected in them raising guidance for 50% growth in 2021! By contrast, Intel is expecting 0% growth this year. All of this positive growth and lack of industry competition means AMD is going to continue killing in quarter after quarter which will push analysts to keep upgrading the stock and price targets which will make it harder and harder for hedge funds to keep up the negative pressure throughout the year. With AMD, there's no need for individual investors to try to turn it around on the short sells, it's going to happen naturally due to continued analyst upgrades, we don't have to do anything. I recommend getting on board now and being patient, because when it pops and the short sellers give up/move on, when the negative pressure cannot contain the buying from institutions and individual investors on analyst upgrades, it's going to explode. AMD Positions: 550 shares, various call options with expirations from June 2021 to June 2022. UPDATE: BoA upgraded AMD price target from $100 to $110 and named AMD their #1 pick in all of computing. Rosenblatt has a $135 price target. It's only a matter of time before upward pressure overcomes downward pressure and this thing explodes.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-04-29 04:39:13", "id": "n0kaye"}
{"text": "Disclaimer: If you\u2019re here for rocket emojis and short squeezes, move along. I\u2019m not going to be offering any certainty here, nor am I going to tell you exactly how to play CS. That said, if you\u2019re going to stick around, I hope you enjoy! To understand what\u2019s going on with Credit Suisse right now, we have to first discuss two major events that happened in the financial world since the last quarterly report: The collapse of Greensill and Archegos. Greensill Capital was a supply chain financial services company that made money in three ways: * Reverse factoring^1. In response, Tokio Marine ceased insuring Greensill, leaving $4.8 billion of working capital uninsured. Greensill attempted to get an extension of coverage but failed and was forced to look for a new insurer. The problem was that no one wanted to insure them. On March 1st, 2021, after eight months of having billions of uninsured working capital and even more default insurance that expired over that previous weekend, Credit Suisse began freezing supply-chain investment funds in Greensill. That very same day, Greensill began filing for insolvency, and insolvency protection was granted on the 8th of March. I\u2019ll skip the boring stuff, but Credit Suisse\u2019s loss is estimated to be roughly $3 billion. I don\u2019t know exactly how much of that is going to hit CS directly vs. their clients, but needless to say, it won\u2019t be pretty either way. Now let\u2019s talk about Archegos. Archegos was a family office that imploded in March of 2021. In order to understand what happened, you need to first understand what a Total Return Swap is.^4, a TRS allows you to ask the bank to hold a stock for you and pay you any appreciation or dividends, and you pay them a fixed (or sometimes variable) rate in return. This allows you to benefit from a share of a stock as if you held it yourself, but without having to actually own it. Because you don\u2019t own the stock yourself with a TRS, Archegos was able to get a metric fuckton of loans without reporting their ViacomCBS (VIAC) and Discovery (DISCA) positions, thereby deceiving the loaners as to just how exposed and heavily leveraged they were on highly volatile positions.^5. This resulted in an additional 27% drop. Certain banks were able to get out faster than others, but CS and Nomura were especially slow to act. So, what was the result of all of this? All-in-all, Archegos is expected to cost Credit Suisse somewhere in the ballpark of $4.7 billion.^6 for the past three years. So, with all of these big, scary numbers, why am I still bullish? Simply put, their balance sheet doesn\u2019t justify the hit Credit Suisse\u2019s stock took. CS had $805.8 billion in assets, $139.1 billion (17.3%) of that in cash alone as of December 31st, 2020.^8 is significantly bigger, constituting an 11.7% hit after subtracting liabilities. However, this, in my opinion, does not justify the ~30% hit the stock has taken.^9,^11, too big to fail. The responsible executives have also been removed^( which shows they are going to be taking their risk management far more seriously in the future. Loss prevention on this scale will probably not happen again for some time because this loss is going to be at the forefront of their minds for a while. How can this play go wrong then? Well, in the long-term, I\u2019m fairly confident I\u2019m right and that the market is overreacting to Greensill and Archegos. It did wipe about three years of profit from the balance sheet, but financially, the company is in a pretty solid place regardless. The more important variable is how it affected client trust, which will be difficult to gauge. I think there are fundamentally too many positive forces holding CS up to allow it to fall, but the current price reflects an overly bearish scenario. People are comparing Archegos to Longterm Capital Management when that is simply not the case. LTCM ended up leveraging themselves to the tune of $1.25 trillion while Archegos lost somewhere in the ballpark of $10-$20 billion with VIAC and DISCA. That said, CS certainly has the opportunity to go south in the short term. CS reports Q1 results on April 22nd, two days from now^( and, especially considering the market\u2019s behavior over the past several days, I think it\u2019s possible that investors will panic after listening to the earnings call. They may overestimate the damage, sell in fear, and cause the stock to drop even further. The reality is that this bank is not going anywhere. CS is going to be around in 5-10 years no matter what, yet the current pricing feels like investors expect doomsday on April 22nd. The second scenario is that the earnings call inspires confidence, although I personally this is less likely due to the fact that this did wipe out three years of profit. In this scenario, the best-case scenario I can realistically see happening is CS trading sideways, since some people are going to sell anyway. If it does dip, I\u2019m hoping to pick up as many of those shares as possible. I want to be clear that I still very much have questions about how the fine details are going to work when it comes to the loss\u2019s interaction with Credit Suisse\u2019s balance sheet. I am not quite sure what amount of the damage is going to hit CS\u2019s clients vs. falling directly on Credit Suisse. The answer to that question is very relevant, yet I have not been able to find a clear answer. I also do not know for sure what the post-earnings reaction will be. My guess is just that: a guess. Also, if I\u2019m missing or misanalyzing this, please do call me out as I genuinely want this to be the highest quality DD possible. Thanks for reading to the end! Edit: I'm aware GS and MS destroyed CS here - hell, I spent the past week reading about it. I believe in the American banks for more, I just think CS stock is pricing in a hellfire scenario.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-04-21 05:49:54", "id": "muxf8r"}
{"text": "\u200b not bad for a day's work I daytrade the fuck out of GME. It's not uncommon for me to make a tens of thousands, or today's case, nearly 200k. The stock is stupid volatile and follows the same fucking pattern EVERY SINGLE DAY. Do you ever wonder if all the people telling you to HODL might \\not\\ be on your side? If you, retail, lock up the float, the big boyz can also manipulate the price UP. Do you seriously think the shorts haven't managed their risk by now? For fuck's sake, you all post the DD here publicly. My biggest regret is not selling in the January spike; my second biggest was not selling in March. I rectified all that by just dumping it all and hopping in and out constantly. And before you say \"if he's in I'm in\"--you dummy, he already sold a portion of his assets and made millions. I can't wait for a \"maybe\" short squeeze. I want money now. Wasn't that the point of this sub? Have fun holding and getting worked up over literally nothing. \u200b EDIT regarding positions, from a comment I made below: 10M is the buying power from margin, so I have a fourth of that (3M). I started with 50k in November and grew it over the months (12 -> 20, 25 -> 40, 70 -> 210) and then started day trading positions from 2k - 10k from there. I usually mess around in the 5,000 share range, and only go 10,000+ if I need to average down. For example, if I bought 5,000 at 180, it falls to 170, I'll buy another 5,000 (putting me at 175), and then jump out at like 177. That's $20k right there. GME is so volatile in the bands and the good news is bullish so I'm usually not worried about the rug being pulled out from under me. I had bought at 175 I think last week and then just dumped it all today at 195, got back in at 189 and then dumped it again at 194.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-04-02 07:09:38", "id": "mi3v2s"}
{"text": "Technically it looks like a 5-star set up on a chart heading into their earnings today. Been in a channel for 8 months. Sitting at ATH's right now waiting for a reason to break out. A big earnings beat sends it higher or a split sends it higher. I bought calls before the split rumor so that would just icing on the cake. Anyone who thinks mega cap companies can't break out look at FB, up 7% today. I follow lots of hedge fund guys on Twitter and they're all sharing the same article of this hedge fund guy Bill Miller saying AMZN will double in Barron's and they're all just waiting for a reason to send it higher. [ If there's an earnings beat then over the next few weeks analyst after analyst will trip over each other upgrading their PT's which'll also send it higher. Analysts don't downgrade AMZN. They either keep their previous ratings or they upgrade. [ If we get any kind of good news Thursday AMZN will have $4k+ upside in the next month. $5k upside in the next 2 months. I've done a lot of time doing DD on this and I think it's a rate 5-star situation so I wanted to bring it to the fam. \ud83e\udd8d Haven't pitched an idea here before cuz this is the first really 5 star risk/reward bet I've found. I think calls are the move since we're either in for sideways or \ud83d\ude80\ud83c\udf15. As for the Split rumor, if it's true it would be huge. [ If there's a 6 to 1 or more split I bet we see +10% tomorrow even on average earnings. If we get an earnings beat plus a split then we're talking a once in a lifetime move for a biz their size - maybe 50% gains in the 1-2 months. Last time it consolidated this long the leg up was +100% and took 2-3 months. If they don't have numbers that get them there they will likely play the Split card. They know they need a breakout after the last 8 months and with a new CEO. Their last earnings was actually amazing but the stock didn't go because of the Bezos news. A big reason its stalled is the fact that it's 4k freaking dollars. A split means retail can jump in on shares & call options. A split isn't needed at all though for a break out. Keep in mind the split rumor isn't priced in. It popped 0.8% when the rumor broke and then settled back down later the same day. The last thing that needed to fall into place was yield expectations for the next month and Powell's meeting yesterday should help in that regard.

{"text": "This is going to be long - I have a lot to say, but you might as well read it otherwise you ape-fingered stock lovers will have to use those hairy appendages to crack open a real book and I think we all know nobody wants to do that. This is not strictly a financial analysis, this is an explanation of the psychedelic therapy industry. Any good book gives you the 5 Ws and an H so that will be the form of this post. Thank you in advance for reading, I hope people can gain some understandings from this and see the potential importance of these therapies. Again, to be clear, the industry will focus on the development of therapies from more than just psilocybin (LSD, MDMA, Ibogaine, DMT, Ketamine etc.) and it is not a recreational market. This is not investment advice...I just like getting high. (To be up front: I work as a researcher for a psychedelic therapy organization and I have a position in some of these companies - I won't name them as I got banned before for naming as most are under $1bn market cap - I will mention a few but I am not suggesting to invest in them, just hoping to provide some insight here) What is psilocybin/psychedelic therapy? It is important to understand what drugs/pharmaceuticals do...simply put they are a stimulus that elicits a response and alters the normal functioning of your brain, although your brain is likely not functioning \"normally\" if you are needing pharmaceuticals - all the technical aspects are unnecessary if you understand that (unless you want to know which drug will be most effective and why). Psilocybin therapy will look like molecular derivatives from the original psilocybe mushroom and its main compound (psilocybin) - this is necessary for the development of a pharmaceutical industry, otherwise Advil wouldn't be a successful drug (we need branding and ownership by way of patents). Our brain is a machine, finely tuned based on genetics and experience throughout life - this is how alcoholism can be inherited and also generated through substance use, many of these machines are not operating correctly and thus need some input to try and get it back to proper functionality (in dumb guy terms, when your big TV doesn't work and you smack it to make it run - the TV is your brain and the drug is the smack). It's all about serotonin baby - psilocybin specifically acts on our serotonergic receptors, it has an affinity for it, it also causes a cortical desynchronization amongst functionally connected regions - if you're fucked up, you probably have some bad connections up in that dome so psilocybin specializes in throwing off those connections and allowing new ones to form. This is why it works best in tandem with therapy...in the psychedelic state, many more states are possible and connections can form more freely, essentially allowing you to build a new bridge - whether you cross it or not is why the therapy helps (typical talk therapy, CBT, cognitive remediation and meditative practice are good options). The key to the success of this industry (and the therapy) is from turning this state into a trait. Why is it effective? Psilocybin specifically acts on a variety of brain regions that are key to everything from general cognition, self-understanding/referential thinking and our attentional networks (what you pay attention to is what you think). This therapy is very promising because of its ability to treat co-morbid disorders - if you are an alcoholic you are probably also depressed or anxious, usually you'd have to do some program for the alcoholism, or other addiction and maybe take a drug to counteract the physical effects of not having the substance, but you'd also need another drug for the depression - psilocybin is a one stop shop of sorts. It has been proven highly effective for improving addiction as well as the co-morbid disorders alongside that. Same goes for obesity, you're sort of addicted to food in some ways (although it isn't that simple, it is somewhat similar) and you're depressed because you look bad, you're anxious about disease as well due to your poor health...again multiple treatments needed to help one person. You can't just take a handful of mushrooms and suddenly your PTSD will disappear, that would simply just produce a state. We need to transform this state (or the operation of your brain at that time) into a trait (how your brain will typically operate). Because these disorders/diseases disrupt the functioning of your brain, you need something to alter it - namely a pharmaceutical, what the drug industry won't tell you is that everything alters your brain, something such as going on a walk, hanging out with a friend, listening to music or looking at art - all change your brain, but some brains are severely dysfunctional which is why drugs are needed (but they aren't the only thing needed). It is also important to understand that typical anti-depressant pharmaceuticals have a delayed action - which is good for making money but bad for treatment purposes (whereas something like ketamine therapy or psilocybin therapy do not have that same delay). TLDR; High level - psilocybin creates an overall cortical desynchronization that allows the brain to operate in a way it wouldn't normally, and leads to a potential shifting of functioning/connectivity between regions. Who does it help? Research is still young, as there was a large break in its study due to its legislative classification, but we know it is most effective for substance use disorders, obesity, acute stress disorder, PTSD, anxiety, treatment-resistant depression and more (with other potential uses to be discovered for the other substances). There are many companies that have different focuses (or business models) which is important for considering your investment - some focus on orphan diseases, obesity, Compass Pathways (this is over $1bn market cap so I can mention it) - treatment-resistant depression...go search it out yourself, but the most likely first use of this therapy will be for depression. There is also the potential for mental health issues that are not on the level of a disorder - you may be sad sometimes, or anxious others but it is not a consistent aspect of your existence. This scenario looks like a microdose (LET ME BE CLEAR - zero point zero research has been done on the effectiveness of microdosing, technically it isn't even a word as I get red squiggly's under it as I write, but if it is proven to have some effect you will see people taking these in a similar vein of Adderall or CBD pills with vitamin D - another potential market of psychedelics). The reason some doubt the effectiveness of a microdose is that it does not produce a psychedelic state (which is where the proverbial magic happens with psilocybin therapy), but if it has similar effects on similar brain pathways, a microdose could be a possible therapy and some do swear by it today - but again, there is NO research on the topic YET (another exciting potential for market growth however). TLDR; most people you lazy shit, this paragraph isn't that long just read it. Where is the money? THIS IS NOT A RECREATIONAL MARKET. Ok so as everyone knows, or should be aware of, the world is fucked - mental health issues are on the rise each year and it only continued to grow with the pandemic. For some quick maths we can add up the \"value\" or \"cost\" of the various disorders that psychedelics can treat (again more treatment uses will be available with further R&D). I'm just going to do a few to give you an example of the scale of this treatment, which is likely (although I'll be honest not proven) a more effective treatment. Mental health disorders will cost the global economy $16 trillion (USD) by 2030. ([ The total cost in the US alone of major depressive disorder (MDD) is estimated at $210 billion annually - this is not how much the treatment of the disorder is \"worth\" but rather how much it \"costs\" based on absenteeism (missing work) and presenteeism (lack of productivity at work) - caveat, I do wonder how exactly they calculate these so I don't swear by these numbers but it is a good estimate. (Businesses spend money not to lose money - keep that in mind) ([ Depression and anxiety cost the global economy $1 trillion (USD) annually due to lost productivity - important to recall that psilocybin itself can treat up to 5 disorders that we know of right now and the other psychedelics which are also part of the market will treat others in addition. ([ Global antidepressants market is expected to grow from $14.3 billion in 2019 to about $28.6 billion in 2020 and given the increased rates you can assume this number will continue to grow - this is only depression people, not all the other disorders/disease treatable by psychedelics. ([ Over the next 8 years (I believe this started in 2014) the US will have spent $4.2 trillion on treating obesity-related disease (remember that almost 40% of men and women in the US are considered obese), Germany will spend $390 billion, Brazil $251 billion and the UK $237 billion if nothing is done to try to prevent it (and not much has been). ([ Ok so as I am attempting to show here, a metric butt-ton is spent on various disorders/diseases that psilocybin could treat more effectively, and there is an even greater economic cost globally due to how these disorders/diseases impact productivity and availability (the best ability is availability baby). I said in my previous post that this could potentially (not this year, not in 5 years, but sometime in the future that I don't know) be a $200 billion industry and I believe that is a low estimate in all fairness. Seems insane, but I think the numbers show the severe cost of mental health disorders/diseases and the extremely high revenue of pharmaceutical companies off of these disorders. I am not going to make another estimate - I just gave some numbers which you can add up (and there are more numbers to be considered as I didn't mention all potential treatments) to devise the potential market and the costs associated with it. Again, people will spend money to not lose as much money. According to the WHO, every $1 spent on scaling up treatment will have a return of $4 in productivity - using my calculator, spending $4 trillion will reduce the global economic burden of mental health disorders. I must reiterate, there are many other drugs/compounds under investigation that fall under the category of psychedelics and those too will be used to help relieve this burden and acquire revenue. There will be money in the education behind this market - teaching medical students about its use, practitioners will need training etc...a variety of markets behind this as well. TLDR; Pathway to profitability - regulatory approval, clinics opened up for the specific purpose of psilocybin therapy, molecular derivative creation...testing...and patenting - leading to the creation of new pharmaceuticals to be sold to reduce the growing epidemic of mental health disorders and their extreme cost on the global economy. BUT THERE COULD BE A RECREATIONAL MARKET. Microdosing is another potential market for psilocybin specifically, which could open up another revenue stream - research is pending and studies are on the way but not yet. Just important to understand that there is potential market expansion with the lower doses vs. the higher therapeutic doses. How will the industry grow? Sadly, the industry will grow as mental health issues and global health issues do. As long as these kids keep tik-toking there will be a whole new generation of anxious, depressed and stressed people that need help. The cannabis industry needed legalization as the money will come from the recreational market - much like alcohol, they need it to be widely available to everyone (legalization is an arduous process), that is just a bonus for the psychedelic sector. This is a misunderstanding of the highest level to compare psychedelics to the cannabis industry, but I still anticipate people doing that in the comments, oh well...you can't fix stupid - but maybe psychedelics can! There is no need for legalization, it is all about the approval of health regulators - which is going well as the FDA last October granted breakthrough therapy designation to psilocybin for the treatment of depression...all is going in the right direction now. The industry will continue to grow (catalysts) with more research, funding and education (all 3 going hand in hand...the more research, the better the results, the more funding and the more education). There are still many other substances that have not been studied to great lengths and will likely prove to be effective as treatments for other disorders/diseases, yet again expanding the psychedelic therapy market (MDMA is already in late stage trials for the treatment of PTSD for example). TLDR; research, funding and education (of all the substances associated with the psychedelic therapy industry) When will this occur? (last one keep going, jesus this is long and I'm transcribing from a Word doc) Breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA is massive, similar approvals should continue as more trials/studies are completed. This is the toughest aspect to nail down - I can tell you that given the increased incidence rate of mental health disorders and diseases globally it will be sooner rather than later for psilocybin (and MDMA), the others will be later. Timeline for 1) making money and 2) getting this therapy available to the public: 1) Months ago you could have made money on a lot of these companies, so the sooner you get in the better (given the correct selection of organizations, you can do that research yourself but I will say MindMed (again over $1bn market cap) is not going to be a leader in the industry the way they are going, but you can still make money on them in the meantime). It is important to remember, not everyone in the industry now will be in it for the long run. 2) This is for global use, not just an American organization or a Western therapy...it is going to be used globally (I mean other than in China unless they go for some mind control type experiments a la the CIA with LSD) by most first-world countries that can afford the R&D and regulation - sorry my Russian comrades I don't think you count as first-world, but the others are and will be getting in on this. Now, this is not an investment strategy or advice. This has been a breakdown of the industry and its potential. How you play this market is up to you - maybe someone can devise a strategy and share with the others. It is extremely important to understand that the inevitability of further capital raising will impact the share price due to potential dilution. That is my one word of caution that has no bearing on the actual performance or potential of the industry, but it does impact your ability to maximize the bag - ensure you have a proper entry and exit strategy to avoid getting burned because there will be further capital raising. Best of luck - if you enjoyed this and somehow made it, throw an upvote on this bitch, this is my first in depth (and probably last) post so I hope that I have made some sense, shed some light and encouraged you about the potential of these therapies. If you think I'm an idiot or a hippie let me know in the comments and as I said before...I just like getting high. PEACE. EDIT: Thank you so much to everybody for the amazing feedback - I wrote this thinking not many people would care or that I would receive a lot of hate. I have been very touched by some of the stories shared and the overwhelming amount of comments!

{"text": "Hello Traders and Investors! What a week right?! So many stories and earnings! Here is my weekly recap which I share every Friday to help to wrap your head around these markets! Feel free to DM me any of your questions and happy trades! The S&P 500 opened at $4138.78 today, lower than its previous Friday\u2019s close of $4185.67 and its 52 week high of 4,191.31. Recovery from COVID has seen significant gains in the market as prices pull back from last week\u2019s all-time-highs. Reports released Thursday that President Biden could propose a capital gains tax increase to 39.6% on individuals earning $1 million dollars or more, nearly double the current nominal rate of 20%. Additionally, a 3.8% investment tax currently exists to fund Obamacare. This potentially pushes the tax rate 43.4% which conflicts with long standing tax practices that have historically seen investment income lower than labor taxes. Such an increase seeks to address long standing notions of wealthy individuals paying lower tax rates than middle and low-income workers, a sentiment that President Biden campaigned on and championed. Members of the GOP suggest the increase will halt economic growth, leading those affected to hoard assets in order to avoid the tax. It is unclear if these claims will hold water, as historically there has been a low correlation between increases to the capital gains tax and the market. In 2013 the S&P experienced stellar growth of 30% despite an increase to capital gains tax of over 86%. Jobless claims dropped more than 7% from last week according to the Labor Department. This coincides with robust gains in the market as a whole as the country recovers from last year\u2019s COVID pandemic. Current job loss from pre-COVID era still hovers around 8 million. Increase in national vaccine rollouts, averaging 3 million per day, should expedite this recovery. Approximately 40% of Americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Several major travel companies reported earnings this week. This includes American Airlines, United Airlines, Royal Caribbean. The International Air Transport Association has commented on the situation, citing potential losses in the sector of $48 Billion for the 2021 fiscal year. These numbers are over a 25% increase from previously released estimates of $38 Billion. Although significant, losses are down significantly from last year, where the industry suffered a $126.4 Billion loss in the wake of COVID shutdowns. American Airlines posted dismal earnings of -$5.54 per share Thursday. A spokesperson for American Airlines said the company is spending around $30 Million per day in operations costs, despite reducing annual operating costs by $1.3 Billion. The company continues to consolidate and revealed it expects to reduce its workforce by 1,600 in the coming months. In addition, American Airlines reportedly reached a deal with Boeing to delay delivery of twenty-three 737 jets for up to 3 years. American Airlines posted revenue of 4.01 Billion, just under half of it\u2019s posted revenue only a year ago. Airports are functioning at around 60% of their capacity. \"We continued to excel in growing customer relationships in our market focus areas of mobility, fiber and HBO Max,\" said AT&T CEO John Stankey in reference to a favorable Q1 Earnings report for the communications giant. Q1 Earnings reports reveal an excellent quarter for the company, who continues to grow in cell-service subscribers. AT&T also posted favorable results for its HBO Max service, which it received in its 2018, $85 Billion acquisition of Time Warner. A Tesla vehicle was involved in a fatal crash that killed two people over the weekend. The car was suspected to have been functioning on Autopilot by investigators as it was found with no occupant in the driver\u2019s seat. Tesla has revealed that they have no data that suggests the vehicle was on Autopilot during the crash at this time Tesla did not rule out the possibility that further investigation may reveal the vehicle was in-fact on autopilot, but declined to make any additional comments at this time. Discord, a popular chat application developed for gamers, has ended months-long acquisition talks with tech giant Microsoft. Market Valuation of Discord has skyrocketed to $10 Billion from last year\u2019s June valuation of $3.5 Billion. This comes at a time where many social media platforms are looking to develop and integrate chat functions in a way to capture user engagement and capitalize on the increase in remote work. Discord now intends to stay independent and pursue an IPO. The decision by Discord comes as Salesforce looks to acquire Slack in Q2 \u201821 for $27 Billion. Slack operates a chatroom not unlike Discord, but targeted at businesses as opposed to consumers. The acquisition is currently pending a U.S. Justice Department probe that will determine whether or not it will continue. Microsoft's attempted acquisition of Discord on the heels of Slack\u2019s pending acquisition is likely a response to increased competition for Microsoft from Salesforce in the B2B and B2C technology markets. Netflix reached 208 million subscribers in Q1, just missing its projection of 210 million. The tech giant blames this miss on societal normalization as COVID regulations ease and more people return to work. Quarantine mandates saw a massive increase of 16 million new subscribers in the early months, and just over 10 million between April and June of 2020. In contrast, January through April of 2021 saw only 4 million new subscribers. Regardless, the streaming giant reported an earnings per share of $3.75, versus $1.57 the year prior, which beat Wall Street predictions. Netflix\u2019s 2020 subscriber boom showed massive financial gains in revenue, operating income, and operating margin. Q2 forecasts project a slight correction to this growth due to job growth and general societal rebound. Some of the companies who reported earnings this week: Monday, April 19th: Coca-Cola Co.: $0.55 IBM Corp.: $1.77 United Airlines: -$7.50 Tuesday, April 20th: Johnson and Johnson: $2.32 Procter and Gamble: $1.63 Netflix: $3.75 Phillip Morris: $1.57 Lockheed Martin: $6.56 Wednesday, April 21st: Progressive: $1.72 Verizon: $1.27 Chipotle: $5.36 Equifax: $1.97 Nasdaq: $1.73 Discover: $5.04 Halliburton: $0.19 Baker Hughes: $0.12 Thursday, April 22nd: Intel $1.39 Snap $0.00 Biogen $5.34 Southwest Airlines -$1.72 VeriSign $1.33 Quest Diagnostics $3.76 Boston Beer Company $5.26 American Airlines -$4.32", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-04-24 01:42:42", "id": "mwwt2h"}

{"text": "Please read these two previous posts before you shit on my positions 1st Post US approval of JnJ vaccine and additional orders of MRNA and PFE* \\- The US at this point is pretty loaded with vaccine doses, we have enough as it is without NVAX to vaccinate all the US. This leads to the common misconception that NVAX is too late to the party and has missed out. However, the US is still going to purchase 110 million doses from NVAX no matter what once it is approved. The deal is already made. The US gov funded NVAX to get these doses they will not just refuse to buy them. Despite this I still insist the US market share DOES NOT MATTER. Here are a list of other deals NVAX has lined up SHIT TONS EU deal talks with NVAX fall apart citing manufacturing concerns - OK this one sounds bad I admit. Could it be? NVAX can't actually secure enough of its raw materials to make vaccines for the EU? If they can't even do that how are we supposed to expect them to be able to make vaccines for the rest of the world? The truth is that NVAX was the one that refused to sign the deal with the EU. As demonstrated in this article Insider selling \\- If you sell your positions when you see a headline about an insider selling stock you should really reconsider this investing hobby thing and go into buying beanie babies or whatever the fuck you feel more comfortable with because you'll never make money or be able to hug your kids with such fragile paper hands. Execs sell their stock all the time, they schedule selling months ahead of time or just want the money. In fact, NVAX execs were selling their stock at $125 just days before Phase 3 data came out that sent NVAX to $300+. It simply has not been indicative of catastrophic news. 4) General market pullback \\- As many of you are aware the market has been extremely rocky in March and NVAX is not immune to this. In fact, being such a high beta stock it is more vulnerable. Biotech has been absolutely slammed by the market in March which makes this a PERFECT buying opportunity. \u200b Now onto the good stuff - two catalysts I expect this month: 1) UK Approval - NVAX has completed its UK Phase 3 trial and the results look GREAT. At 96% efficacy it's the best performing vaccine reported to date. It already had submitted data to the UK as part of a rolling review and should get the approval by the end of April US Phase 3 Results - This will likely take investors by surprise! NVAX enrolled their phase 3 trial in record time which allowed them to get started much earlier than anticipated. Additionally, with 30,000 participants this trial is much larger than the UK trial and they will likely reach their endpoint targets in much less time than what the UK trial took. In fact, this US phase 3 trial started crossover studies This stock has gone through tremendous de-risking. At $180 a share NVAX is almost down to the price it was before Phase 3 data came out. It can't fall much more, and at a market cap of 12.9 Bn it is grossly undervalued. 2) Other covid developements - a) NVAX announced in their earnings call that SA variant trials would begin by the start of the summer and that these would be solely safety-based. If the original vaccine is approved for efficacy these would not have to demonstrate such rigorous efficacy data. b) NanoFlu+Covid or NanoFlu+Covid+RSV vaccine trials are supposed to start by the end of the year.

{"text": "This post is in continuation of this was the company with the most growth in mentions. But, the average sentiment across the mentions was negative given the 50% drop in valuation. The stock had crossed the $100 mark on 22nd March 2021 and has lost more than 50% of its value since then. The market had been over-enthusiastic about the stock since the beginning of 2021 due to its effort of transforming to a streaming giant from a traditional cable media company. However, this enthusiasm was short-lived. There might be some scope for a short-term rebound. ASO* was also growing in mentions due to their stellar earnings report. The company reported Revenues were US$5.7b, approximately in line with what analysts expected. (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$3.79, an impressive 41% ahead of estimates. Humanigen(HGEN) reported phase 3 results of Lenzilumab\u2122 stating it improves survival without the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The stock jumped 100% on Monday and has stabilized at around 34% increase from last week. MicroVision(MVIS) stock soared 50% on Wednesday. This is mainly due to Microsoft receiving a U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets. (It's estimated to be worth $21.9B over the next 10 years). There has been a lot of rumors stating Microsoft is planning to buy MicroVision which predominantly drove the discussions on MVIS. FUBO stock price has been on a continuous decline for the last 2 months (more than 50% drop) and there is now increasing chatter on whether it is oversold or on the path to a rebound SOME FAQ\u2019s: How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative). What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyze financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.

{"text": "Hi Everyone, I have been a retard on here for almost a year. Mostly just a lurker and upvoter but decided to start doing some DD. Looking forward to feedback and discussion on this stock.

Moreover, it ensures funds are set aside for infrastructure on tribal lands and that tribal nations are consulted in program administration.

Short Squeeze Possibility According to fintel [ Short Interest as of 3/15 is 7.49% However, days to cover is at 4.18 due to low volume in this stock. If 85% of the float is owned by institutions, that means 85% of 225 million is about 191 million. Which leaves about 34 million shares remaining. If we say only 1 million WSB subscribers actually are active and have money to spend, they could potentially grab hold of the free float market share 1 Million x 34 shares each ($383) = free float capture = squeeze. Not to mention the options market and a gamma squeeze possibility. If you look at the options chain there is only 2,216 open call contracts which expire 4/16. And there are open contracts available in $1 increments and are dirt cheap ($5). So a couple hundred thousand contracts OTM ($12 - $20) spaced out evenly by some retards definitely has the potential for a wicked gamma squeeze. \\\u200b 5.

It bounced up and down all day basically from $11.00 to $11.15 extremely consistently until about 12:30 when the price rocketed from $11.00 to $11.28 at close. Now, this could've been shorts covering, or people getting ready knowing it's about to take off soon. The last minute of the ticker saw some wicked buy orders of about 250k shares. [ \\\u200b \\\u200b TL;DR UNIT looks like a solid fundamental investment, backed by Smart money like Blackrock, Vanguard, and Michael Burry. In addition the American Jobs Plan provides a tremendous opportunity for this company to grow it's fiber optic network and leaseback opportunities. On top of that, a squeeze play is also quite possible, both with short squeeze and gamma squeeze potential. It may be boring but growth looks like it's fading and value is becoming the name of the game.* \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-04-03 06:11:02", "id": "mir9fp"}

{"text": "TLDR; Gamestop is undervalued considering its online sales numbers and ecommerce focus - analysts haven\u2019t caught up yet from Q4 Earning report; add on top of that all the hiring of Amazon execs and VPs and Gamestop Valuation is about to explode upward. On its current trajectory $550-750 a share is a reasonable (my worthless opinion) price point, with or without the squeeze. Not only is buying GME a play on the squeeze, but also a deep fucking value bet. Fair warning, you'll develop a wrinkle of two if you proceed... but don\u2019t worry my fellow ape brethren I\u2019ve included charts, with colors, to make visualization easy. Let\u2019s walk through these figures one by one and tell the story of Gamestop\u2019s transition. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\Edit\\ also see latest update (4/1): Our Whale is Suppressing Volatility to Bleed HFs -- Max Pain Explained, as it faced the challenges all brick and mortar stores faced: theft of sales to the e-commerce giants -- the convenience of online downloads and pre-ordering on the internet. In the last two years, this loss has come down significantly. And what impresses me most about Gamestop is their cash on hand (currently $635M). Very few stores with operating losses have that level of cash. Most are in debt, and require the sale of shares to float by during rough times. \u200b And this is the key misstep the HF\u2019s made in shorting Gamestop. There has been a stigma out there about brick and mortar stores going under (Toys R Us, and Sears as example)... feeding frenzy, blood in the water you get the point. Sharks (HFs) have been getting more and more bold (reckless) in their targeting. Gamestop was the wrong target, for a very specific reason. It leases its stores. By comparison, consider Walmart needing to reduce stores, or Target. They\u2019ve built massive buildings with parking lots to house their very specific store needs (huge upfront costs, sunk), and they rent (or own) these buildings under much different contracts. They can\u2019t easily get up and leave one of their stores. Ask yourself, how would Walmart leave a store? Who would buy it? How could the investor renting to them turn it into something else? Maybe a city might want it to build an expo center. On the cheap. WalMarts costs are priced into this (it\u2019s expensive). They can\u2019t move as easily. Point being, Gamestop doesn\u2019t owe anything to shut down a store, it simply stops paying its lease and moves all it\u2019s stuff out. They rent strip mall locations and mall storefronts. This allows them to liquidate stores and downsize with little to no sunk costs. They can also reposition themselves much more efficiently. This is why we see this fast turn-around in Operating Loss last year (a major component of Operating Loss is storefront costs for Brick and Mortar). News of Gamestop closing stores isn\u2019t bad news. Remember that. The media will try to sell it as such. Because of the focus, Gamestop is eyeing Digital Sales, for its future. # Chapter 2: Digital Sales Growth It is clear to everyone, at this point, that Gamestop is looking to move a large portion of its business into the online space. In 2020 Gamestop did $580Million in sales online, and in Q4 alone their online sales represented over 34% of all Gamestop sales; Gamestop did more in online sales in the 4th quarter of 2020 than it did in all of 2019. \u200b So what caused this? Ryan fucking Cohen. And he\u2019s just getting started. When we see the sales in 2021 first quarter compared to 2020 the trajectory of this massive shift will become even more apparent. We have only to look at Chewy\u2019s online sales figures under Cohen to project what\u2019s to come for Gamestop in the next few years. \u200b That\u2019s right, Chewy grew from $205M in online sales to $3,500M (17x) in 3 years under Cohen. Gamestop Announced in it\u2019s Q4 earnings report last week what it\u2019s intentions are... \u201cOur emphasis in 2021 will be on improving our E-Commerce and customer experience, increasing our speed of delivery, providing superior customer service and expanding our catalogue.\u201d Which brings us to our next chapter on the entire Electronics & Media space in ecommerce -- let's make sense of what potential exists for growth in this sector... \u200b # Chapter 3: Electronics & Media Sales If you ever wondered where Amazon makes all it\u2019s money. Look no further than the category of Electronics & Media (Gaming, computers, electronics, digital media). In 2020 the company did 120.9 Billion in sales, and 54.6% of that fell into this category. There are plenty of other players in this space, but only Apple is close to Amazon\u2019s market share. Here is a chart to visualize the largest players (Gamestop is #10 currently with their 2020 sales, the tiny orange slice): \u200b Amazon itself projects this space to grow 34.2% in the next two years. Meaning roughly $40B in new Electronics and Media sales will emerge in the online space for these companies to grow into over the next two years. Might be a good time to mention that Gamestop listed GPUs for sale on it\u2019s website earlier this week, and they sold out instantly. With Gamestop doing $580M in online sales in 2020, and most of that coming in Q4 it is safe to say Gamestop is positioned to grab onto this space in a way that will shake Amazon\u2019s growth models for the next two years. Have you noticed how Ryan Cohen is leaning on his Amazon (and Chewy) relationships to pull talent to go after this space. If chewy is any indication, I wouldn\u2019t bet against him eventually grabbing a large percentage, even the majority, of it. So let\u2019s get to the fun part\u2026 valuation \u200b # Chapter 4: What is Gamestop Worth? Valuations are a funny thing. Companies are only worth what people think someone else will pay for it in the future. Often we start with fundamentals, but in the end, hype and excitement over growth and continued growth leads to higher and higher valuations. I\u2019ll start with a simple comparison just to prove a point. Gamestop ($12B Market Cap) and Roblox ($36B Market Cap)\u2026 we\u2019re all gamers here, right? We know what Roblox is, right? Two completely different companies, but let\u2019s look at the figures anyway and then I\u2019ll get back to comparing GME to the online retail giants. Roblox did $920Million in revenue in 2020 (up from $435Million in 2019), and it\u2019s valuation rose from $4B to $36B. Hmmm\u2026 why? Well, it went public. IPO is a great way to hype a stock. Get people excited, maximize valuation, so those angel investors can finally get paid off. So how does this compare to Gamestop (minus the hype of an IPO). Well Gamestop did $6,466Million in revenue in 2020. Yep, seven times what Roblox did? So why the major difference in Market Cap? Well for one, Roblox has very few employees and no stores to spend money on (is this tickling that little feeling you have about Gamestop\u2019s move to becoming primarily an online ecommerce giant, it should be). If Gamestop were valued the same as Roblox, right now\u2026 it would move it\u2019s price to approximately $5,157 a share. That\u2019s not a squeeze number. That\u2019s simply an IPO hyped valuation number on growth. Gamestop is moving that direction, minus the IPO, but they are aiming to grow (like Chewy did). \u200b So let\u2019s get a better comparison to the other giants. Apple, Amazon Chewy, Target, Walmart and Best Buy. I\u2019ve chosen these because they represent a wide range of Brick and Mortar vs ecommerce. Price to Sales Ratio is calculated by dividing the company's market capitalization by the revenue, this gives a general sense of how much the market is going to value a company relative to its revenue. Value players (like Buffet) are often looking for the lowest P/S ratio to enter for a fundamentally solid company, and companies with a lot of growth potential and hype can grow their P/S ratio (similar to P/E ratio) to levels that are very high. One thing you\u2019ll notice in this chart. The more online a company is, the higher it\u2019s P/S ratio can go. This directly impacts the Valuation of the company. While companies that may be online, but still rely most heavily on their stores, have a lower P/S because they have a lot of overhead costs. You\u2019ll notice Gamestop in the middle, because it\u2019s transitioning to ecommerce. Last year you would have seen Gamestop with a P/S similar to Best Buy and Walmart. The reason this is important is because as Gamestop grows it\u2019s online business, it\u2019s P/S is likely to rise, and moving to the Amazon level would represent a share price of roughly double what we currently see for Gamestop, while not changing anything about it fundamentals. \u200b # Final Chapter: Conclusions Ok you\u2019ve been patient, and I told you I\u2019d eventually get to what Gamestop is worth currently, and next year (projection). What the market hasn\u2019t caught onto yet, that we all see in Gamestop is it\u2019s deep fucking value. So what is Gamestop worth, right now? Well $191, that\u2019s what it\u2019s trading at. It\u2019s only worth more, when people see these numbers and get excited about them. The numbers show that Gamestop is growing exponentially with its online sales and Ryan has brought on a team to accelerate that growth. I don\u2019t know what Q1 numbers are, but I can guess a lot of Apes, are really excited about Gamestop, and becoming more and more loyal to its brand. I know I wouldn\u2019t buy anything from Amazon, that I could get from Gamestop right now, even if it costs slightly more. It\u2019s because of quality, and support for the brand. Lots of things are increasing Gamestop\u2019s valuation, but growth of it\u2019s online sales will be the most significant one. What most analysts are ignoring (or simply missing, if I\u2019m giving them some credit) is just how massive Gamestop\u2019s online sales growth were last year, despite the pandemic. If we project Q4 numbers onto 2021, and ignored the dream team Cohen has brought on board, one can expect 3-4 times as much in online sales next year. That will tip P/S higher and people will stop seeing Gamestop as a failing brick and mortar and recognize it for what it is\u2026 an Amazon killer, going after an $88B market in Electronics & Media by 2023. On top of that, growing an esports brand (I suspect) that will engulf a $200B annual industry that is likely to only grow to $300B by 2023. Project these figures onto Gamestop as you\u2019d like. I\u2019ll take a stab at it. Right now Gamestop should be valued at $662 a share, based on it\u2019s Q4 figures and projection into 2021 from it\u2019s finish in 2020 Q4. By this time in 2023, we will see Gamestop at a $50B valuation from $12.5B in sales, and a P/S in the 4.0 ballpark - that puts it\u2019s per share price at $795 - conservatively without hyper on the growth (that you know will amplify that by another factor of 2-3). How do we justify a growth from 580M to $12.5B in two years\u2026 Ryan fucking Cohen is how. Multiple current sales by 17. Go back and look at that Chewy graph if you\u2019re wondering how that\u2019s possible. There is a gaping hole in the Electronics ecommerce side of the market, growing. Amazon and Gamestop can both grow incredibly without stealing from one another\u2026 I have another DD in the works on The Squeeze (no dates, no times) and a look at how high we might go (spoiler, there is no accurate answer, but there is a lot to look at, and be excited about to try to make educated guesses). Here is a teaser\u2026 When Volkswagen Squoze, it temporarily became the most valuable company in the world. Gamestop doing the same, would put it\u2019s price north of $31,800 on it\u2019s way to the moon (not that we heard a bell yet as we flew by that mark). If you needed one more reason to HODL, it\u2019s this\u2026 you will be at least 4 times richer a few years from now, even if you went into a Comma and your wife\u2019s boyfriend lost your password couldn\u2019t get to that sell button on the way down from the squeeze, because at $191 a share, GME is still a deep fucking value play squeeze aside. And if you\u2019ve ever wondered how Phineas and Ferb pay for their projects\u2026 I think I figured it out \u200b Please Be Good To Each Other Out There. Behind these names we are all humans and we all have our own stories. If you need one more reason to HODL -- I have (had) a terminally ill child (no I do not want anything from any of you) that has a life expectancy of 25ish (she's 9). She survived what was estimated as a 1 in 1000 chance of making it (nine operations and three open heart surgeries as an infant-toddler), which is why she qualified and received a wish from Make-A-Wish (the best damn organization I could have ever hoped for). I have to also give the largest kuddos to this community. On the r/ PoGo board, when I posted about my daughters acceptance by Make-A-Wish to follow her dream of living our Pokemon Go in real life, this community was a critical part of making all that magic come to life. From volunteers who attended the event (400+ costumed members) to connections that got in touch with the animation team in Japan (they drew her a special sketch and all signed the back). Niantic also put UNOWNs of her name into her account after one beautiful soul reached out to someone high up in the org to tell them my daughters story. Why do I bring this up? I want to give my daughter the ability to live out her retirement when she's 18. Travel the world. Experience as much as she can. If you need one more reason to HODL GME... I'm not selling until I can give her that. Don\u2019t lose who you are in the wealth that may (or maybe not) suddenly fall into your lap based on your investing performances. I see mostly fucking amazing souls in this crowd of Apes. Let\u2019s make the world a better place. Not financial advice. I don\u2019t know how the stock market works. I don\u2019t know how companies or their fundamentals work. I bashed the keyboard a bunch of times and this popped out. The only thing I know for certain, is I bake a mean crayon pie.

{"text": "So what do you guys do to improve your trading game? I've been using a notebook and keeping track of my trades and writing down what worked and what didn't, as well as coming up with rules to follow to stop myself from repeating mistakes I see more than once. For example, I've discovered that my biggest weakness is that my prime animal isn't a bear or a bull, it's a pig. I've missed the direction of a trade exactly three times in the last year, but I've lost money on dozens of trades that I went from green to red on because I refused to accept that the top was in. This had led to realized losses of over $7k - small potatoes to some of you, big potatoes to others. And remember, at one point, I was up on basically every single one of those trades, so the losses counting unrealized and never taken gains are much, much worse. I've realized the reason for this is that while the trade is still open, I feel like I'm proving to myself and the world that I'm smart enough to figure out something, and closing the trade by taking profit means I've given up on my idea or admitted it's wrong - nonsensical, I know, but you've got to figure out why you're doing foolish behaviors if you want to stop them. Since then I've started to set stop sales and it's really helped me to take profits and improve my skills (and portfolio), because once I'm no longer emotionally invested in being \"right\" as I've already taken profit I can much more easily analyze how the equity or trend is doing going forwards, and whether or not it's something I'm happy staying out of or if I want to get back into it at the current price. My next step is figuring out when to abandon losing positions instead of riding them to zero and starting to make successful hedges on my positions. How about you? What are your biggest weaknesses and how are you working to address them and improve?

We can do this. * BLACKROCKAGEDDON Up too late last week, I found this odd-sounding article titled Clean Energy ETF May See Big and the $7bn iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN). You\u2019re probably thinking \u201c...oh...um...okay. Whatever?\u201d Well, let me break this Greek down. These BlackRock ETFs (INRG and ICLN) track the S&P Clean Energy Index, and because the index hasn\u2019t been updated in 14 years, it only has 30 holdings. The new rule proposal means that ICLN/INRG (the BlackRock ETFs) will be required to expand from 30 tickers...to 100...right now. So, BlackRock currently owns WAY too disproportionate a weight in a small basket of stocks that got pumped during the Biden boom post-election (see: PLUG). The BlackRock ETFs currently have a stake of 8% or more of EACH of almost a quarter of the stocks in the Index. This rebalance means that on a massive scale and in a specified time frame, ICLN and INRG are compelled to sell and buy hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stake in EACH of the companies already in the index it follows, AND they would PURCHASE initiating stakes in up to 67 other companies. -ICLN TOP TEN HOLDINGS. SO. MUCH. PLUG. I found a document from SPDJI called a \u201cconsultation\u201d that lays out the process. would need to pump more than $400m into each of Vestas Wind Systems, Orsted and NextEra Energy, as well as large sums into Chinese groups such as China Longyuan Power, Xinjiang Goldwind and GCL-Poly Energy. >This buying spree would be counterbalanced by a wave of disposals. The ETFs would need to sell $405m worth of stock in New Zealand\u2019s Meridian Energy, SocGen estimated, equivalent to 47.6 days of typical turnover. >For the US-listed American depositary receipts of Brazil\u2019s Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais, the implied selling of $248m of stock would represent 57.7 per cent of the free-float market capitalisation, SocGen said. Whoa! This is a lot of critical information. Recap: What we know: On 4/19, The S&P Clean Energy Index is undergoing a massive overhaul and adding 67 fresh stonks. BlackRock ETFS ICLN and INRG track this index, and will therefore participate in a frenzy of buying and selling on/before/around that date. On 4/2 the pro-formas are released indicating the weighting and therefore candidates. What else we know: New purchases and redistributions--LITERAL pumps and dumps--are a requirement for the BlackRock ETFs. According to SocGen, this includes among others: $400m pump for NEE, and extreme dumps for CEG and others. Pumps and dumps so large that they represent 40-50 days of the stocks natural trading cycle. What we\u2019re pretty damn sure of: My mans G has been helping me out with some digging. We are pretty damn sure PLUG will go down HARD once BlackRock divests to spread the wealth. NEE is a guaranteed add (BLNK not applicable thanks /u/sirajgb) We are also looking at VST as an addition to the index based on call flow and fundamentals. What we\u2019ll do: Next week we\u2019ll give some winners and losers. I will keep calling SocGen (sometimes with fake accents to be more convincing), trying to get the report. For now, we are looking for clean-energy infrastructure excitement to provide a run on these stocks this week, making it even more juicy to grab some quick shorties. ELI5/TLDR: BlackRock ETFs ICLN and INRG have to buy and sell a bunch of stocks due to the indexes those ETFs track undergoing a massive overhaul. It will cause major volatility, produce some big winners, and some even bigger losers. Next week I\u2019ll have more picks.

{"text": "There are a few outliers that have particularly showed up today that causes me some concern. 1. \u2060We had a slew of great data on the economic front. Record high job momentum. Possibly new spending on infrastructure. A populous looking to spend money. All of this is a positive but the market tanked over the last two days. The 10-year yields haven\u2019t moved either which is definitely worrying. You should be very worried that they haven\u2019t moved. What this is saying is that in lieu of rates not moving, the market has already priced in the economic boom. So there isn\u2019t much upside left. 2. \u2060Main Street boom will happen without a hitch. The market went up last year because it factored that in. If you remember 2020, people lost jobs and government fiscal and monetary policy alleviated what COULD have happened in 2021, 2022, and 2023. It was not for only 2020. 3. \u2060QE was start tightening much more rapidly than you expect. A stronger stranglehold over the Fed\u2019s purse means the cost of borrowing goes up and business expansion slows down, leading to shrinking margins for high growth stocks that have already been projected. This means that companies will not hit their estimate earnings and reduce their stock price. The market is frothy. You all had a good ride, but there is more downward pressure on stock performance at this point. The economy will boom. We will see a mouthwatering GDP growth. But consider that the stock market is overweight on high growth tech and other bubbles. When it sells, it\u2019ll ruin the whole bunch. This impending collapse will only correct stocks while Main Street will have their time in the Sum. Edit: CORRECTION- The market did not tank over the last two days. However, intraday trading is hovering around ATH for the past two days with a booming economy looming on the horizon. If it hasn\u2019t moved up since then, it\u2019s deciding where to go.

{"text": "Alrighty retards, I've been here since late January and I am amazed at how little chatter there is about Disney right now. There's 3 key things that make me super bullish about it, and I'm gonna try to break them down without any of that technical jargon that you need to be actually smart to understand. Disney+, Disney Parks, and their merchandise. So! let's start with the easiest one to dive into: # THE THEME PARKS: In 2019, Disney parks generated 6.7 BILLIONS in income, a little over 40% of their entire revenue. With the pandemic, park attendance obviously plummeted, and several closed. At the time of writing this, only 3 of the 6 parks globally are open, with one (Disney California) set to re open by the end of the month with reduced capacity (around 25% of the max). With Biden's plan to have everyone able to be vaccinated soon, that capacity is going to back up to max, and as the entire world recovers the other parks go back to normal too. with every park going back up, there's gonna be a massive bump in income. That's before you consider that most everyone has been locked up for over a year now, and I am willing to bet my left nut that somewhere some little timmy and billy have been begging their middle class mommy and daddy to go to Disney. I wouldn't be surprised if we see record attendance numbers for these parks this year. But wait, there's more! There is an Avengers themed area set to open in June this year, and Galaxy's Edge, the Star Wars themed section of the American Parks, opened May 31, 2019 to rave reviews! Given the new Star Wars content being announced and published, attractions like these are going to continue to expand and draw people with new experiences. You can build your own lightsaber there, for $200! and that ties into... # THE MERCHANDISE: Disney sells a LOT of shit. I mean, a fucking lot. Star Wars alone has entire series of novels, comic books, video games, apparel, and even a convention (Star Wars Celebration) . And since the Sequel trilogy has ended, Disney has moved Star Wars into a new era: The High Republic. Primarily as books and comics, this era is 200 years before the mainline series. They have CENTURIES of timeline to play with, and without the restraints of existing material to confine them. The Clone Wars is only a roughly 3 year period in the lore, and the amount of shit that happens in that period is insane. Disney is going to milk this period for as much as they can, with some speculation they may bring in some fan favorite characters from Star Wars Legends (canon before Disney bought the rights and erased 90% of the timeline), namely Darth Revan. I won't get into it too much, but Revan alone is a huge draw for Star Wars Fanatics. Marvel is also killing it with comic books and collectibles, but my knowledge is admittedly less in depth on the MCU stuff, merch wise. The universe, though? \u200b # DISNEY+: Disney+ is an absolute gold mine that Disney is sitting on. They have exclusive access to two of the biggest IP's, period, with Star Wars and the MCU, and both are built on movies and tv shows. With how the Netflix MCU shows have had the rights revoked, the onslaught of new shows (Wandavision, Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Clone Wars season 7, Bad Batch, The Mandalorian, Book of Boba Fett, Kenobi...) Disney is setting itself up to keep those subscriber numbers up by slow feeding the horde of fans with content. Add in how they've been doing movie releases on the platform with Mulan, where you paid an additional $30 to access the brand new movie, and how that model has also been confirmed for the upcoming Black Widow and Cruella films, and it's a safe assumption that Disney is gearing the platform up to be a theatre alternative. why go buy a movie ticket and drive to theater, deal with a noisy crowd, and not be able to pause the movie when you can just buy it from home and watch it? This is likely going to happen for the entire future of the MCU. The big ace up the sleeve though, is the Fox library. Remember that Disney bought out Fox not too long ago? They have nearly all Fox content now on Disney+. X-men, Avatar (blue aliens, not the cartoon) Night at the Museum, etc are all Disney now. In short, Disney is STACKED to make a killing these next few years, but especially this year.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-04-17 12:28:10", "id": "msh8uj"}

Also he did mention MindMed to Cathie Wood in a four panel interview on CNBC a week or two ago.

{"text": "What\u2019s up, been a lurker on this subreddit for a while- even used to have a flair back in the day, but this is my first DD - this is not financial advice I have one too many chromosomes for that. SPCE has announced they will be launching their next test flight in may 2021. Historically SPCE has rallied before test flights, and then plummeted back to earth faster than their shitty failed launches. The stock price has taken a beating recently, as with many other growth stocks, it is down 50% since Feb 11th. I believe this presents a tasty opportunity, and I think it is probable the stock will rally in a similar manner as it has done in the past when a test date is announced. The play here is to buy calls for either May if you are feeling brave, or June if you want a degree of freedom with dates. You can hold the calls through the test flight if you want to risk it for the biscuit, but the safer play is probably to sell before the test as SPCE have been fucking up their test flights. There is a part of me that believes that this next launch is crucial for the success of SPCE as a company, and that they will be highly unwilling to allow another failed test. Therefore, I am inclined to believe the test will be a positive result- but that is more of my personal feeling not based on facts and could be a prime example of gamblers fallacy. If the launch is successful then calls could print bigly. Bear Case: SPCE already up 91% YTD and is a growth stock which can get fucked harder then your mother by a sector rotation to value. Also, there may be low confidence in SPCE as investors are tired of failed launches, this may limit the pre test runup. Also, there has been no firm date set for the launch- if there are continued problems then the options may expire before the rally. Finally, for those of you who eat crayons, the 1YR chart does somewhat represent a head and shoulders pattern, if SPCE falls below $26 there could be problems- personally I think technical analysis has about as much merit as palm readings and I\u2019m not too concerned about this. Positions: 30 X JUN 18 $34 calls - will likely sell half in the run up and hold out half in the hopes the launch will be successful.

Drunken ape me decided mac and cheese was worth it's weight in gold while drunk one night and bought in. Up 250% in a month or 2. ____________________________ So I'm sure everyone has seen the news on national ketchup shortage. In the past when news like this broke like the toilet paper situation. The toilet paper stocks rocketed. Sanitizer shortages, same thing. KHC was green today, but really not that great and low on volume. Any ideas on why the small price action? Just sensory overload, and it was overlooked? This stock is top 5 in Buffet's and Burry's portfolio. The company has made all the right moves in terms of paying down debt and making the momentum go the right direction as of late. I'm thinking that being that we are sitting at a 52 week high there is a mental resistance line to cross. However if you remove that it really looks like this stock price is just ready to take off. Some interesting catalyst I noticed there has been over $65 million in block purchases made. I'm not an expert on these but I couldn't see any other block purchases anywhere near this size on khc in recent past. (If I'm wrong on this, please show me where to find it.) Assuming that Burry has exercised his call options or will rather than selling, Buffets giant position, the block purchases today, the consistent upwards momentum, the increase in demand and profitability on the ketchup packets. Things look really really good on this company. When first researching this stock I really didn't fully understand all of the fundamentals that have been falling in place over the last year to get us to this point. I looked at this stock as a great hedge if and when the market crashes as consumers rotate back into home cooked meals and groceries with less eating out to save money. I see this article and it was the final piece of the puzzle for me. If we have another wave of covid,. KHC goes up. If everything opens up, KHC goes up. If stock market keeps ripping and roaring, KHC goes up. Market and economy crash, KHC goes way up. Extremely Bullish on this company. I am certainly no expert but I love this brand right now. If anyone wants to add to my thoughts or even poke holes in my statements I encourage it. Id like to know what everyone else thinks about this company.

{"text": "So, I was pissed yesterday. Then I read between the lines and other boards and I believe they would have outperformed the revenue line if not for the patent sale upcoming. Chen said that yearly income on patents is 250 M$. 250/4= 62.5 M$. Now, look at the deferred revenue line you apes between q4 and q3. It went up 61 million. This is not counted in this quarter's revenue because if they sell the patents this revenue will probably go to the buyer and BB will get what they sell it for. Clearly, people want it to go down but without this patent sale, they would be in line if not outperform the revenue expectation of 246 M$. So what about IVY? The timeframe for the IVY release day is coming sooner than expected! We can expect it in February 2022 which is insane, I was thinking we\u2019d have to wait many more years to see that released. Yes, you read that right, February 2022!!

{"text": "Okay guys, I am going to take the time to write this to all day traders, investors, and those who have been affected by coronavirus. Now is your opportunity to take back what you lost. This company called vaxart (VXRT) is a company based in the Bay Area who focuses on oral recombinant vaccines, such as influenza, norovirus, hpv, and most importantly at this time, coronavirus. The crazy thing is that not many people care to understand science, but if you read the presentation from 3/25/2021, it may help profusely: The company released an 8k on February 3rd, 2021, which highlights the Janssen collaboration agreement. This collab agreement let's Janssen (owned by JnJ) use their influenza antigen and put it in vaxart pill. The final sentence reads, \"Upon delivery of the report, Janssen has a three-month option to negotiate an exclusive worldwide license to the Company\u2019s technology encompassing the Janssen antigens. Janssen has not notified the Company whether it will exercise this option.\" 3 months is 90 days. 90 days from Feb 3 is May 4th ( The pill was put the test against the leading injectable for the flu, sanofis fluzone . Studies showed that even though Sanofis Fluzone had 10x more antibodies, Vaxarts/Janssens flu pill worked 8% better at preventing influenza because of the heavy amount of T-cells and activating mucosal membranes. Oh yeah, this was funded by BARDA also, so the government knows all about them. Back to may 3rd...vaxart last week announced that they are having a Stanford University T-cell expert to discuss cross-protection against variants. The NEXT DAY, may 4th, Vaxarts Chief Scientific Officer, Sean Tucker, Ph.D., will present at the upcoming World Vaccine Congress Washington that will be held virtually from May 4-6, 2021. The World Vaccine Congress is the largest, most established meeting dedicated to vaccines. From basic research to commercial manufacture, this one meeting covers the whole vaccine value chain where science, government and manufacturers all come together to create groundbreaking progress. Here is a link of speakers : These room temperature stable tablets can be shipped overseas to India and Brazil, and all other spots of the world cheaper, easier, without vaccination sites, without fear of needles, (which accounts for 18% of the population of the US alone.), which enables cross variant protection while activating musocal immunity. Another benefit is they are environmentally friendly. No need for disposal of hundreds of million plastic syringes. There is much more Due diligence you could find, such as googling \"richetti brothers vaxart\", \"lodi&the world s2e1\" <<<< Atwill claiming 1 billion pills by years end, and much much more, but that's enough for now. Another important note is that on February 3rd, 2021, vaxart dropped 60% and continued to fall from 25 to 5. This was due to investors knowing about money, not the science. Once they realize they can't compare MRNA technology to their VAAST technology, this thing will BLOW. Example: the influenza studies. Side note: HUGE MISCONCEPTION. MERCK, PFIZER(pill), RIDGEBACK, REMDESIRIVIR, all those are THERAPEUTICS AND ANTIVIRALS. THEY WORK SYSTEMICALLY. THIS IS A VACCINE. A PREVENTION FROM THE VIRUS ENTERING YOUR SYSTEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. Side note 2: their building is connected to Janssen with a skybridge. Literally. AND they've increased their employee headcount by 500% in a year with 34 pending positions on LinkedIn. Once those positions are filled, 825% increase in employees.

{"text": "Disclosure: All of the following represents my own opinion. \u200b Recently, LMC especially towards retail investors like us. For this reason, it is critical to do extensive DD before you ever believe a short-report. Think about all of the shorts that lost billions on Tesla last year. People like Cathie Wood, who actually took a deep dive into Tesla\u2019s value proposition and learned the use-cases for their vehicles & technology, are now swimming in money. It\u2019s important to remember that there are 2 sides to every story, especially when a short-seller has a vested interested in a stock price going down. And yes, Hindenburg was the short-seller that helped bring Nikola down from their sky-high valuation last year and exposed them for fraud. However, LMC is much different than Nikola. So, in this post, I\u2019m going to do 2 things: 1. Break down some of the many inaccuracies in Hindenburg\u2019s \u201cresearch report\u201d against LMC. 2. Show you why RIDE stock currently presents an excellent opportunity for both short-term & long-term growth. Okay, let\u2019s get started. \u200b First and foremost, two key people in Ohio recently stepped up to defend LMC from Hindenburg\u2019s allegations. Per Senator Michael Rulli, \u201c(LMC) is way way way far along,\u201d he said. \u201cWhoever wrote that article has never been in that plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.\u201d U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, who is considering a U.S. Senate run in 2022, didn\u2019t mince words about the short-seller report. He called it \u201cbull-\\\\\\\\.\u201d \u201cI mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for people to make money,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd look, I mean (LMC) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don\u2019t get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.\u201d Tim Ryan is spot on. Hindenburg\u2019s report was a bunch of BS filled with fluff to make LMC appear weak in the public eye. \u200b Now, onto an overview of LMC: GM invested in LMC back in 2019 in exchange for their massive 6.2 million square foot facility driving the truck in the November video I linked above. For those of you who follow Marcus, you understand that he knows a successful business when he sees one. I think it says a lot that he decided to pursue a long-term partnership with LMC. LMC is a start-up, so they hired consultants to travel around the country and show off the Endurance prototype and generate pre-orders to assess demand. This is much more cost-efficient for a young company rather than hiring hundreds of salespeople in-house. Hindenburg points out some of the LOI are from very small companies that aren\u2019t likely to fill all of the pre-orders that they\u2019ve put on paper \u2013 and they specifically call out a small company called E Squared Energy. However, the E Squared CEO came to the defense of LMC of Rivian\u2019s market cap in the next couple of years, RIDE stock would be worth over $160 per share. The growth opportunity and technical upside here is too big to ignore. \u200b TL;DR ( \u2013 literally an American underdog story. It\u2019s a damn shame that Hindenburg wrongfully attacked a company in small-town Ohio that is bringing 1000\u2019s of jobs to our country.

Anyone smoothbrained and smarter than me please feel free to explain in more depth. Ubiquiti has dropped 12% on the day and this news has not hit mainstream networks or media yet, just a system security blog and a small Yahoo Finance alert.

I also have no positions in Facebook and do not intend to initiate any positions in Facebook. Enjoy! TL:DR = Facebook is the most profitable, yet undervalued, tech stock you can buy. Period. MARCH 26, 2021 Brief History, Founders, Locations Facebook was created in February 2004 at Harvard University by Mark Zuckerberg (Founder), Eduardo Saverin (Financier), Dustin Moskovitz (Programmer), and Andrew McCollum (Graphic Designer)(Mezrich, 2009). Using $20,000 USD raised by Mark and Eduardo, Facebook operated for a few months before moving to California to raise more capital (Mezrich, 2009). They soon attracted the attention of Peter Thiel and a few other angel investors. Together, they raised $500,000 in a convertible note with the stipulation that Facebook needed to reach 1.5 million users by the end of 2004 (Kirkpatrick, 2010). The company continued to grow relentlessly after that first year. Annual revenues exceeded $1 billion in 2010 with a business model focused entirely on advertising (Kirkpatrick, 2010). In 2012, Facebook went public through an initial public offering (IPO) in May 2012. By September 2012, Facebook had over one billion active users and acquired the social media website, Instagram for $1 billion (\u201cFacebook to Acquire Instagram\u201d, 2012). In 2014, Facebook acquired WhatsApp, a smartphone instant messaging application (\u201cGetting the Messages\u201d, 2014). During that same year, Facebook also acquired Oculus VR, a virtual reality startup (Zuckerberg, 2014). In recent years, Facebook has become somewhat of a pariah within the public view and this negative sentiment has affected the valuation of the company. The company is often accused of being invasive, breaking antitrust laws, and avoiding taxes through international subsidiaries with favorable business tax codes (\u201cFacebook Paid \u00a32.9M\u201d, 2012). Facebook is headquartered in Menlo Park, California and has over 50 offices located around the world. Facebook also has 16 data centers around the world, which are critical to their operations (\u201cFacebook Office Locations\u201d, n.d.). Facebook also owns several subsidiaries that enable them to operate worldwide. The company continues to maintain a fairly aggressive mergers and acquisitions program to expand its portfolio of products and services. Mark Zuckerberg Facebook is still founder-run by Mark Zuckerberg, who is the incumbent CEO. Mark studied computer science and psychology at Harvard University between 2002 and 2004 (\u201cMark Zuckerberg\u201d, 2021). He dropped out of Harvard University to focus on building Facebook and has been the CEO since the company\u2019s inception. In 2015, he also founded a non-profit organization with his wife, called the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (\u201cMark Zuckerberg\u201d, 2021). The non-profit is unrelated to Facebook\u2019s operations, but it advances the interests of science, education, justice, opportunity, and community. Mark lives in Palo Alto, California (\u201cMark Zuckerberg\u201d, 2021). Industries, Employees, and Products Facebook employs over 58,600 associates around the world and is classified under the Communications Services sector. Within this sector, they are classified under the Interactive Media & Services industry. Some of Facebook\u2019s largest suite of products are included in the chart below: Consumer Products 1. Facebook 2. Instagram 3. WhatsApp 4. Boomerang 5. Messenger 6. Facebook Payments 7. Lifestage 8. Facebook Moves 9. Facebook Marketplace 10. Oculus VR 11. Facebook Gaming Business Products 1.

Facebook Campus 10. Facebook/Instagram Shops 11. Origami Current Financials At the time of this writing, Facebook had the following financial information and ratios (\u201cFacebook Financial Statements\u201d, n.d.): Shares Outstanding: 2,847,670,000 Market Cap: $793.8B Profit Margin (TTM): 33.9% Profit Margin (MRQ): 39.97% Free Cash Flow (2020): $23.63B Debt to Equity (D/E: 9.56% Debt to Capital (D/C): 8.01% Gross revenue for 2020 was $85.96 billion with an operating revenue of $32.67 billion and net revenue of $29.14 billion (\u201cFacebook Financial Statements\u201d, n.d.). Facebook has an extremely healthy balance sheet with $61.95 billion in cash and $31 billion in total liabilities (\u201cFacebook Financial Statements\u201d, n.d.). As of December 31, 2020, Facebook had $77.34 billion in retained earnings and shareholder equity has been growing consistently year-over-year since the company went public in 2012 (\u201cFacebook Financial Statements\u201d, n.d.). The company also maintains high levels of liquidity as its current ratio is consistently higher than 1.0 and as of December 31, 2020, the company had a current ratio of 5.0 (\u201cFacebook Financial Statements\u201d, n.d.). Stock Price, Price Target, and Options Greeks Facebook\u2019s next earnings report will be for Q1 2021 and is expected to be reported on April 27, 2021. The consensus estimate for EPS is about $2.37 and there is no doubt that the company will exceed this EPS target (\u201cFacebook Earnings Whisper\u201d, n.d.). Facebook is currently trading around $280 per share and at a PE ratio of 27.6 (\u201cFacebook Financial Statements\u201d, n.d.). The PEG ratio is 1.28 and this suggests that Facebook is one of the cheapest tech companies an investor could buy today (\u201cFacebook Financial Statements\u201d, n.d.). Historically, Facebook\u2019s PE ratio has averaged around 32.8 and the average tech company has a PE ratio of around 40 (\u201cFacebook Financial Statements\u201d, n.d.). If Facebook sees earnings multiple expansion in the same fashion as the typical tech company, this implies a $333 price target. Given the current environment with zero interest rates policy (ZIRP) and \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d (TINA) fueling equity inflows, it would not be surprising to see the Facebook stock price rally to $400 by the end of 2021, especially if its PE ratio expands towards the 40 mark. Facebook will likely become the next trillion dollar company by market capitalization and it will reach this milestone once the share price hits $353, assuming no other shares are issued (\u201cFacebook Financial Statements\u201d, n.d.). Looking at the derivatives market, the April 30, 2021 options have the largest open interest of 1,763 at the $320 strike for calls and an open interest of 642 at the $265 strike on puts (\u201cOptions Chain: FB\u201d, n.d.). This implies a move of +/- 15% given the current price of approximately $280/share. 30-day Historical Volatility (HV30) is about 35% and the current Implied Volatility (IV) for Facebook is 35% (\u201cOptions Chain: FB\u201d, n.d.). This suggests that the premiums for these contracts are as expensive as they have been in the past. Current shareholders of round lots should consider selling weekly call options to collect extra income. Prospective shareholders should consider selling weekly puts to collect income and acquire the stock at a lower cost basis. SWOT Analysis Facebook's greatest strength is its advertising solutions that it provides to businesses. This is especially helpful to small businesses that often have simple advertising budgets and need to drive as much return on ad spend (ROAS) as they possibly can. Contrary to what a low information public perceives, Facebook does not sell user data and they do not sell personal data (\u201cDoes Facebook Sell My Information?\u201d, n.d.). The company uses data that is voluntarily given by their users to provide advertisers highly targeted, anonymous, audiences for their advertising needs. Their weakness is also related to their core revenue model in that Facebook\u2019s business is driven almost entirely through advertising revenue. Having such a highly concentrated business model leaves the company vulnerable to headwinds. As mentioned on the Q4 2020 earnings call by Wehner, \u201cWe also expect to face more significant ad targeting headwinds in 2021. This includes the impact of platform changes, notably iOS14, as well as the evolving regulatory landscape\u201d (\u201cFacebook Q4 2020 Earnings\u201d, 2021, p. 9). Apple will make it harder for publishers to run digital advertising for users on iOS14 and this will present a problem to many businesses. Facebook\u2019s short-term opportunities include efforts to further monetize their portfolio of other applications and digital properties. If Facebook can continue to commercialize Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus VR, these properties will fuel continued revenue growth. For example, virtual reality is emerging technology and there is massive potential with Oculus VR to provide entertainment through virtual reality games, tourism, education, and more. As a segue into the threats, another opportunity for Facebook is in public relations and educating a low information public about Facebook\u2019s operations and combat misinformation. Facebook\u2019s threats are concentrated around government intervention. Between a low information public and a low information government body, Facebook faces a very real threat from antitrust litigation and repealing section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA). Section 230 protects website owners from civil liabilities due to user generated content and allows platforms to regulate content largely as they see fit (\u201c47 U.S. Code \u00a7230\u201d, n.d.). Both Republican and Democrat administrations have expressed their desire to repeal section 230 which could potentially eviscerate Facebook and other internet companies if that were to happen. Conclusion Facebook should keep doing what they are, as it is clearly working and has been working for about a decade now. To remain competitive, they should focus on expanding their revenue outside of advertising. This can be done through mergers and acquisitions or new product introduction. If they do not wish to diversify their business operations outside of advertising, then they should consider paying a dividend and improve operating margin expansion. If interest rates were to rise over the next year or so, that should not pose a problem to the company since they have high levels of cash, negligible debt, and impressive margins. They should also keep their expenses in lobbyists and lawyers to protect themselves from antitrust litigation or legislation that may result in section 230 being repealed. Finally, they should launch a series of PR campaigns to influence public opinion as the company is routinely subject to controversy, both real and imagined. Love it or hate it, the bottom line is that Facebook is an extremely profitable company that is wildly undervalued by the current market when compared to its peers.

{"text": "Kinder Morgan Alright ladies and gentlemen. I want to let you in on a little secret stock I stumbled upon. The stock is Kinder Morgan. What is Kinder Morgan? Kinder Morgan is an energy infrastructure company. The company operates through Natural Gas Pipelines, Products Pipelines, Terminals, and CO2 segments. The Natural Gas Pipelines segment owns and operates interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline, and underground storage systems; natural gas gathering systems and natural gas processing and treating facilities; natural gas liquids fractionation facilities and transportation systems; and liquefied natural gas liquefaction and storage facilities. Why is this stock a buy? KMI will begin trading ex-dividend on April 29, 2021. A cash dividend payment of $0.27 per share is scheduled to be paid on May 17, 2021. Not only does this stock pay dividends, but it pays more than most stocks. So, it\u2019s very likely we will see a dip on the 29th and be a good entry point for many. Energy infrastructure provider Kinder Morgan posted first-quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share of 60 cents, handsomely beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents. The strong quarterly earnings were aided by higher contribution from Texas intrastate systems and the Tennessee Gas Pipeline during the winter storm in February. Moreover, favorable conditions in the CO2 segment boosted the results. The company announced a hike of 3% in first-quarter 2021 dividend from the fourth-quarter 2020 level, as previously planned. The latest dividend of 27 cents per share translates to $1.08 on an annualized basis. The dividend is expected to be paid on May 17 to Kinder Morgan\u2019s shareholders of record as of Apr 30. Notably, Kinder Morgan significantly raised its 2021 net income expectation to the range of $2.7-$2.9 billion. The company projects DCF for this year within $5.1-$5.3 billion. In 2021, the leading North American energy infrastructure company expects $900 million to be used in sustaining capital expenditures. The company further informed that its Louisiana Pipeline\u2019s Acadiana expansion plan is expected to come online by first-quarter 2022. (Kinder Morgan Q1 Earnings Beat on Texas Winter Storm) Crazy Inexpensive Options Personally, I\u2019m not much of a shareholder. I like to trade with options. So, with this stock it\u2019s options are ridiculously cheap. The prices of some 2023 leaps go for less than 1.00 premiums. Crazy cheap! The June 18 calls are running at about 0.06-0.07 premiums for $20 strikes. What\u2019s my position? Currently, I am holding 150 Jan 21, 2022 calls as well as 75 Jun 18, 2021 calls. All at $20 strikes. Conclusion Personally this stock looks really good for a long term hold, as well as a mid length hold. Leaps look like it could make some decent cash, as well as the June calls. If you have anything you want to add, feel free to put it in the comments. TLDR KMI calls are cheap and stock likes to go up. 6/18 $20 looks tasty.

{"text": "\u201c\u201cThe tendies are coming, the tendies are coming\u201d \u2013 Paul Revere\u201d\u201d \u2013 HomeDepotHank69 Apes, I have excellent news. Today, I woke up (with only a half chub) and thought to myself \u201cI\u2019m gonna be super productive today and get a ton of work done.\u201d Then, my ADHD medicine kicked in and I went down another GME rabbit hole. Here is the product of that (I will warn you, this is long): I have done a lot of digging and have found some extraordinary similarities from last year\u2019s annual meeting of stockholders to this one and why it and the months leading up to it should be HUGE for GME. This is not a technical analysis, this is pure DD. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. Just a note: you can find all of these documents simply by searching \u201cGamestop Notice of 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders\u201d on Google, I just picked out the important parts to make it easier. History I am first going to start with GME\u2019s share price as of April 2020: \u200b As you can see, on April 3rd, 2020, GME\u2019s price bottomed to under $2. This was due to Covid absolutely crushing the company and shorters seeking to hit the \u201cbankruptcy jackpot.\u201d However, on April 3rd and the next few days, we see the price of GME almost triple all the way up to $6. Why was this? Some of you may remember Michael Burry announced his GME position in April 2020. Well, that\u2019s not what caused this rise as Burry announced his stake on Friday the 10th, which caused a rise on Monday the 13th: \u200b So if it wasn\u2019t Michael Burry\u2019s announcement of his position, then what was it? Was it the announcement of the annual shareholder\u2019s meeting? Nope, that was announced in late April as well: \u200b So, if it wasn\u2019t either of those things, then what was it? The drastic rise in GME starting April 3rd, 2020 (which seems pathetic compared to today\u2019s price action) was due to a group of activist investors, Hestia Capital, who owned 7.5% of GME at the time announcing that they would be nominating new members of the board at the shareholders meeting. When was this letter released? April 3rd, 2020: \u200b Why is this significant? Well, for some reason it was pretty well known that GME\u2019s short interest was over 100% at this time (still blows my mind that more people didn\u2019t pounce on this at the time, myself included). Again, this was because Covid was destroying GME and shorts were looking to get the \u201cbankruptcy jackpot.\u201d I believe that this is when shorts were deploying massive amounts of naked shorts. Their reasoning was that if they pushed GME into bankruptcy, they wouldn\u2019t have to repay the naked shorts because the company wouldn\u2019t exist anymore (this is just a theory but it seems reasonable considering what\u2019s happened today). Shorts took a calculated risk that they thought would pay off. Their reasoning was that at the best they hit the bankruptcy jackpot and at the worst they stock goes up a little and they take a slight loss due to the naked shorts (boy were they wrong on that one). Well, their plan almost worked. They got it down to under $3. Then, this statement came out. Why is that statement significant? Well, this letter explicitly stated that GME has high short interest and that in order to vote, shareholders need to recall their shares from anyone who has them on loan before the date of April 20, 2020: \u200b Look back at the GME chart that I posted at the top of this. BOOM. This company announces that and people start recalling their shares, forcing some shorts to cover. GME\u2019s massive short interest at this time was already well known: \u200b From that point on, GME's price never even got close to that $3 range again: \u200b I couldn\u2019t include the rest of the chart because it makes these moves seem insignificant because of GME\u2019s massive price today. This is where the shorts should\u2019ve thrown in the towel and taken the loss, but they didn\u2019t. They kept shorting GME and, as we all know, the short interest eventually hit 140% and the January events happened. And know we\u2019re here, exactly 1 year later to the tee. The rest of this post will be going over the similarities of this period last year to today and my thoughts on what might happen. Similarities So, as stated above, GME\u2019s price rose so rapidly on April 3rd because of that proxy statement urging shareholders to recall their shares. This, which was simply an urging, not a full recall, lead to an almost 3x increase in price in just a few days. Imagine if GME does a forced recall of the shares this time around: BOOM. The first similarity is the presence of activist investors trying to make a fundamental change to GME as a company. The 2020 activist investor that I mentioned above, Hestia Capital, was what Ryan Cohen currently is. From the proxy statement, we can see that Hestia was actively trying to replace people on the GME board of directors for their inaction and ineffectiveness: \u200b Also, note that the whole point of this proxy letter was Hestia announcing that they are nominating people to the board for the 2020 meeting and that shareholders need to vote. Does this feel any similar to Cohen getting on the board, ousting the C.F.O., and bringing on Chewey and Amazon execs? Throughout the letter, Hestia documents the reasons for their desire to change the board and documents a history of the events leading up to it. This is far too much information to screenshot, but I encourage you to read it for yourself: [ (Search \u201creasons for the solicitation\u201d and \u201cbackground of the solicitation\u201d within the document to find these points). To recap, we have the presence of an activist investor trying to shake up the board of GME, GME having a massive short interest, naked/abusive shorting activity, the annual shareholders meeting being in June (last year it was June 12th, this year it is June 11th), and an activist investor trying to change the fundamental direction of the company. All of this went down in April and was related to the shareholders meeting in June. Sounds pretty similar to today right? But what\u2019s the difference? Ryan Cohen is a much stronger activist investor, seems to have more power in the company, has a clearer vision than Hestia, and is making changes more aggressively. Another difference is obviously GME\u2019s price, media coverage, and volume. The short squeeze has made GME a hot media topic, the price is multiples higher than it was a year ago (almost 200x), and the volume (though lower recently) is still MUCH higher than it was one year ago (see any GME chart and compare the volume). But there\u2019s one more difference that is crucial. There is an odd phenomenon in GME today. A strange primate whose scientific name is hominoidea, whose hands are strong as diamonds, and whose wives have endless boyfriends. Yes, I am talking about apes. The uncanny ability of apes to buy and hold throughout any storm has created a sort of wall of support on GME that makes it very hard for shorts to kill the price. Combine that with another strange creature, whose scientific name is Cetacea, who has deep pockets and a symbiotic relationship with hominoidea. This is our whale. This symbiotic relationship means that the shorts are toast (I\u2019m not even joking here, apes have created a wall of support, we have power). Combine all of this with the abusive shorting, failure to deliver cycle, statutory leverage ratio relief not being extended, and new DTCC/SEC regulations on abusive shorting and you have a recipe for tendies. The future So, I broke down the past, showed you the similarities, and talked about the present. Now what? Well, here are my thoughts on how the potential GME shareholder\u2019s meeting and the months leading up to it could affect the stock: First, I want to echo what everyone else says about dates and predictions - they are not set in stone, do not base your strategy off of them, and do not treat them as fact as it could lead to more doubt among newer apes. This is not a prediction, this is simply a date/time to keep in mind. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I am Hank. Uncle Hank. I would like to turn your attention to the week of April 12th and the week of April 19th. This is a 2 week period. As many of you apes know, our golden ticket would be a share recall. A share recall would force shorts to return the borrowed shares of GME to the rightful owners. Obviously, this would literally force the shorts to cover and would lead to massive tendies. As I've said in my previous posts, GME needs volume in order to rise and catalysts are what create volume. As we have seen, GME is particularly sensitive to catalysts, especially those relating to its leadership and Ryan Cohen. This was most evident when GME shot back up from the dead in late February after they announced the ousting of their C.F.O. The SEC does not allow a company to recall its shares earlier than 60 days of the shareholder's annual general meeting. Many people hoped a share recall would be announced during earnings (Mar 23), but this would have been a violation of SEC rules, so that was off the table from the start. For context, here are the dates of the past four meetings: June 10, June 26, Jun 10, June 2. This year\u2019s meeting is June 12th or 11th (not sure which but it\u2019s one of those). Let's use June 11 as our assumption. 60 days prior to June 10th would put us at April 12. Moreover, the tenure of the current C.E.O. also lines up with that date. The current C.E.O. is on a vesting schedule (incentive to stay with a company until a certain date to receive some form of compensation). Per his vesting schedule, he will get 84k shares of GME on April 15th. GME could possibly be waiting until that date to announce Cohen as the C.E.O. (or at the very least to announce that the current C.E.O. is parting ways with the company). Remember when this happened to the C.F.O in February (the price returned from the dead), just imagine how much bigger the rise would be if this announcement was for the C.E.O. Now, turn your attention back to everything I said above about last year. Maybe GME will announce that they are planning on holding some kind of vote for board positions, or maybe someone with a significant stake in GME (oh Idk maybe Cohen whose stake is almost double what Hestia\u2019s was) could submit a proxy statement similar to Hestia\u2019s which encourages shareholders to recall their shares so they can vote. Or, maybe GME will announce a forced recall for the purposes of voting (GME already acknowledged in their SEC filing that they are aware that their stock still has very high short interest). Maybe this explains why the conference call was so bland: the C.E.O. knows that he\u2019s on the outs and was instructed by the board to give a bare-bones call so they can announce the juicy stuff later when he\u2019s out. OR, maybe there will be more announcements about more board members coming on similar to the recent announcement of the Chewey and Amazon execs. Either way, if any of these announcements require a vote and shares are forcibly recalled or if it is recommended that shareholders recall their shares, then maybe we will see something similar to last year. That date (April 15th) is also significant because the monthly options for April are expiring on April 16. Because of that, expect, at the very least, higher volume on that Friday and the Thursday preceding it. This might also explain why the earnings call felt so bare-bones. AT THE VERY LEAST, we will get some kind of good announcement during the shareholders meeting in June, but I would expect something sooner. At this point, I don't see a world where Cohen is not named a C-suite executive of GME. He owns 13% (obviously has a huge personal interest in its success), has recruited Chewey executives (and maybe the person from Amazon as well), and appears to be shaking up the board and other C-suite positions. I would be shocked if he just kinda sat outside the action as the puppet master. He has too much vested in this to not obtain direct power over the situation. It also appears that the company is going in the direction that he wants to take it (e-commerce shift), so it wouldn't make sense for him not to be a C-suite executive at some point. It's also significant that GME has made leadership announcements in each of the past few months (C.F.O. in February, Amazon + Chewey Execs in March), and that it would make sense for another announcement to come in April especially considering last year's activity in April regarding leadership and where Cohen is currently trying to take the company. As many of you know DFV's calls expire on that day. At this point, it should be obvious that he is exercising those because if he was gonna just take the profits and rollover the contract, he would've done so much earlier because theta has been eating those. This is again just conjecture, but maybe DFV is waiting until that date to exercise his calls in order to inflict more pain on market makers for failing to deliver shares. This is again just conjecture did research similar to this and came to the conclusion that April 16th would be a crucial day, so he is waiting til then to exercise to put more pressure on the failure to delivers. If you've kept up with his updates, he has plenty of cash on hand so he could easily exercise these. What he could also do is buy more calls (at a later date), which would put obvious upward pressure on the stock. One thing is for certain, he's not going to let those options expire worthless, especially considering the fact that he has millions in cash in his account. Finally, I also wanted to discuss why I believe that the leadership of GME (at least the new ones) and Cohen are on our side, which is why a share recall would benefit them. First, as we all know, Cohen loves to tweet cryptic stuff (it's actually pretty obvious that it's about GME). A few weeks ago he tweeted that video of the puppet that people deciphered to be about a commercial that said \"I love your shorts.\" Recently he tweeted a vid of TED hitting a bong that people deciphered to mean either bears got smoked or bears took a big hit (this is when it shot up significantly in a day). So, as we all know Cohen is insanely interested in GME and its stock price - and why wouldn't he be, he has 13% ownership (there are also reports of him calling up disgruntled customers asking how he can make their service better). Now, this is why a share recall would benefit GME. There are two different sets of assumptions that we have to work with here: assumption 1 is that the leadership of GME (Cohen included) does not subscribe to the theory that GME is abusively shorted. If we go with this assumption and say that GME is only shorted 25% (boomer data), a share recall benefits them because it will alleviate some of the selling pressure that shorting creates, which will allow the stock to go up. Assumption 2 (the more likely assumption) is that the leadership subscribes to the theory that GME is being abusively shorted. The reason why I believe this is more likely is because of their SEC filing where they addressed that GME has high short interest and that continuing this could cause a short squeeze. This was like when Porsche announced that they had a huge stake in VW to \"warn\" the shorts to cover. If this theory is true, GME is aware that their company is being abusively shorted and is not reflective of the real price of the stock. Therefore, it would be significantly in their interest to recall shares, which would force naked shorts to cover and would DRASTICALLY decrease the downward pressure. Whichever theory they subscribe to, it benefits them immensely to do a recall, and I believe that assumption 2 is far more likely. Yeah I know that was long, rabbit holes will do that to ya. TL;DR One year ago to the tee, GME\u2019s stock rose on the announcement that an activist investor was having a vote and they recommended shareholders to recall their shares. The short interest was over 100%. The activist investor sought to shakeup management and change the direction of GME. Fast forward to today (exactly 1 year later), and we have an activist investor changing up the company. If GME does a share recall ahead of this meeting or if Cohen releases a proxy statement encouraging shareholders to recall their shares, we could very well see a meteoric rise similar to last year at this time. GME has not provided much information on that meeting, so, similar to last year, updates could come in the month of April. We know that any announcement about leadership changes makes the stock rise.

{"text": "Alright so you've obviously heard the craze by now about psych stocks and I'm sure a lot of it has been gain porn and fat stacks. If MNMD's poor up-listing performance today didn't turn you off, here is some DD that will hopefully give you a better idea of what the company does. Plenty of people seem to think that MNMD is going to be selling tabs of acid and caps of mush to folks, but that's just not it. Take a look at whats below if you're interested. \u200b Psych Sector Quick Overview At the moment, there are (I think) 28 publicly traded companies in the sector. They are pretty much all penny stocks, except for Compass and Mind Med. This is a nascent sector and most likely an extended play given the time it takes for the drugs to come to market. Basically the sector can be divided into three main groups: 1) Drug Developers, 2) Clinic companies, and 3) Recreational Companies. Many companies blend these different categories but the one we are looking at today is predominantly in the drug development space. The drugs they are working on can be classified into two distinct categories: 1) Classical psychedelic compounds (Psilocybin, LSD, DMT, etc.) and 2) Novel psychedelic compounds (Derivatives and Novel Formulations). MindMed is focused on developing a blend of these two. There's an incredible wealth of research that has gone into these substances and how they are presumed to be far more effective than traditional therapy options in treating a variety of psychological disorders and ailments. In fact, Ketamine is already being used in assisted therapy in many places around the world. The sector had quite the run last fall and early into the new year. Looking like there might be another run based on a couple of big-name catalysts in the coming weeks. Because of the volatility and anecdotal hype, plenty of people have likened the sector to weed. But anyone who has felt the benefits of these drugs knows it's not the same. Sure, most of the companies are going to fail, and many don't have a lot to offer at all. However, MindMed is one of the biggest names, with the biggest backers and the most expansive drug pipelines, so it's nice to think they are in a league of their own. \u200b Mind Medicine: To get us started, their mission statement: \u201cMindMed\u2019s mission is to discovery, development, and deploy psychedelic inspired medicines and therapies intended to treat diseases in the areas of psychiatry, neurology, addiction, pain, and potentially others such as anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and withdrawal, and adult attention deficit disorder.\u201d The company breaks its process down into three parts that I\u2019ll preface here so that you can reference them as you read through: Discover: This is where new compounds are being discovered, formulated, and tested in pre-clinical settings. Making sure things are safe and effective. Develop: Where the clinical trials start-up and the big money is spent. Deploy: Commercialization, distribution, scaling, access; the business side of things. Will touch more on these different stages and what they have going on further down. \u200b MindMed: Financials and Company Drug development is crazy expensive, and MindMed has taken the opportunity many times to raise capital to finance its growth and development over the last year. Investors have complained quite a lot about it over the previous year, but it\u2019s a reality we\u2019re just going to have to deal with. Also, on this note, keep an eye out for up to CAD $500 million to be raised over the next two years; the base shelf prospectus has been filed and will be effective in the near future. \\Sorry, I really don\u2019t feel like doing all to currency conversions between USD and CAD.\\ Funding \u2013 Total Funding: As of March 30, 2021, MindMed had a cash balance of $203 Million (All in CAD) Tranche 2: February 18, 2020 MindMed completes second tranche for $9,227,000 CAD Tranche 3: February 26, 2020 MindMed completes third tranche for $10,252,000 CAD Offering 1: May 26, 2020 MindMed completes bought deal financing for $9,582,000 CAD Offering 2: October 30, 2020 MindMed completes bought deal for $28,751,000 CAD Offering 3: December 11, 2020 MindMed completes bought deal for $34,523,000 CAD Offering 4: January 7, 2021 MindMed completes bought deal for $92,100,000 CAD Offering 5: March 8, 2021 MindMed complete private financing deal for $19,500,000 CAD Base Shelf Prospectus: On April 9th, 2021, MindMed filed their final short form prospectus, pretty much laying out a way for them to more easily raise up to $500 million (CANADIAN) whenever market conditions are optimal for the next 25 months. So be on the lookout for some pretty decent money-raising when/if the share price is looking crispy MindMed has never shied away from milking the pockets of eager investors; nor should they. The consistent interest from investors is a great sign; it's not as if people are scared of throwing their money into this company. MindMed burned through $24.2 million CAD in 2020. Total comprehensive loss for the year of 2020 was $35.1 million but was offset by like $8 million. Expenses \u2013 One of MindMed\u2019s recent filings laid out how they intend to allocate their funding over the next year or two reasonably well. If you\u2019re looking for this kind of information, you can find the MD&A filing on SEDAR. They also lay out how they anticipate allocating funding from specific offerings to specific programs. It\u2019s a lot of information, but I\u2019m not going to include it here. Quite a few of MindMed\u2019s acquisitions have been predominantly made via the offering of shares, so they haven\u2019t had the same level of cash burning as some of the other emerging companies in the sector. For example: 55 Million Class A shares were offered for their 18-MC program 81,833 Multiple Voting Shares (8,183,300 equivalent) were issued to acquire Health Mode (plus a cash payment of $286,000) Fair Value of Common Shares: Haven\u2019t been able to find any estimates or projections. If you know of any, just send a message, and this will be updated. The recent offering prices and warrant exercise prices might give you an idea of what investors have been willing to pay for the issued shares. Will put those below. Also, the up-listing today saw some tremendous volatility and the stock reaching all time highs. (RIP to the fella who bought for over $8 USD premarket lol) \u200b |Offering Close Date|Unit Price|Warrant Symbol|Exercise Price / Date| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |May 26, 2020|$0.53 CAD|(MindMed).WT|$0.79 CAD \u2013 May 26, 2022| |October 30, 2020|$1.05 CAD|(MindMed).WS|$1.40 CAD \u2013 October 30, 2023| |December 11, 2020|$1.90 CAD|(MindMed).WA|$2.45 CAD \u2013 December 11, 2023| |January 7, 2021|$4.40 CAD|(MindMed).WR|$5.75 CAD \u2013 January 7, 2024| |March 8, 2021 (Private)|$3.25 CAD|N/A|$4.40 CAD \u2013 March 9, 2024| \u200b Company and Investments \u2013 To build the company MNMD has focused on acquiring compounds, partnering with labs, and acquisitions. The partnerships they have with labs for R&D are reputable academic institutions that MindMed has agreed to help fund. In turn, MindMed has exclusive access to trials, data, and discoveries. The chart below is taken from their filings hopefully, it gives you a sufficient idea of what the companies structure is looking like. MindMed: Pipeline MindMed has a pretty comprehensive pipeline of drugs they are developing. This pipeline has started to expand more due to their partnerships and acquisitions. Through their partnerships with labs, universities, and researchers, MindMed has exclusive licenses, including DMT, MDMA, LSD, Psilocybin. There are currently four trials going on at University Hospital Basel, and 13 have already been completed giving MindMed some very valuable data to help push their approvals and research along with faster than they otherwise could have. Here\u2019s an overview of their programs, compounds, and trials, along with their stage of development. Discover: April 2020, MindMed signed a nice exclusive collaboration deal with University Hospital Basel\u2019s Liechti Lab (some of the most prolific psychedelic researchers). All IP, trial data, and tech that\u2019s developed here are MindMed\u2019s for the foreseeable future. This originally only gave them access to LSD trials and data, but they\u2019ve since upped their game and expanded the deal to include trials and data on MDMA, DMT, MDMA-LSD (candy flipping), and Psilocybin. Any solid discoveries or advancements will be integrated into MindMed\u2019s pipeline. For example, MindMed already gained data from an ongoing P2 LSD-Anxiety trial from UHB. February 11, 2021, MindMed announced a partnership with MindShift out of Switzerland. This partnership is focused more on developing novel psychedelic compounds to add to their pipeline. This has been a huge trend in the sector. Companies are trying to modify the compounds to be more conducive to the therapeutic process. Lots of talks have been had around taking the \u201ctrip\u201d out of the trip. They are basically allowing people to feel the benefits without hallucinating. Their CEO said some compounds have already been identified for development, but there\u2019s not much on what exactly these secret compounds are. However, patents have apparently been filed over these compounds, so if any of you sleuths can find them, it would be much appreciated. Develop: Once psychedelic compounds are identified, they\u2019ll move onto this stage. As of now MindMed has a couple big ones in the works which you\u2019ll be able to find more details on in the chart below. The trials of focus right now investigating 18-MC and LSD for different purposes. \u200b |Company / Partner|Compound|Disorder / Purpose|Progress / Stage|Rights / IP / Data|Market Competition| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |MindMed (Project Layla)|18-MC (ibogaine derivative)|Opioid Use Disorder, Withdrawal, and Potentially Other Addictions|P2a (Q3 2021) P3 (at the earliest 2023)|Provisional patent filings (MindMed Assignee)|Company focused on developing other Ibogaine derivatives.| |MindMed (Project Lucy)|LSD|Anxiety|P2b (Second half of 2021)|UHB Data|Many companies in the sector are focused on treating anxiety| |MindMed (UHB)|Ketanserin|Psychedelic Antagonist (The Naloxone of Psychs)|P1 (ongoing)|MindMed + UHB have filed a patent application preserving worldwide rights|Benzos have been used to kill trips.| |MindMed (UHB)|LSD|LSD Cluster Headaches|P2 (ongoing)|UHB Data and Rights|Some other headache type trials going on, but not as far along| |MindMed (Project Flow)|LSD|Adult ADD|P2a (approval granted Q3 2021)|UHB Data and Rights|No ongoing trials in other companies investigating this| |MindMed|LSD|Microdosing (focus, creativity, mood, anxiety)|(Starting soon)|Honestly don't know|First ever P2a clinical trial for microdosing LSD. Very little competition this far along| |MindMed (UHB)|DMT|Neurodynamics|P1 (Q2 2021)|UHB Data and Rights|A smallcap is investigating intravenous DMT therapy for stroke patients| |MindMed (UHB)|LSD + MDMA|Candy flipping Investigation|P1 (Q1 2021)|UHB Data and Rights|No candy flipping trials have been conducted yet| |MindMed (MindShift)|Novel Compounds|Investigative|Launching early (Q1 2022)|Patents filed preserving rights to the novel compounds|Many companies are focused on developing their own compounds so there\u2019s a ton of emerging competition here| I wasn't able to actually list the companies they are competing with here since the bot woulda flagged me but if you're curious shoot me a dm and I'll send you the full list. MindMed has some additional compounds that they plan to develop that there hasn\u2019t been a ton of information posted on. However, they are the assignee of a family of patents in the US, Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, and New Zealand for psychotherapy using 3-MMC. The disorders it covers are distress, PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder. A lot of other MindMed IP is being held as trade secrets for the time being, so there\u2019s not a lot to say about it at the moment other than they are expanding their pipeline significantly. \u200b MindMed: Partnerships and Technology Alright, so now that we have all the major trials and compounds pretty much covered, the third part of the MindMed process is the deploy phase. This is where their technology projects and other partnerships come into play. The chart below should give you a decent overview of the three biggest developments to come out of MindMed in this front. \u200b |Partner/Project|Purpose| |:-|:-| |Project Albert|JR (CEO) has been stressing the importance of Project Albert for some time now. He has repeatedly emphasized that MindMed is a drug development and technology company. Project Albert is based on designing and integrating digital therapeutic tools into the psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy process. They\u2019re looking to integrate wearables, tracking, platforms, and other tools into the therapy process so that it can be more patient-personalized, effective, and informative. They\u2019re also hoping that this part of the company improves the access people have to these medications through telemedicine.| |MindMed + HealthMode|MindMed added HealthMode to the company to expand Project Albert. Using AI, MindMed aims to help speed up the clinical research process and improve patient monitoring efforts. MindMed took on HealthMode\u2019s entire team and portfolio and will begin to integrate what they have into the trails being developed as well as future patient monitoring platforms.| |NYU Langone|MindMed is now funding a program at NYU Langone Health to train and prepare the future psychedelic researchers and psychiatrists for the future when these drugs come to market. This isn\u2019t so much a revenue-generating project as it will benefit the sector at large by having professionals prepared to deliver these therapies.| |MindShift Compounds AG|I know I touched on this briefly earlier, but the MindShift partnership is where MindMed will gain access to second-generation psychedelic compounds. We all know about the classical psychedelic compounds (LSD, Psilocybin, MDMA, DMT, etc.); second-gen compounds are being tailored specifically for different therapeutic purposes allowing companies to engineer more effective and, in some cases, safer compounds. Tons of companies are going down this path, so it\u2019s good to have this partnership to add to the portfolio.| \u200b Hopefully that helps some of you out and get you familiar with MNMD. Below this is information on the compounds and trials that MNMD is pursuing. If you aren't interested in a bit of science feel free to cut it off here. If you are, keep reading. \u200b Information on Compounds and Trials : Sections in Order: 1. LSD Neutralizer 2. Cluster Headaches 3. LSD for Adult ADHD/ADD 4. LSD for Anxiety 5. 18-MC for Addiction \u200b LSD Neutralizer As I\u2019m sure a lot of you know, LSD trips last a while. When we are looking at LSD as a compound to be used in assisted therapies, that trip duration brings up some major question marks. 1. Assisted therapies require trained professionals to guide the sessions. Therapy sessions aren\u2019t cheap; the cost of therapy alone is a major barrier for many people seeking out mental health support. Couple the cost of the compounds and the specialization required for extended psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy sessions and you have a recipe for some potentially pricey treatments. 2. LSD is not toxic to the human body. You don\u2019t see the same type of physiological or neurotoxic potential that traditional drugs have. However, that does not mean we\u2019re home free here. It\u2019s important to recognize that LSD does have some potential health harms that we should all be aware of. Improper use can lead to potential physical harm. Bad trips can lead to emotional distress. If you don\u2019t screen for underlying psychological conditions like psychosis and schizophrenia some people can experience serious cognitive harms. This neutralizer technology is purported to act as an off switch for LSD trips. Quick pill and a little while later the trip is over. This funky little compound is called Ketanserin and it\u2019s a major part of dealing with the two issues I mentioned above. If you\u2019re able to control and attenuate the trip, you\u2019re able to reduce the time needed to conduct the therapy session. This can reduce costs related to therapy making it more affordable for a greater number of people. In theory, it could also allow people to take higher single doses, should the therapy demand it, and have the effects neutralized when needed. Now onto the harms\u2026 Luckily for all of us, the harms mentioned above can be managed/mitigated. Proper psychological screening can work out issues related to underlying conditions. Managing set and setting helps reduce the potential for harms related to improper use like stupid behavior and bad trips. This LSD neutralizer is just another great tool in the therapist's tool belt that can be used to mitigate harm during therapy. Being able to stop the experience allows for a failsafe on the therapy sessions which ensures that no one comes out of it worse than they went in. As an add-value, this compound could be sold to recreational users (in theory) to ensure safe at-home use and could also be used in ER departments where occasionally, I'm sure some people come in experiencing bad trips. Cool beans, so how does it work? Well, let me use a quick analogy to get the ball rolling. We are all aware of opioids and how people can easily overdose on them. Guaranteed many of you have also heard of Naloxone, the antidote for an opioid overdose. Think of Kertanserin as you would think of Naloxone. Naloxone and Kertanserin are both antagonists that act against the effects of their respective counterparts. Opioids produce their effects by interacting with the four opioid receptors we all have in our brains. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that works by binding to those receptors and knocking the opioids off of the receptors for a duration of time; allowing for people to seek the additional help that they need. Source here This brings us to Kertanserin and LSD. The psychedelic effects of LSD have been theorized to produce their effects through partial serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism. (Agonism being the opposite of Antagonism) Kertanserin works as an antagonist to the same receptor, allowing for the effects of LSD to be attenuated. Here is a study]( and there isn\u2019t a lot of information out there on what causes them. Regardless, they are painful and people shouldn\u2019t have to deal with it if they don\u2019t have to. Traditional treatments for cluster headaches include oxygen and sumatriptan for single attacks; and verapamil, lithium, corticosteroids, and more for cluster attack periods., found that three single doses of BOL can either break a series of cluster headache attacks or reduce their frequency and intensity. Furthermore, for some, BOL allowed them to achieve remission from their previous chronic cluster headaches. No adverse outcomes were observed in the study. The interesting thing about this study is that the researchers hypothesize that the mechanism of action is unrelated to the serotonin receptor agonism that scientists are theorizing is responsible for hallucinations. This means that it isn\u2019t so much about the hallucinations, but something else that these beautiful compounds have in store. They theorize that the positive effects are the result of serotonin-receptor-mediated vasoconstriction. A very recent 2020. (Maybe from inaccurate dosages?) One other very common concern was the legality of the practice. (Gotta hate those stupid laws) Multiple studies reported that people consistently felt great improvements in creativity. Study 2. Study 4 Some challenges include impaired focus and physiological discomfort. These may be once again due to improper/high dosages. Lack of precision in terms of the compound you are purchasing can also contribute to negative effects. If you are wondering about the theorized mechanisms of actions and stuff I would recommend you check out this study Ultimately there isn\u2019t much clinical evidence to back this one up. I\u2019m glad MMED is taking the steps needed to address this gap in the literature. It will for sure be one that I am paying attention to. Consistent themes in the studies included some negative effects related to dosage. I think that a clinically dosed regime would resolve a lot of these issues especially if a determined dosage scale based on body weight, metabolism, and other factors was developed. However, one major concern I have is that there is anecdotal evidence of microdosing exacerabting underlying mental health issues. \u200b LSD \u2013 For Anxiety A lot of the current focus in terms of LSD and anxiety has been its use in palliative care. People who are faced with some pretty scary diseases have reported some great improvements in their condition after psychedelic experiences. Anxiety is a very very broad category of diagnosis. I won\u2019t be able to cover them all here but I will list the 12 broad diagnosis possibilities the DSM-V gives us. The ones I focused my research on are bold. Separation Anxiety Disorder Selective Mutism Specific Phobia Social Anxiety Disorder Panic Attack Agoraphobia Generalized Anxiety Disorder Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition Other Specified Anxiety Disorder Unspecified Anxiety Disorder Study 1** Mechanism of Action: (For the Science People) LSD potently binds to serotonin 5-HT receptors (1a, 2a, 2c), dopamine d2 receptor, and a2 adrenergic receptor. The hallucinogenic effects are mediated by the drugs affinity for 5-HT2A receptors. This has been proven due to the ability to block these subjective effects using an antagonist (See the LSD Neutralizer). The full scope of the mechanisms of actions has not been fully identified. However, one key mechanism is the activation of frontal cortex glutamate transmission. LSD binds more potently to 5-HT2A receptors than does psilocybin. Unlike other serotonergic hallucinogens, LSD binds to adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors. In humans, LSD may enhance dopamine neurotransmission. (COOL) LSD increases functional connectivity between various brain regions. (COOL) Functional brain imaging showed more globally synchronized activity within the brain and a reduction of network separation while under the pharmacological effects of LSD. LSD decreased default mode network integrity. LSD reduced left amygdala reactivity to the presentation of fearful faces. (COOL) Adverse Effects: Moderate increases in blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and pupil side. Adverse effects 10-24 hours after administration include difficult concentration, headaches, dizziness, lack of appetite, dry mouth, nausea, imbalance, and exhaustion. No severe side effects have been found and it is physically non-toxic. Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD) is a rare disorder stemming from psychedelic use. Occurs almost exclusively in illicit use or patients with underlying cognitive predispositions like anxiety. (Uh oh) Effects on Patients: Profound anxiety or panic was not experienced by patients of one study. LSD mainly induced blissful states, audiovisual synesthesia, changes in the meaning of perceptions, and positively experiences derealization and depersonalization. At 200 micrograms, LSD acutely induced mystical experiences in patients undergoing psychotherapy. This is important because previous studies with psilocybin have shown that mystical experiences are correlated with improvements in mood and personality and better therapeutic outcomes in patients with anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders. Music has been used to produce greater feelings of transcendence and wonder in patients. LSD impaired the recognition of sad and fearful faces and enhanced emotional empathy. LSD produced moderate ego dissolution. LSD produced lower fear perception which may be useful in psychotherapy. Mid/Long Term Effects: The use of classical psychedelics is associated with lower psychological distress, lower suicidality, and lower mental health problems. LSD in healthy subjects increase optimism and trait openness 2 weeks after administration and produced trends towards decreases in distress and delusional thinking. There isn\u2019t a ton of research on LSD for treating anxiety out there right now. You\u2019re far more likely to find literature on psilocybin. This could be for a variety of reasons but regardless it is fantastic that MMED is again, researching to fill the gaps here. My biggest takeaways here are that LSD is showing some significant promise concerning treating anxiety. The effects that it has on the human brain make it a fantastic candidate for integration into therapy sessions. However, something that is often overlooked is the importance of the role of the therapist. I\u2019ll have to look harder into what MMED is doing to develop therapeutic processes but like Study 3 and colleagues to try and produce a safer synthetic iboga derivative. 18-MC is born Since 18-MC and Ibogaine are so closely related I\u2019m going to pull from some more recent studies on both of them to give insight into the efficacy of these drugs on addiction. This study sustained over 12-months. In one of Glick\u2019s ( on 18-MC in rats, he and his colleagues found that it shared all the purported anti-addictive effects of Ibogaine. The advantage of 18-MC is that it is theorized to not have the same hallucinogenic activity as Ibogaine since it does not bind to serotonin receptors. Furthermore, it is less toxic than Ibogaine both physiologically and neurologically*. It is theorized that 18-MC will be able to assist in dealing with more than opioids, however. Alcohol, amphetamines, and cocaine have all been mentioned as possible substances of abuse that can be addressed. One important thing to take out of all of this is that one of the studies found that abstinence from drug abuse lowered over time. This means that there is a potential for repeat treatments over time. Despite this, the frequency in which this would have to occur appears to be significantly less than current alternatives like methadone treatment. \u200b TL;DR - Mind Medicine is developing drugs to treat all your mental health needs. They have the biggest and best pipeline out of any publicly traded psychedelic stock, they are the farthest along overall in terms of aggregate trial progress, and they have emerging compounds that are going to be put into trials starting soon. The CEO loves the idea of integrating tech into the space so theres more than just drugs to get excited about. Revenue is far out but money making opportunities are not.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-04-28 07:29:49", "id": "mzxtz5"}

I would like to see this rule passed and implemented immediately. Lastly on this ruling, I would like to see stronger penalties enacted for non compliance and violation of this rule.

{"text": "Hey, so if anyone remembers, PLTR Demo Day in January 26th turned out to be a huge success. They showed some new features and focused on how they normally show off new feature releases for their customers. They also gave us a little something with what I like to call the \"X-Com Global Defense Demo\". It literally fking rocked. The stock was hovering at $34.32-$36.87 through the day and closed at $35.37 kinda non-spectacularly. However, what happened the next day was a huge surprise to everyone since the stock surged to the ATH $45 before closed at $39. This new demo coming on April 14th (next Wednesday) is the first in a \\series\\ of demos. Sounds like some more in depth about how it works. Hopefully it's not just a bunch of doods with crappy microphones reading off a boring ass script in their kitchen again. [ Do you think we'll see another pop? I'm semi doubtful since it seems a lot of sentiment has shifted over to GME, but it looks like the volume is super low. $PLTR hasn't seen major trading volume for nearly a month. I bought a bunch of shares at $9 back in early October and bought some more when it was in the teens.

{"text": "Overview MAXR or Maxar technologies is a space technology solutions firm. They specialize in satellite imagery, and provide services to NASA and the department of defense including robotics, earth imagery, and geospatial analytics and insight. This company has a long history working with NASA, in 1965 it was known as 'philco-ford', and designed and developed the Houston space center for the gemini and apollo missions. Since helping humans reach the moon for the first time, the firm has gone through a number of acquisitions, and acquired multiple other companies itself. Today MAXR has 4 satellites orbiting earth, which they use for their primary business which is imagery. 60% of their business is satellite imagery services, and 40% is space infrastructure. What do they do with their satellites? MAXR uses satellite imagery to assist the various branches of the military. The company uses satellite imagery to locate mission critical locations of enemy warships, airbases, communications systems, and other physical infrastructure that the military might need to form a tactical plan. MAXR is a key partner in us army's project TITAN, USDI's MAVEN, and NAVY's project Overmatch. The most exciting (imo) technology MAXR offers involves using geospatial data to identify the locations of individual shooters on the battlefield. Pretty crazy, but the company can use satellites to capture images of the battlefield, and provide imagery to soldiers on the ground that pinpoint locations of enemy footsoldiers. The companies AI can even recommend actions to take against the located individuals. In the infrastructure business, MAXR has recently delivered NASA a space bus for mission psyche that will be travelling to a resource rich asteroid between mars and Jupiter. As well as developing robotic arms for nasa's OSAM-1 mission. Whose goal is to service and repair satellites in orbit. (as a vast majority of satellites are non operational). Satellite repair and reconstruction could be a hugely profitable enterprise, as it would save costs on launching. \u200b Bullish arguments 1. Fundamentals. Fundamentally speaking, MAXR technologies is a very attractively priced company. The firm has generated revenue of 1.7 billion in the trailing 12 months, with a gross profit margin of 730 million, or 42%. Compare that 730 in gm to the companies market cap of 2.76 billion and you realize the firm is very undervalued. 2.7billion$ market cap/730 million annual gm=3.69 market cap/profit. Which is quite low. (to put in context aapl=19, pltr=65, ktos=16, mcd=17, amzn=18, intc=6). This essentially means that if you bought the entire business, you'd make your money back on just the profits in under 4 years. 2. Extremely difficult industry to enter, so threat of new competitors is very low. 3. Much of the firms business is with multi year, government contracts. So business is locked down for a while. This could be a downside if the company loses a major contract however. 4. Highly innovative company in a high growth sector. MAXR is the global leader in satellite imagery, No other company has nearly as many, or as important contracts with nasa and various defense agencies. Even Northrup-Grumman and Boeing aren't even close to MAXR when it comes to earth imagery services and advanced robotics engineering. 5. Strong record of delivering net income available to common stock holders. (A lot of companies don't do this). 6. Insider/institutional ownership. The firm is owned 66% by institutions, and recently awarded it's insiders 122,000 shares of stock options. 7. Technical analysis. The company is currently on a dip, after having found resistance around 41$ for months, before the stock offering. Bearish arguments 1. Debt positions. The company has a large amount of debt. With over 2.5 billion of long term debt. 2. Recent dilution via stock offering. The company recently financed their debt by selling 400m of stock. 3. shrinking receivables. Accounts receivable are lower this year than any time in the past few years. \u200b disclaimer: I'm holding calls on this company. \u200b Let me know what y'all think. I think the company is really undervalued, and it doing some extremely innovative and exciting things for satellite technology.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-04-11 05:05:39", "id": "mo9re4"}
{"text": "Position: 576@26.02 DESCRIPTION Charge Point is an electric infrastructure company that designs, develops & manufactures hardware & software solutions for electric vehicles at large. It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, & services for corporate, public, & residential customers. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries. History In June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States. The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's Electrify America to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model. BUSINESS OVERVIEW Market Cap: \\~$7bn Shares Float 299mln Institutional ownership \\~13% 2 Year CAGR Revenue Growth 65.65%; 5 Year 60%; TAM $190bn Newly formed entity has no Debt. Cash & Cash Equivalents \\~$650m. Exponential Revenue growth & estimated profitability in 2024 with 41% Gross Margin. Source: \ud83d\udcf7 $CHPT enjoys the [largest share for long-term reliability - Options for site hosts to use custom branding Software Enables \\- Control of who can use stations and when - All vehicles to get charged on time - Multiple vehicles to share power - Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied- Roaming integrations with other charging networks Challengers $VLTA; Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The things they don't do, are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better \"engagement\" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s & 6 L3. It's like chargers-as-billboards, selected to prime locations. Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it. SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a L3 offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential). $EVGO; EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers, and base their business largely on L3 chargers. AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1.4k L3 which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (\\~0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3. EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the L3 focus. $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:\"The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.\" $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): L3 focused company, it enjoys 2.5k L3 chargers. EM also sells a L2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software. Near Term Catalysts In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: \"AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.\" It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, former $CHPT board member is in current administration. That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet. Long Term Catalysts \\- Fossil fuel bans - Transit electrification dates - Incentive programs - All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology. $CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration. Miscellaneous $CHPT Apple Store rating: 4.6. $CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews. $CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app. In collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc. No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc. Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st. MOAT First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go) Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner) Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity) Network Effect ( \\~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries) CONCLUSION All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in ESG friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology. Yes most of its network is L2 chargers, but it's where most of the money is to be made. As users go to restaurants, malls, sports events/concerts, office, cinema, universities or just a Parking Lot! There will be L2 charger not L3 due to: Charger Cost Basis/Time Parked. Pretty straightforward formula. Why am I interested in $CHPT? Because it's an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry. Because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now. And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home \"GAS station\". Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations. A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what. This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & \\~13% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it?

March 15, 2021 short interest was over 39% (It's almost certain that anyone who has shorted this is under water right now...unless they opened a short at 3:53pm today, which is not likely). April 16, 2021 options: The $25, $30, $35 all have more open interest than any single strike in the put column. 18,973 for the $30 strike is massive volume for a stock that has 93% institutional ownership. The public float is 31 million Outstanding shares are 90 million The 18,000 contracts on the $30 strike representing nearly 2 million shares is pretty significant when considering the public float is only 31 million. If every strike closes ITM this will likely have somewhere in the 40,000 - 50,000 contracts closing ITM which is 4-5mm of that 31mm shares (7%) $ASO closed the day just over $29 / share and has moved up a little in after hours, nearly 30.

{"text": "Preamble: I suppose all of us have come across an analyst report while doing DD on a stock. Most of the reports that are freely available to the average investor are either dated or limited in access (we only have the buy/sell ratings and not the deep dive on the stock). According to this Analysis: There were a total of 66,516 recommendations made by analysts over the last 10 years for S&P500 companies. For the three sets, I calculated the stock price change across four periods. a. One week after recommendation b. One month after recommendation c. One quarter after recommendation I benchmarked the change against S&P500 and also checked what percentage of recommendations increased in value compared to the benchmark. I limited my time horizon to one quarter since analysts usually create reports every quarter and I did not want to overlap different recommendations. Finally, I also checked which banks made the best recommendations over the last decade. Results: Out of the 35K buy recommendations made by the analysts, the average increase in stock price across the time periods was better than the SPY benchmark with one week returns bettering SPY by more than 40%. Adding to this, I also benchmarked the percentage of times analysts made the call and the stock price went up vs the SP500 index. Sell recommendations given by analysts definitely have a short-term impact on the stock price. As we can see from the chart, the one-week performance of stocks that were recommended as a sell was lower than that of the benchmark. But this trend does not hold over the long term with stocks having sell recommendations significantly outperforming the market over the time period of more than one month. Another thing to note here is that on average even after the sell recommendation, the stock price did not fall. (ie, the returns were not negative) Which investment banks made the best recommendations?: I analyzed the returns of the recommendations made by different banks. The most number of recommendations were made by Morgan Stanley who made more than 2300 recommendations in the last 10 years. From the above chart, you can see that overall, the best returns were made by Barclays with their recommendations beating SP500 by more than 125% in one-week gains and more than 30% in quarterly gains. How much money should you be managing to profitably buy analyst reports? I did a rough calculation on the amount of assets you need to be managing to make sense for actually paying for the reports. From the above analysis, we could see that the analyst reports beat the market by 23%, and on average full access to analyst reports of a bank will set you back by $500K per year. Putting in the above numbers, you need to have a whopping $19MM of assets under management just to break even. Going on a conservative side, to comfortably make profits and not to have the analyst report fee considerably impact your returns, you should be managing at least $100MM. Limitations of analysis: The above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations. First, this is not the full list of recommendations made by these companies and are just the ones that were updated on Yahoo Finance. I also could not get any information on price targets made by the analysts to supplement my analysis. Finally, even though this analysis covers the last 10 years, it had been predominantly a bull run and this can bias the results in favor of the banks. This aspect could also be seen by observing how poorly the sell recommendations made by the banks fared. Conclusion: I started the analysis skeptical of the returns generated by recommendations made by analysts. There have been a lot of rumors and speculations about whether analysts have access to information the public doesn\u2019t. Whatever the case may be, the above analysis shows that if you have access to the analyst reports, you definitely can beat the market over the long run. Whether it's financially viable or not to access the reports depends on the amount of assets you have under management, in this case at least $100MM!

{"text": "I know that some of you are very mad, cuz you bought into the wsb hype, but what happened tha last 2 days is absolutely normal and actually should be expected. Despite the fact that some retail investors think that those kind of events are some huge catalysts, they are just events that are intended to show investors and potential customers the capabilities of the company's products. However, retail investors hype themselves up and buy the stock just before the event, cuz they either think that others will follow suite or that they will show some ridiculous, innovative technology or product. This of course does not happen, so they immediatly sell their shares, cuz they were in for the short-term anyway. At battery day Elon showed the huge progress that Tesla have made on potentially world-changing battery technology, but shares dumped by more than 15 percent the next day for the following reasons - 1- Tesla did not show an electric jet or a flying car 2. They did not understand anything about what was said and found the event boring 3.They were short-term traders that just played the catalyst. The same thing happened on the day that Apple showed the new Iphone- runup before the event and dump after. Both stocks are up big today. Now before you ask why didn't you sell your shares if you expected the share price to decrease, I will tell you. Most successful investors will tell you that if you actually believe in the long-term growth of the company, you should not try to time the market. I bought PLTR's CFD's (certificates for difference) at DPO and almost convinced myslef to sell at 15, cuz I throught that the rally will be unsustainable in the short-term, but I am glad that I did not do that and instead I sold at 30. I bought shares this time at 24 average price. Of course I know that even if you are a long-term investor you will still want the share price to increase in the short-term ( there is something called opportunity cost) and I personally would like it better if the company was more transparent with the media and investors, but it is what it is. Just remember that the share price will definitely increase only if PLTR accelerates its revenue growth and customer acquisitions, everything else is speculation.

Mods, thank you so much for letting me post it. If there's anything I need to do I'm happy to make any edits (no pun intended). The next post will be about their current drug pipeline. This DD series is the product of 80 hours of reading 10-k's, licensing agreements, court filings, and a lot of adderall. Intro What is crispr? Crispr stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats. It's a tool that is found in bacteria that can simply put can edit genes. Why should I care? Crispr is easily on of the biggest discoveries of the 21st century, and received a Nobel for its discovery last year]( and momma Cathie Editas is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on using crispr as a treatment for genetic disorders (in vivo), and for various forms of cancer (ex vivo). Their business model is actually pretty smart. They're targeting rare diseases for drug development, and licensing out the IP for crispr. Contrary to popular belief rare diseases are incredibly profitable, and easier to develop. You essentially can monopolize a disease, and the market is so small competitors rarely pop up. The IP though is going to be the breadwinner. Essentially any drug developed with crispr will give an 8%-13% royalty to $EDIT. Not to get too technical, but their technology platform is pretty revolutionary, and far exceeds anything else on the market who have so far contributed substantial funds towards the project along with resources. Others include sickle cell, usher syndrome, and a form of genetic blindness that are all in clinical trials. The patent $EDIT has the exclusive license for use of crispr in humans through the BROAD institute. There are 3 main universities fighting for the patent. This has been a decade long quarter billion dollar legal battle over who owns crispr that is coming to a close. To say the patent battle is simple is a huge understatement, and ( The catalysts Biotech has a lot of catalysts. It doesn't take a lot to send it to the moon. In the short term there's drug trials. ( Editas is scheduled to present this weekend at the American Association of Cancer Research's annual conference. On December 4th Editas presented data from their EDIT-301 trial, and then ( which caused the stock to go from $33-$99 the following weeks. This will be peanuts compared to when the patent is awarded which is why I believe shares, or LEAPs are the safest choice. The FDA was slowed by covid so I'm expecting biotech to have a big year as they catch up on trials. Positions 100 @ $23.56 10 $50c 4/16 1 $53c 4/16 20 $60c 4/16 I am long on shares, and will be buying leaps as the trial dates for the crispr patent gets closer. I bought some 4/16 calls because I noticed an incredibly bullish amount of calls for this week last Monday. Disclaimer I have a degree in molecular bio, and I've been following this closely for the past 5 years. A company that should be on your radar is Caribou Biosciences which unfortunately right now is private. Caribou has the patent for the use of crispr in non-humans which will also be an incredibly lucrative market. TL;DR: One of the most disruptive things ever only has a $2B market cap.

A phase contracts when the next 30-day ADV falls -45% compared to the previous 30-day ADV these numbers are arbitrary and were chosen as they seem to model the volume-phases reasonably well without picking up the noise Limitations: Coinbase Pro as a proxy for Coinbase, the main app's trading volume could also be substantial Trading pairs are a curated list and do not capture volume in totality Coinbase's fee changes remain unchanged [Source. It would be misleading to not comment on January 2018's phase contraction. The favorable explanation is July 2018 volume phase is \\~4 times larger than Apr 2017 phase. More so, the January 2018 cycle had 'altcoins' flaring to record high valuations, and are not entirely captured in the trading pairs provided. Additionally, the 2018 cycle likely did not have substantial institutional support that we are witnessing today # Coinbase Pro vs. Gemini This was a byproduct discovery, but Gemini's most recent trade volume seems to match the 2018 cycle. This to me implies that Gemini's user base has not grown aggressively as Coinbase's or its that institutional investors/traders have really warmed up to Coinbase. Bullish. # Volume Phase Breakout + Contraction How much does average daily volume change between phases? |Exchange|Average Phase Change|Average Phase Breakout|Average Phase Contraction| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Global|68.17%|157.4%|\\-29.17%| |Coinbase|54.16%|121.81%|\\-36.04%| |Binance|81.53%|152.4%|\\-12.95%| |Kraken|54.53%|129.3%|\\-35.19%| |Binance US|104.01%|148.87%|\\-52.97%| |Gemini|67.96%|178.26%|\\-32.31%| Average Phase Change: the average % change between phases (regardless of up or down) Average Phase Breakout: the average % change when a new phase is higher than the previous Average Phase Contraction: the average % change when a new phase is lower than the previous # Seasonality To confirm that Q1 (and Q2 estimates) can be used for Q3 and Q4, I perform a simple seasonality check. For each month since 2017: what is the average daily volume The Colab notebook contains the sum of USD trading volume by month There's no immediate explanation for why different parts of the year would have increased trading activity, therefore I assume that trading volume does not exhibit seasonality. # Forecasts and Price Targets Assumes that operational costs are $1 billion (Q1 2021 $1.8 Billion, 800 Million Profit) Volume contraction in Q2 is carried out for the remainder of the year (except for Neutral-Bear case) Using Coinbase Historical Volume Contraction |Case|Volume Contraction|2021 Profit Forecast|Share Price, if 50x PE| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Bull|0%|$3.2 billion|$800.00| |Neutral|\\-18.02%|$2.23 billion|$556.74| |Bear|\\-36.04%|$1.25 billion|$313.49| Using Global Historical Volume Contraction |Case|Volume Contraction|2021 Profit Forecast|Share Price, if 50x PE| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Bull|0%|$3.2 billion|$800.00| |Neutral|\\-14.585%|$2.4 billion|$603.11| |Neutral-Bear|-14.585% each Quarter|$1.77 billion|$443.09| |Bear|\\-29.17%|$1.62 billion|$406.23| Bull Case: the volume does not contract at all for the remainder of 2021 Neutral Case: the volume contracts half as strong as typical contractions, and holds for the remainder of 2021 Neutral-Bear Case: the volume contracts -14.5% quarter over quarter (Q2's volume is -14.5% over Q1, and Q3's volume is -14.5% over Q2, etc.) Bear Case: the volume contracts as much as typical contractions Rough formula: share price = ((1.8 + (1.8 Q2-contraction) + (1.8 Q3-contraction) + (1.8 Q4-contraction) - 4) / 0.2 50) 1.8 $1.8 Billion revenue Q1 contraction 0.8 = -20% volume contraction 4 subtract operational costs. Q1: $800 million profit off of $1.8 billion revenue, therefore \\~$1 billion operational costs each quarter 0.2 200 million outstanding shares 50 50x PE ratio target # Closing Thoughts (Apr 2021) The USD volume is exceptionally noisy and fluctuates aggressively. Tweaking the parameters can and will show an entirely different forecast. No one will know how, when, and where this volume-phase will end up; therefore approximating Coinbase's revenue via exchange volume has substantial risk. But with increased institutional adoption, balance sheet reporting, and favorable discourse around cryptocurrencies, my own impressions believe that we haven't seen the volume-phase 'top' and I believe the subsequent contraction won't be extreme as previously observed. When comparing Coinbase against its competitors, its doing well to continue its growth. Additionally, this analysis entirely ignores other coins, trading pairs, and the additional revenue streams expected by Coinbase. Despite the possibility of a strong volume-phase contraction, I believe this analysis provides a somewhat incomplete picture and does not factor in other bullish cases for Coinbase. In the words of Thanos, if we take each case as equally-probable, \"perfectly-balanced, as all things should be\", the expected value per share (average of each case) is between $556.74 - $603.11 (neutral case). I believe taking on risk head-first is a \"small price to pay for salvation\" # Positions 6x shares @ $383", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-04-20 07:45:21", "id": "mua3vo"}
{"text": "XLNX is merging with AMD. When the merger is complete, every XLNX share will be turned into 1.7234 AMD shares. The window for regulators to object the merger has passed. The last major hurdle for the merger is the shareholder meeting on April 7th. Currently XLNX is trading at $130 while AMD is trading at $81. With the merger XLNX is 1.7234 * 81 = $139.6 versus $130 (current stock price). There's an arbitrage opportunity, and on April 7th the biggest threat to that arbitrage is very very likely going to be removed. So what do you, an ape, do with this information? Well you buy XLNX calls expiring April 9th of course. It's mostly algos trading options at the moment, but it looks like right now you can buy calls at $132 strike price for $2 a pop, and $126 calls for $5 a pop, which are completely reasonably prices compared to their equivalent AMD options. But unlike AMD calls, you wouldn't need AMD to go up for this YOLO to pay out. If the valuation gap closes after the yes vote on April 7th, and AMD stays the same price, you make 350% and 160% returns respectively. And obviously , if AMD goes up a few percent over this week, you make even more. Full disclosure: I'm not a financial advisor.

{"text": "\u200b Encase you are wondering how these impressive results happened: 1) Lots of volatility on the the short sellers reports, when I got through the volatility, I kept trying to swing. My biggest success was I believe $20k to $159k. I think I actually added $20k again to the account AFTER it hit $159k but not entirely sure. Either way I am estimating the loss to be around $149k to $169k of unrealized gains, and a monetary/personal loss of over $30k. 2) Short sellers attack this stock alot. On FDA, it went up 70% premarket (but I have options), when I saw it was going down towards the day I was traveling and it kept going down. I was thinking a possible short squeeze would happen on FDA. Short sell volume and negative sentiment though was massive. The results: Trust me my personal life is falling apart and things aren't looking good.

{"text": "Hey, guys. I decided to bring out the ol' Excel to get some data on the SPY over the last 12-months to measure the money flow, and I found something super interesting. Money flow is essentially the inflow and outflow of money coming into a particular company, asset class, or security. It's a good way of measuring market participation. Higher market participation in bullish times often takes equities to new highs, but in bearish times it becomes a drag on equity prices. When money flow oscillates in tighter intervals, we tend to see more spikes in volatility rather than when it oscillates slightly or not at all. Let us take a lot at the SPY and the charts representing it. We have the price index, the total flows, the inflow(+) and outflow (-), and the net flow charts. Taking all of this information together, you may see where I come to the conclusion of why the market is overdue for a little more volatility, which means that VIX options are in play for the next few weeks most likely. This is the price index of the SPY on a per day basis over a 12-month period. We have reaching higher highs in the recent weeks while volatility has been dropping. This is a classic bearish sign for the market. Not to say that we will see a correction by any means, just a little bit more volatility, I think. Like I said, high volatility in a bull market is good. In a bear market, not so much. show where the CBOE Volatility Index \\(VIX\\) has stabilized. Since the last spike in the VIX around late January\\/early February, we haven't seen the VIX consolidate at a bottom. The data for April is only partially available because the month isn't complete, so do not take the line upward following the last turning point as a definite sign of stabilization. However, if we can assume that the final line going upward will average the current rate of return that is already there, then we may be due for a stabilization test soon.]( You can see the correlations between the VIX stabilization and the net flow peaks around the period by comparing the chart above with the one below. Based on this argument, I think we may start seeing the VIX consolidate at around this level. We're in a low frequency environment, the perfect spot for when high frequency starts to kick in. After a test of stabilization, we either see a sharp move upwards or the continuation of a slow decay before it gets retested again. Are we at a place of consolidation, or are we quickly approaching one? I don't know for certain, but I like to follow the money. \u200b Edit: Title: meant to say \"overdue.\" It's late.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-04-18 14:08:24", "id": "mt4xu3"}
{"text": "Hello my fellow apes, I have been a long-time lurker of this sub ever since I joined, but today I have decided to bring you a TA DD as of 4/29/21 price action for CLOV. As of 4/29/21, CLOV opened at $11.22 and closed at $10.17 with previous closing price of $10.50 (-3.14%). Clearly, our positive momentum was beat down hard yesterday. This was most likely due to two possible reasons: The market displayed a bearish sentiment in general against the medium/small/micro market caps while most of the large market caps was up (ex. FB) which explains why DOW, NASDAQ, and S&P 500 were all up by EOD. MVIS crashing hard which caused a ripple effect of panic selling across popular stocks like CLOV, AMC, GME, and MNMD. \u200b Daily chart of CLOV as crossing over the resistance level would mean we have a high possibility of testing the next resistance level of 50% at $12.34. If we continue a downward trend today (4/30/21) and go below the support line of $9.65, the 23.6% level will be shifted from being our support to a new resistance level. And of course, that's not a good sign since it would signify that there's a chance for us to reach back to the next support level of $8.53. Based on the historical trend, CLOV has been consolidating at around $8.53 and have been using $8.53 as a major support to bounce off so if this downward trend continues to spiral down, I would expect to see a bounce at $8.53 mark and rally back up. \u200b Elliott Wave Theory: Based on the Elliott Wave Theory, with yesterday's candle, it seems like we are heading into wave 2 which is a corrective wave. Today's price action will confirm whether we are officially heading towards a wave 2 or not. If today's price action confirms that we are in wave 2, I do NOT expect to see CLOV dipping further than $8.53 based on the explanation provided from the Fibonacci section and expect to see a bounce and reversal pattern to wave 3. In contrast, if today's price action shows a positive momentum, this will be a bear trap which means shorts will get fucked even more. With wave 3, I expect us to smash past 61.8% resistance level and face a major resistance test at $15.77 area. Wave 3 will be a key area for us to see how far our upside really is, but just know that if we smash past the resistance at $15.77, we will be able to test for 52-wk ATH price of $17.45 again. And if we cross over the 52-wk ATH price, sky is the limit for us and we are all going to the moon. As for the other waves (wave 4 and wave 5), expect to see an eventual healthy pullback from wave 3 and literally launch off to the fucking Mars by wave 5. I'm going to guess that wave 5 will most likely occur after the Q1 Earnings which is May 17th. That would mean that we will see wave 2 and wave 4 happen within the next 2 weeks. So, expect our journey to the moon to be a bumpy ride but know that the chart is absolutely bullish for the take off. \u200b Other: Golden cross pattern detected on the daily chart, highly bullish sentiment. RSI is centered out. Depending on today's (4/30) price action, we will find out if we are still in bullish sentiment or heading back to bearish sentiment based on RSI. Daily MACD chart is still looking bullish as MACD line is still above the signal line, reinforces the idea that we are still in the bullish phase. Triple bottom and we've bounced off every single time, another bullish sentiment. All around we are still seeing a lot of bullish indicators. Let's hope that yesterday's price action was a bear trap. \u200b ( \u200b ( Conclusion: All this speculation is contingent upon continuous increase in the volume level and buying pressure. Expect a bumpy ride, but based on my TA, we are primed to launch off hard. So, go tell your mom, your dad, your family relatives, and your friends to buy CLOV and hold instead of becoming paper hands and panic sell because if we hold, we are all going to the fucking moon. Tl;dr: We are going to the fucking moon, don't be scared of the setbacks and don't panic sell. P.S. Please let me know if you guys liked my TA and I might regularly post a TA DD on this sub! \\EDIT 1: I forgot to say that this is not a financial advice. This TA DD is purely based on speculation and has many contingent factors in order for the speculation to be held true. Please invest into the stock at your own risk.

{"text": "Trash my DD: This is my first DD, so by all means trash it, give me pointers, degrade me, etc I'm here to learn! I've seen a couple people a few months back lightly cover this company but without details. So, here's my take. \u200b TELOS \u200b What is it? An I.T. and cyber-security company that serves govt and large enterprise clients and focuses on leveraging cloud technology. End of 2020, going into \u201821, Telos switched their focus to product development, scaling, and deliveries. They didn\u2019t have any strong advertising or marketing strategies ending 2020, though they plan to drastically change that this year with a planned 300% increase on revenue from their 2020 advertising/marketing investments. Their biggest product, Xacta, is used by BIG names: CIA, DoD, National Archives, Department of Energy, Amazon, and Microsoft. Telos has been flying under the radar for the past few years, being used only by people like the CIA, because they\u2019ve wanted to focus on a niche customer-base and provide quality service, building up their business through hard work and a loyal, federal customer base rather than hype-- another reason you won\u2019t find out too much information on them through typical analyst ratings: they\u2019ve had a completely different customer-niche than usual companies. As they begin to spread into commercial organizations, more data will be released for the public to analyze. Now, as cyber-security becomes increasingly important, institutions are setting standards that security and I.T. companies have to comply with. These organizations outside of federal agencies are constantly seeking help to comply with these new sets of standards which Telos has mastered with their cybersecurity product, Xacta. Telos is the only player in the game with a product like Xacta. All eyes are turning to them for help with complying to these new standards. Roughly 50% of commercial organizations are set to adopt these standards this year, with Telos\u2019 product Xacta. Commercial companies/organizations everywhere are starting to do their research on who can help operationalize these standards and soon beginning to find out that Telos is the top dog in the game for it. The next venture of domination for Telos seems to be the educational sector. Unleash: Telos Ghost. The Ghost product actually aims to completely hide the school\u2019s network and cyber infrastructure from any outside or even internal threats as well as simply unauthorized users. Another goal of Ghost will be to completely prevent cyber bullying and hide the students and their assets, digitally speaking (very interested to see how the prevention of cyber bullying will be implemented into the security framework). Not only will Telos conceal the students and the school\u2019s digital infrastructure with Ghost, working with Telos helps with school audits, making the exhaustive process smoother and within compliance with security standards. As we mentioned before not many products, dareisay\u2026. Any at all\u2026 offer full security to organizations within the new set of security standards. Another factor that Telos has is the wifi networks they offer to educational institutions. It offers massive collaborative capabilities to the students and teachers, helping everyone achieve their goals together on the go with peace of mind of any security breaches on mobile networks. Looking at Telos as a stock, as of 4/19/21, institutional ownership has risen .1% to 27.6% and insider ownership has risen 16.3% to 26.6%. They\u2019re closest competitor is CSP Inc. which ended last year on a negative 1.45 million in net revenue, whereas Telos has actually ended 2020 with a net gain of 6.84 million. They only plan to increase their net revenue this year with the marketing and advertising investments they\u2019ve made. The net gain of 6.84 million is up from last year\u2019s negative 2.3 million and up from prior years as a whole, showing healthy signs of growth. Their revenue growth has gone up 20 million consecutively each year the past two years. Towards the end of 2020, Telos also signed a 10 year, 10 Billion dollar plan with TSA and their pre-check system. Coming into 2021, they\u2019ve even managed to go ahead and set up $75 million in deals with customers so far. They still have plenty of time to add a couple more deals in. Their revenue for the end of the year is projected to be between 283 million and 295 million, which is over a 50% increase in revenue compared to last fiscal year. Their earnings are projected to grow over 60% this year-- that\u2019s faster and higher than the u.s. stock market as a whole year to year. The return on equity for the next 3 years is predicted to be almost 30% (29.3%). Telos also has NO debt. The company actually just completed a \u201cFollow-On Offering,\u201d which is a great thing for Telos because all they were doing was simply raising capital shortly after having their IPO-- a completely healthy move, in fact, a very bullish sign (remember, they have no debt, so all it did was give them more money to work with for future projects).

Agreements with CVS, Walmart, Walgreens, Sam's club to present their ancillary teeth whitening product line that is normally given as a bonus to those who pay for the teeth straightening kit. This promotes brand awareness because they are on every shelf in America as well as a small amount of revenue. \u200b # Fundamentals SDC IPO'd just before covid and suffered as many other companies did during that time. Since then they have been growing QOQ, paying off high-interest debt by securing 0% convertible notes, bringing on power marketing players to the board of directors, and soon will be increasing their gross margins by \\~10%. \u200b 1.)

Marketing and New board members. Ted Ward has recently been brought on for his expertise in marketing. You may know him from developing Geico's marketing. Also as seen below, SDC has been growing significantly QOQ with a reducing Marketing budget. They are seeing a healthy referral-derived customer base. This is only expected to increase as SDC further expands its operations. [Less Marketing with Growth International Expansion. \u200b SDC has its sights focused outside of the U.S. where teeth straightening is unaffordable for most other middle-income workers. . \u200b # Technicals and Mechanics \u200b 1-year chart SDC 30% short interest. That's all. # Counter arguments. Weakness and Threats. 1.) Rivalry amongst existing competitors. SDC is up against every orthodontist in the U.S. that wants the process of getting braces or a clear aligner from $align to stay the same. This is affecting their pockets and unless SDC is able to continue building trust with orthodontists to use their product, sadly SDC will lose market share. 2.) Bargaining power of suppliers. Nonexistent because smile direct owns and operates the creation of the straighteners. 3.) Bargaining power of buyers. Yes, consumers have many different options when it comes to finding a way to straighten their teeth. However, find a company that provides the same service at the same cost as SDC. You simply cannot. 4.) The threat of substitutes. Yes, people could choose to decide, \"Hey I don't want straight teeth. It is what is on the inside that counts. He/she will choose me for my personality.\" 5.) The threat of New Entrants. Non-existent. SDC holds a patent on their process. [ I am long and hard.

{"text": "Okay so you've read the shitload of bullish god-tiered DD this company decided not to invest in any meaningful drug discovery. Instead they bought pipelines for well known compounds. Bonus, you can say on your website you already passed the \"pre discovery\" stage. No shit. It's done since the '50s. Candy-flipping is not \"next-gen\", sorry. Ibogain derivatives are not that good. The market : Psychedelics work, right? Yeah. For MDD (depression), they are only slightly more efficient than first intent antidepressants. And how efficient are antidepressants? Well not much. They have NNT ranging between 7 and 20. What's a NNT? Wait you were going to invest in a FUCKING BIOTECH without knowing what a NNT is? NNT (number needed to treat) indicate how good something is relative to a control. With a NNT of 7, an antidepressant will beat doing nothing 1 time out of 7. Yup. That's shit. Why? Because we know jackshit about how depression really works, and however smooth our brains are, it appears they still remain very complicated thing (I guess that's a good thing?).What does it mean? It means LSD, Shrooms, or whatever shitty therapy you can imagine with psychedelics will work for some and won't for the others. Which means MNMD will have to share the MDD market with the approx. 50 other fucking antidepressants. Also J&J's Spravato is less invasive and has better results. For anxiety. Is it gonna be the same? NO. MNMD is right on that one. The NNT of benzos is approx. 3 depending on the study. LSD is estimated to be around 2. That's nice. But don't pre-order your lambo yet. Benzos are fucking easy to use, and they are addictive. Many people won't tolerate psychedelics, won't have the time for it, or are afraid of the compound to begin with (thx war on drugs). The pharma industry won't let a hipster's biotech ruin its profits. So they'll either lobby against (if you are a physician it's good news, more free cruises in the coming years) or bring their own psychedelic drugs on the table (and they'll be better than acid). Acid antagonists will just compound problems. All their pipeline is based on the premise that they can safely stop a trip with this antagonist. Else the patient will be tripping balls for too long, making the treatement unpractical compared to other psychedelics and state-of-the-art anxiolytics. That mean pushing 2 pipelines plus a combined drug pipeline to reach market. For addiction. Didn't find anything bearish about it except that it might not get approved, like for any other biotech. ADHD. There's no exclusive market in selling microdosed lsd, but it might just work. The data isn't here to predict the success of the therapy yet. The IP : It's gonna be a fucking bloodbath. Almost all the psychedelic biotech decided to work with the same exact compounds because they are inept at innovation (more below). There gonna be a lot of overlap, and many lawsuits. Even better, almost all the IP I found related to the psychedelics applications is very badly written, and, put mildly, trash. Bullish on IP law firms. The people : In biotech, the idea isn't worth anything. Execution is the only thing that matter (and luck). So who's behind MNMD? They have anywhere between 25 and 40 employees depending on how you count, good thing if you work there outsourcing. Their current philosophy is \"throw money at it\". Which has been proven to fail in the biotech/pharma world, see eroom's law. What about the AI guys (the whole handful of them)? They come from the famous HealthMode (and also related Merlon) company. Never heard of them? Because they never put a product on the market.Basically the company is a weird employee merger between weed company veterans, an obscure 2 California based Czechoslovak AI companies and some expensive-ass consultant-executives. TL;DR : Mindmed is trying hard to appear as the next big thing but all they have is a highly contested pipeline of low-innovation drugs. They are stretched thin between Drug Development and AI and lack the proper verticality to achieve success, but are too high-level to succeed as an horizontal growth company.

Every week or so I've been keeping track of option prices at different strikes. When GME first lifted off to the Moon the market was pricing a dramatic move within 1 week. When it was at $325 around the end of January the 1 week move was plus or minus 40%. That means a 1 week option at a strike of $325 cost about $130. As you can see in this chart, the options market is not pricing in a big move anytime soon. The expected $ movement week to week has been getting smaller and smaller. \u200b [Call Option Data.

That said, I've sorted out how RobinHood closes positions on expiration. I'll walk you through the rough logic on the server side, then explain how to keep them from closing positions you want to hold until close like a true degenerate. At 3pm EST their system starts the following sequences; 3:00 - Does user have an option expiring today that they do not have funds to exercise? If yes, cancel sell order and notify user. ~3:04-3:09 - Sell all options expiring today that are OTM and users do not have sell orders for, or are ITM but not enough buying power to exercise. Sell at bid. 3:10 - The process starts over, and repeats the previous process. This is every ~10 minutes as far as I can tell, until 15-20 minutes before close. At this point the process is restarted every 5 minutes roughly. So how can you hold something until close? Create a limit sell order above the bid, and as soon as you are notified that your order has been cancelled you need to create a new one.

Well my second \ud83e\udd48 round of boomer deep dives is for you. Last time we talked about \ud83d\ude82 this time \ud83e\uddf0\ud83d\udd28\ud83d\udc77\ud83d\udea7 So out in Dallas Texas there is great Dividend giving company called Eagle Materials \ud83e\udd85\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf2 Let's look at their profile compared to competitors in the construction materials field. Eagles Materials Revenue: $1.2 billion Revenue growth: 15% Profit Margins: 20% Employees: 2200 PE 16.37 Martin Marietta Materials Revenue: $4 billion Revenue growth: 3% Profit Margins: 12% Employees: 8800 PE: 28.92 Summit Materials Revenue: 2.33 Billion Revenue Growth: 5% Profit Margins: 6% Employees: 6,000 PE: 23.28 Looks like they have far lower price to earnings with better growth and better profits. They also get a bit more out per employee. Effecient and growing \ud83e\udeb4. This is what we want in companies! Now for one of the key points on why this is a 2x buy check their financial filings: In their annual report they reiterate the intention of the company to separate their heavy and light materials divisions into entirely independent publically traded stocks. Why are they doing this? Because the board and CEO know their stocks are undervalued and a major shareholders they are tired of it. Splitting the company means you get two stocks with an undervalued PE ratio in more concise markets. Easier to prove value and easier to get investor intention with a big move. Those two stocks aren't staying down and even if they evaluate close to properly compared to their competition you are already close to a 2x deal! But that's not all. It isn't just that Eagle is in a good position now, the market puts them in a good position long term to succeed. 1. Materials\ud83e\uddf1 are scarce\ud83d\udd0e across the board right now. Everyone is behind on deliverys due to COVID related disruptions and the economy reving up too fast. There is no fast solution to the backlog which means guaranteed revenue stream for over a year AND efficient companies benefit the most by having room to gain market share. On top of that material suppliers are getting the opportunity to line their pockets with a bit of extra revenue since there really isn't competition for customers in this market. Many companies aren't even taking on new customers right now because they are already stuck managing allocations for their existing base. 2. Commercial Real Estate is going down hard. \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f\ud83d\udd87\ufe0f\ud83d\udcc9Office space in major cities is coming to an end and nothing can stop it. Companies now know they need less office space and less people in the office so they aren't going to fork out anywhere near as much leasing space in expensive locations like NYC, LA, Chicago, etc. The restructuring\ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f needed to account for this will require materials and materials you need for these conversions are the exact types of Products Eagle offers\ud83e\uddf1. Clear case of forward looking demand. Boomer Points: 1. While it is true that millennials probably couldn't hang dry wall if their lives depended on it \ud83d\ude34Joe is going let \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfd\ud83c\udf2e back in and they can definitely help with all the labor shortages in the construction industry. We may soon be back to the days where you can pay they nice gentlemen outside home depot to come help you finish a project no questions asked. Don't have to worry about shithead contractors not showing up for quote. 2. \ud83e\udd85 is a legimate company that offers their employees pensions, stock options, and solid wages. People who work there want to work there. It isn't like my job at Wendy's. This is a company where talent stays. 3. Dividends \ud83e\udd29!!!! You can grow your shares more by having shares! Cons: 1. Commercial Real Estate crash might bring down everything in the real estate and construction market for a while. Depends on how much bag holding the commercial landlords insist on doing. If they don't recalibrate quickly or decide to beg for bailouts we might see a mini recession in that market with lots of empty spaces and no activity to refresh or maintain. 2. Lots of upside for construction materials is priced in and Eagle has already beat market growth for the year. However PE still says they don't meet the competition so this probably not substantial.

Indeed, the NJ Census Bureau estimates the US online gaming market to be worth 30 billion dollars by 2030. ||Draft Kings (DKNG)|Golden Nugget Online Gaming| |:-|:-|:-| |Type|Sports-Betting Focused|iGaming Focused| |States Active (Online Sports Betting)|12 States (25% of US Population)|2 States (6% of US Population)| |Population Coverage (iGaming)|4 States (10% of US Population)|2 States (6% of US Population)| |Market Access Secured|NA|10 States Total (26% of US Population)| Why Golden Nugget Online Gaming: Extremely Profitable iGaming is also extremely profitable -- more so than fantasy sports. Disregarding customer acquisition costs, gross profits can be as high as 80%. ||Draft Kings (DKNG)|Golden Nugget Online Gaming| |:-|:-|:-| |Annual Revenue per User (ARPU)|$51|$633| |Breakeven Point (CAC Recouped)|14 Months (E)|5 Months| |LTV/CAC (36 Months)|\\~3.5x (E)|\\~5x (E)| As we can see from the above chart, Golden Nugget Online Gaming has monetized their users extremely well, with Golden Nugget Online Gaming being the market leader. The numbers also shed some light into the respective focus games and demos of each firm. Golden Nugget Online Gaming targets an older, wealthier, demo that is less technologically savvy - this would explain higher CACs and ARPUs. On the other hand, DKNG targets a youngest demo with sports betting rather than iGaming - this would explain why it has lower ARPUs. In addition, gaming companies can maximize margins by scaling, or offering up higher value products. Traditional brick and mortar casinos make the majority of their profits from slot machines (which explains why floors are typically covered with slot machines). This is because they control the odds fully, there is perfect informational asymmetry, resulting in abnormal profits per play. On the other hand, games like sports betting, while more accessible and engaging, include an element of 'skill'. The odds are not fully within the control of the gaming companies, and hence margins are lower compared to games like slots. Older demos prefer chance-based games like slots. Younger demos have a larger aversion to gambling, but are open to 'skill'-based games like sports betting. Golden Nugget Online Gaming has substantial iGaming operations compared to sports betting operations. This explains why Golden Nugget Online Gaming is a better fit for the older demo and hence substantially more profitable. In short, DKNG is a great bet for the Gen-Z/Millennial-demo, and Golden Nugget Online Gaming is a great bet for the silver-demo. Why iGaming: Permanent Shifts in Consumer Behavior Are you heading back to the mall? I sure as hell aren't. The digitalization of most industries has accelerated by nearly 10 years. These shifts to online gaming are permanent. While about a third of the United States is within 25 miles of a casino, we can confidently say that up to a quarter of the US will have access to an iGaming site within the next decade. Online gaming provides users with increased convenience, enhanced and immediate sociability, and may allow them to escape the stigma associated with traditional gaming. These permanent shifts in consumer behavior therefore suggests that many analysts are underestimating the growth of the iGaming market. This would explain why most firms are beating consensus estimates. Why Golden Nugget Online Gaming: Trading Comparables ||Draft Kings (DKNG)|Golden Nugget Online Gaming| |:-|:-|:-| |Market Cap|23.1B|1.1B| |TEV/Total Revenue|34.8x|8.3x| |TEV/EBITDA|Not Profitable|26.1x (Profitable)| |LTM Revenues (M)|614.5|91.1| |Current TEV / 2022 Revenues (E)|16.5x|3.4x| Retrieved from Capital IQ. AAA 31 March 2021. As one can see from the comparable listed above, Golden Nugget Online Gaming is dramatically undervalued vis-a-vis DKNG. The average industry TEV/Rev ratio is approximately 9X. Collectively, this implies an upside of at least 2.6x for Golden Nugget Online Gaming. One thing to note here is that Golden Nugget Online Gaming has historically been very conservative with their revenue growth projections (and tend to exceed investor expectations). In fact, they only projected a \\~20% revenue growth for FY 2022. This contrasts with the \\~50% growth rates for DKNG. If we assume 50% growth for FY 2022, this brings their TEV / 2022 Rev to just 2.5x. By extension, trading like DKNG would mean an upside of up to 6.6x for Golden Nugget Online Gaming. Why Golden Nugget Online Gaming: Execution Golden Nugget Online Gaming is a pure play iGaming company. Unlike its primary competitor, Caesars Gaming, it has the support of a large number of physical locations, but do not have these locations on their balance sheet. This makes it asset light, nimble, and ready to take on the digitalization challenges of the next decade. Golden Nugget Online Gaming is majority controlled by the same entity that owns and operates 5 Golden Nugget casinos across the US. In exchange for 3% in royalties, it gains access to a 2.5M strong database of loyalty customers. In addition, Golden Nugget Online Gaming has the ability to leverage on 600+ Landry\u2019s restaurants across the US, with 3M+ potential members and land based coverage that reaches 60%+ of the total US population. Indeed, Golden Nugget Online Gaming's access to existing networks are competitive with some of the biggest players in the US. \u200b |Operator|Number of Loyalty Members| |:-|:-| |Golden Nugget Online Gaming|2.5M Casino Loyalty Members + 3.5M Restaurant Loyalty Members = Up to 6M Strong Network at Launch| |Draftkings|15M Fantasy Sports Users| |Flutter-Fanduel|10M Fantasy Sports Users| Indeed, these strong networks will allow Golden Nugget Online Gaming to launch in up to 6 new states by the end of 2021. Why Golden Nugget Online Gaming: Potential M&A Target Finally, Golden Nugget Online Gaming is a potential M&A targets. Compared to DKNG, it is a much leaner company with lower (and more digestible) valuations. As the industry moves from analogue gaming to iGaming, existing operators without a foothold in or access to iGaming will view Golden Nugget Online Gaming as potential M&A targets. In addition, both firms are attractive targets, in my opinion, to European and Asian gaming firms without market access in the US. Risks 1. This is an intensely competitive market and is likely to be a winner-takes most market. 2. Successful execution needs to be combined with increased market access in order for firms to grow. 3. Expansion may slow post-COVID. Conclusion The Golden Nugget was one of the oldest casinos in Vegas. Old is turning new once again. The gaming industry has been ripe for disruption, and Golden Nugget Online Gaming is leading the charge for iGaming. iGaming poses a real and viable threat to existing incumbents, and is a much more attractive alternative to sports wagering for older demos. Golden Nugget Online Gaming is to boomers what DKNG is to millennials, and is a strong buy at current price levels. \\----------------------------------------------------------------- PS: Thanks for the support Thanks so much for supporting my posts!

More importantly, these are not just temporary spot rates, but we are seeing a plethora of charters signed for 2-3+ years at these elevated levels.

Even after the huge surge in the stock price, the enterprise value to EBITDA valuation metrics are very attractive since 2021-2022 EBITDA is surging and net debt levels will also be much lower by the end of 2021. As I noted above, containerships are not like tankers and dry bulk vessels which normally just get 60-80 day voyages. These ships are landing 2-3, or even 4+ year fixtures.

{"text": "While everyone has their grand day off (including me, even though honestly I should be at the desk because the mortgage/TBA market is still trading), we have the currently most important piece of data to come out of the United States. (as an aside, right now NFPs are 1st, even though I can see CPI inflation becoming the most watched in the next couple of months) Those are the non-farm payrolls. Basically employment numbers, or how many of our fellow apes have finally hit 0.00 on the account and now gainfully employed and contributing to society through manning the Wendy's counter. The more wagecucks, the more spending. The more spending, the more companies have to hire wagecucks and so on. I fully expect a blowout number, well above the 647k which is what we're playing with (expectations are set at 650k, so the higher it is, the more unexpectedly bearish for fixed income, and the lower it is below 650k, the more bids there will be for fixed income). Why? March takes into account the massive jump in vaccinations. This also plays into the fact that in March, around 20 states have increasingly lowered their age restrictions for vaccines. Every reasonable business owner sees this, and because there is a certain 1-2 week or so lag between interviews. Remember in March 2020 when everyone is trying to front-run the dips, June/July front-run the recovery, and now Citadel trying to front-run the RH GME Diamond Hand Apes? This is the same thing but now in the employment market. And this time, all the job gains are in the service industry, the same industry that vomited jobs as we entered the lockdowns. Do you need someone with skills to flip burgers? No. This is all low-hanging (easy to train, no need for previous experience) fruit that's about to get harvested not by hand, but with an industrial thresher that will make your mom blush. Companies are able to hire truckloads of these $7.25/hr minwagecucks because they're cheap, and this time they're needed. In every economic cycle, low-wage service sector jobs are the first to get dumped off the cliff, and first to get shoveled back in. We're just seeing the start of this. What does this mean for: Equities: all these boomer/doomers need to STFU and go suck Cramer's ass hair. A rising yield is good for equities because if a treasury is pulling in 2%/yr RISKFREE, equities need to go higher. Why did tech do a 10% correction during the last 10yr jump from 1.5% to 1.75%? Because no one expected it to go that high. Now my fellow retards at the office and I are expecting 2% to hit as early as June, and so is every other person I'm talking to (mostly my mom). 2% is as good as priced in right now, and because everyone is expecting it, I do not expect an equities tantrum... unless we somehow cross that line and go straight into 2.5% Bonds: this has what I've been mostly doing, apart from some ag and metals. Simple as that - yields go up, bond prices go down. No need to worry about blah blah how this will translate into growth. From basically the realization that the US is going to lead the way with vaccinations, this thing has been going straight down. \u200b Why tomorrow? Equity markets are closed. The treasuries market will be open, but extremely light in volume. Any blowout number, coupled with no one to trade may lead to a vaccum, amplifying single direction moves. Perhaps we might even get a rare circuit breaker on /ZN (10yr treasury futures) is around 5%. I know it's 20yr vs 10yr but srsly the duration should not mean you're paying 3x as much for volatility.

{"text": "Recently, I've diversified my portfolio and put it all in AMC. Personally, I think AMC has a ton of potential for several reasons: 1. 99% of AMC theaters are now open, and the pandemic has eliminated many of their competitors. Plus, there is a international surge in movie crowds as the pandemic seems to be slowing down 2. AMC is a great momentum stock almost certain to climb higher. It has gained 96.33% this past quarter while the S&P have only moved up 2.3% respectively. 3. AMC has a zacks rank 2# (buy) ranking, basically saying that its positive earning outlook could easily translate to buying pressure which in turn would push the stock up. Alright, these are my reasons, and whether you agree or not, thanks for reading and please comment on your thoughts. P.S This not necessarily financial advice, nor am i a financial expert, this is just my humble opinion of the stock. Edit: So a lot of people have been talking about the pandemic and how watching movies at home is the thing now, so I just to point out 3 things: 1. AMC at some point may shift their marketing strategy so we should dismiss it's growth off the the way it is operating now. 2. Also, watching movies at home is not the same as at a theater, the screen is not as bigger and the experience as a whole is different. (Think imax and 3d stuff). Plus, people have been binge watching netflix the whole pandemic, by now they are probably ready for a change. 3. Lastly, when it comes to the pandemic, people are getting vaccinated and they are getting more used to social distancing and masks. The point is not that people will cram back into theaters. They will come back with safety measures (social distancing, masks, etc ) and more importantly, they will feel safe and comfortable with this new normal.

They just did a 700 million note offering that was supposed to available til April 7th but had already been bought up by the largest banks with J.P. Morgan buying the biggest percentage. This is very good for uwmc. Now another reason why the stock is trading low is because of shorts and no it will not have a short squeeze. Most of the daily volume from the last 2 weeks had been shorts. My theory is they are keeping the share price lower to get a bigger dividend bc it free money. The dividend pay date is April 6th. And most analysts have a price target above 10 but we all know analysts sacks of shit but on this one they are right for once.

{"text": "Lumber Sector First of all the lumber sector is booming right now so the lumber companies have been doing very well because of it. Right now lumber prices are skyrocketing as we are seeing lumber futures above $1000 once again making new all time highs. Lumber is in high demand as covid has caused a lot of these companies to not be operating at their maximum so there is a shortage on supply. A lot of these companies stock prices have surpassed their 2018 highs while others are nearing it. A big reason why lumber stocks peaked in 2018 and have decreased since is because of the new laws and regulations that have caused higher tariffs on their revenue, sales, etc. In 2020 the new stay at home lifestyle has caused people to take on new projects such as building a new deck for their backyard, or renovating their house as a whole. Canada has seen a huge housing market boom because of the shortage of supplies and people have been upgrading their houses to put in on the market and make a profit. Not to mention the increased immigration once Covid settles down which will spark a increase in building of new homes. Lumber prices won't be going down anytime soon and I believe it'll maintain these prices for 2021. Lumber Stocks Right now I see a company that is severely undervalued when compared to its competitors and that is Canfor Corporation, $CFP on the tsx. \\Note all numbers are expressed as millions of dollars\\ \u200b Canfor 2020 Financial Reports Summarized yet is trading at nearly the same market cap. \\- Canfor and West Fraser have nearly identical revenues and net income yet West Fraser is trading at an 11 billion market cap while Canfor is trading at a 3 billion market cap.

{"text": "Alright boys, disruptive tech has been hit hard, so buy the fucking dip and either go broke or get rich with me (thanks be to Jpow). I think ROOT is a solid disruptive tech play that will hit so hard it may even make the fact that people buy 10-year treasury bills at these yields in the face of inflation make sense. ROOT is an insurance tech (or insurtech) company, which is considered the \"next big opportunity after FinTech,\" as the insurance industry is considered to be at a \"key inflection point\" in a pivot to insurance tech companies (source is pretty, can do everything related to the insurance (e.g., filing a claim), and most importantly, is quite good at picking important stuff out. For example, it can determine whether you're the passenger or driver in a car, or if you're biking, taking a bus, or taking a train (source ratio. The PSG ratio is similar to the PEG ratio, except it works really well to measure the value of growth stocks rather than stocks of mature companies (which are typically better assessed via PEG). A stock's PSG ratio is calculated as its price/sales ratio divided by its 3-year or 5-year sales growth, expressed as a percent. Prior work published on a site I can't link (I can't link the site that seeks alpha, right?) found that stocks with PSG values between 0.00 and 0.20 consistently beat the market, whereas negative or higher PSG ratios than 0.20 underperformed. ROOT's PSG ratio is 0.06 (3-year growth) or 0.11 (5-year growth) depending upon whether 3- or 5-year growth is used as the denominator. How does that compare to other growth companies? ||P/S/G 3-year|P/S/G 5-year|Sales 5-year Growth|Cash Flow 5-year Growth| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |RKT|0.01|0.01|54.8%|\\-17.0%| |ROOT|0.06|0.11|51.6%|39.2%| |ASO|0.08|0.14|3.5%|21.9%| |AMZN|0.15|0.15|29.3%|46.1%| |SQ|0.19|0.24|49.6%|14.3%| |ZG|0.21|0.24|39.0%|\\-6.4%| |TSLA|0.48|0.37|50.8%|45.5%| |COIN|0.50|0.89|19.5%|92.1%| |SHOP|0.75|0.68|70.2%|102.1%| |LMND|0.76|1.39|33.2%|18.0%| As you can see, ROOT's PSG is absurdly low: lower than AMZN's and many other popular growth stocks\u2014though not as low as RKT's, which is stupid low, but its declines in cash flow hamper enthusiasm for its sales growth. In addition, its growth is matched by huge increases in cash flow. In every backtest I've done or seen, a PSG this low is very likely to outperform the market over the next year. # ROOT is extremely undervalued compared to its only publicly traded peer ROOT's primary publicly traded peer is LMND. They're different companies, in that LMND offers homeowner's/renter's/pet insurance but not car insurance, whereas ROOT primarily focuses on car insurance but has been expanding homeowner's/renter's insurance. But they're both insurtech companies in their growth phase and can be compared somewhat. ROOT's 5-year revenue growth is almost twice that of LMND's, and ROOT's cash flow growth rate is over twice LMND's. Additionally, ROOT's price/sales ratio is 5.85 and LMND's is a whopping 46.34. Accordingly, ROOT's PSG ratio is about 1/12th the size of LMND's (remember, smaller is better). If ROOT was valued at LMND's P/S ratio, it would be trading at $86 per share. If ROOT was valued at LMND's 5-year PSG ratio, it would be trading at $134 per share. These are a bit extreme (LMND is overvalued by any metric), but this further illustrates that ROOT is extremely undervalued. # Analyst consensus points to 77% upside for ROOT Usually I don't give a shit about analysts because their recommendations are awful at forecasting stock prices. I know some people like analyst consensus, though, so I figured I'd mention it. Out of 13 analysts, 4 give a buy recommendation, 8 hold, and 1 sell. The consensus price target for those analysts is $19.23, which equates to a bit over 77% upside over the current share price. # Insider purchases of ROOT are very bullish Over the last six months, insiders have bought a combined $12.5 million shares of ROOT and sold $2.8 million. Looking at those sales on Fidelity, many of them were automatic sales. Insiders sell stock for all sorts of reasons, but they only buy for one reason: they think that the stock will go up. And insiders have put a net $10 million of their own money on that over the last six months. # ROOT has a number of high-profile institutional tech investors I probably don't care as much about institutional investors as I should, but I know some people care about them a lot. ROOT's institutional investor list includes the high-profile tech investment firms of Silver Lake, Dragoneer, Coatue, Hillhouse, Tiger Global, Whale Rock, Durable Capital, DST Global, Redpoint Ventures, and Ribbit Capital, among others. # ROOT is a founder-led company ROOT's CEO is its (co-)founder, and a Harvard Business Review study found that stock prices of founder-led companies in the S&P 500 outperform stock prices in other companies in the S&P 500 that are not founder-led by a factor of 3.1x (source. This outperformance could be because founder-led companies tend to be more innovative (source. Most often, highly shorted stocks are highly shorted for good reason: they might go bankrupt. But ROOT isn't about to go bankrupt. It's a growth stock with extremely high YoY growth and strong increases in cash flow. Our good friend Andrew Left of Shitron finally figured out how to work his webcam, but more importantly for this DD, published a report--if not substantially higher. In my absolute stupidity, I consider shorts on a company that isn't going bankrupt to be longs that just haven't bought yet. Literally can't go tits up? # ROOT has a strong moat ROOT's moat is not primarily in their app (which I personally really like). ROOT's moat is mainly in their enormous amount of collected data and, even more so, machine learning algorithms trained on those data to predict accidents. They have patented their tech for tracking and analyzing device behavior, aka their telematics. These pieces of intellectual property are quite strong, and they allow ROOT to profit from selling nonidentifiable data to interested parties, in addition to ensuring that any other company that wanted to do what they do would need to collect data for years in order to achieve the same level of accident predictiveness that ROOT has. # Technicals on ROOT indicate a good entry point I fucking hate crayons but I know some of you kids like them. ROOT recently had a bullish breakout of a descending wedge that it had been stuck in since December. See below. # Potential downsides and bear cases ROOT is embroiled in some legal battles related to alleged misrepresentations of the company at its IPO. These misrepresentations supposedly include misrepresentations of customer acquisition costs and the relative advantage of ROOT relative to other insurance peers in telematics data and data engagement. The lawsuit also states that an analyst has alleged that ROOT will not be cash flow positive until 2027 and will require, in the analyst's opinion, significant cash infusions. There are three main responses to this issue that matter as far as new investors are concerned. First, it's likely that this suit was filed because a law firm wants to make a name for itself; suing new tech IPOs is trendy receives complaints about ROOT at a higher rate than most companies, though ROOT did improve on this in 2020 (82 complaints received) relative to 2019 (122 complaints received). In 2020, the NAIC assigned ROOT a Complaint Index score of 1.84, which means that the NAIC received 1.84x more complaints against ROOT than would be expected for the number of drivers they insure. Searching insurance subs for ROOT, it seems that most of the complaints against ROOT are related to rate increases--which they do if someone drives riskier than previously, or if the value of cars around them increases. The fourth potential downside for ROOT is the same one facing all of disruptive tech: Yellen hates America and Powell is racist. But in seriousness, rising interest rates due to runaway inflation would hamper expected future returns of ROOT and any other disruptive growth stock. \u200b \u200b TLDR: ROOT is a deeply undervalued, rapidly expanding company in a rapidly growing industry. It has all the qualities it needs to succeed long term and is at an excellent entry point. \u200b Positions: 5/21 $10c (5x) and 4900 shares at $11.95 avg because I want to be a boomer.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-04-29 07:32:46", "id": "n0o3re"}
{"text": "is a perfect ally on this because they support free and open markets.\u201d Weeeeeeeeird. Do you guys think it's \"big cannabis companies\" like TilAphria or other large LPs fighting the interstate commerce, or maybe ones like Trulieve who are desperately clinging on to their dying business models? If interstate commerce is allowed, it will cost LPs only shipping costs to send their products to all 50 states, and their juicy markets. They already sit on an excess of product and grow space, just waiting for bigger markets. Meanwhile, Trulieve spent 60m+ on 2 retail stores, then diluted. \ud83e\udd26. So whatever markets they just spent 60m on, will eventually be available to everyone else (LPs and MSOs) for the cost of shipping to their stores or other new stores in the same area, post legalization with interstate commerce. No real long term cannabis company is focused on building a retail focused business. Just ask Curaleaf (read their ER) why their EU expansion is so exciting. They have no intentions of vertically integrating AND INSTEAD are building large manufacturing and distributing centers to serve large regions. Ya know, like Coke or Marlboro or Corona or literally any other CPG giant. Y'all been in a Coke owned store lately? Hm. How about the Corona ones? Hm.... Well, surely the Marlboro store? Those are everywhere!...... The kind of the interesting thing about the switch from a medical market to a recreational market is that 100% of the time, some of the the biggest opponents of the switch from medical to recreational are the current medical companies. Why would they want a bunch of new competition, regulations, and taxes? They don't. They fight the bills in the name of \"patients rights\" or some other made up bullshit. Then there's the other side of the coin. Once the switch from medical to recreational finally does happen, medical companies tend to find a lot less recreational companies wanting to work with them than they'd like. When you have to sit on the sidelines while someone else builds a monopoly, you aren't too keen to help them. Recreational business owners aren't stupid either. They are fully aware of those helping reinforce the \"status quo.\" So, imagine you were to open a recreational marijuana dispensary after waiting for years in Florida, and a Trulieve sales rep walks in with their shitty logo on his shirt, how likely would you be to put their products on your shelf? I mean, why would you when there would be countless other brands to choose from with no retail presence? You wouldn't. It would make no sense. People who want Trulieve product can just go to a Trulieve store. Plus, wouldn't you purposefully notcarry the same thing as your direct competitor, and especially their own in house brands? Unless you're \"Cookies,\" I just don't see that happening, and Trulieve AINT \"Cookies.\" From a customer or \"patient\" perspective, in Florida, are you going to a Trulieve store for the 1,536th time after legalization, or \"Starbuds\" that just opened down the road with \"100+ new brands!\" sign out front? Best case scenario would be Trulieve also adds a huge new line of other companies brands to their shelves, but is that really good news for them? They'd lose say 30-60% of their shelf space across all 70+ stores. That's gonna cause a surplus of weed for them pretty quickly. They currently make so much money because they essentially own a monopoly on stores, and a monopoly on products within those stores. You want weed and live in FL? There's a 50% chance you're going to a Trulieve store, and a 100% chance you'll get a Trulieve product in that store. I've never seen something more \"priced in\" in my entire life, yet people still think Trulieve is going higher. Trulieve is only $40+ because of the current market regulations. Take away the favorable regulations, and you take away Trulieve, and get TruShit. Post legalization, each Trulieve store will just be one of X amount in a town selling weed. Florida currently has a dispensary ratio of around 1.1. Fully legal states have ratios closer to 10. Thats 10x the competition, just to get customers in the door. Even if they do come in Trulieve's door, they may not even buy a Trulieve product since they would be forced to carry other brands as well as their own. Not every MSO is fighting for a fully legal market, and it's pretty obvious to point out the ones who could potentially be hurt the most by a free and open market. TruShit being king among them. In my retarded opinion, wholesale focused MSOs and LPs are much much much better long term options for a legal market. Stop investing in a dying medical market, \ud83e\udd37.

{"text": "So AMD. Long awaited and slightly delayed 2 DD on AMD This possibly a long read for anybody with an attention span lower than 50 seconds and needless to say it will contain words that you were not taught in 5th grade. You read the following summary if you happen to be a drooling neanderthal Summary Great business, getting better, smashing Intel in coming years, price is low ,gonna surge, buy fucking ape Performance and demand We are now on going through a cycle of extreme demand for products that facilitate digitalization, EV\u2019s, pc, datacenters expanding. This has all been accelerated due to the covid cause all you dumb fucks have been watching 4k Pornhub filth from you mums basement, while pausing the newly acquired PS5. Those of you with a job perhaps thought working from home would require a new laptop and what have you. AMD delivers the chips for all this. AMD doesn\u2019t make the shit slow useless chips but the high-end stuff which the market just can\u2019t get enough of. Take look here from last year: ( Notice the gross margin rising a bit whilst revenue is up 45% Y/Y. The numbers and performance are both completely ridiculous. And the FCF here killing it \u200b And their official outlook from last earnings: ( Most analysts though have higher expectations than the guidance from January. Can\u2019t blame them. AMD will in coming quarters buy XLINX and expand their business to other segments in the semi conductor industry so there is plenty of room for further growth on the outlook. \u200b Supply and competition TSMC is the main foundry supplier for AMD. They have kept prices intact but there are so far rumors that they might hike them soon enough. Last year many of the sites were shut down and capacity hasn\u2019t met the surge we have seen late quarters. The problem is not exclusive for AMD but it\u2019s the same for most of its competitors. They have stated though that they expect to be back on track for 2022. Intel got hammered last week in earnings with losing market share in datacenter segment and margins absolutely murdered. AMD has been trading inverse to Intel basically as the market expects AMD to be one of the main causes to Intel's howler. However let the bears beware of the CEO\u2019s lady Su\u2019s own words live: \"we have enormous demand, demand is very, very strong\" continuing their seeing record growth in multiple areas including PC, gaming and datacenter. Lisa added: \"to answer your question, it's good -- it's very good\" [ Now ask yourself if that\u2019s something a smart insanely well performing CEO would say 6 weeks before an earnings report if the shortage was really smashing the business. My cents are on her being right and even a bit conservative on it. Analysts Market analysts are quite divided on the target ranging between 70 and 135. The best rated one here Hans Mosesmann has a price target of 120. Look at his bull following here: As for my positions I hold a few calls but mostly shares. I think this is a long-term case but earnings could be a blow out like last summer that caused the stock price to explode. Its a bet if you fancy but If you buy leaps you are defo safer.

{"text": "I recently did a HUYA DD post and I recommend reading that one first here: [ This post will make papa Burry and DFV proud. The fact that institutional ownership shows as 121.4% everywhere for HUYA stock made me go down this rabbit-hole. I really wanted to be lazy and gloss over this fact but not today. If you check out the following link: [ You will see the current institution stat is: 100,952,393 Total Shares Held. This makes sense as the current share float to the public (including institutions) is around 83.491 million shares. (121.4% of the float) Per my previous DD post and per the above screen shot 34.4% of the float is shorted which is 28.72 million shares. Let's be conservative here and assume that 100% of the shorted shares are institutions playing the arbitrage strategy. Subtracted 28.72 from the public float of 83.491 gives us 54.771 remaining shares. Now the fucking crazy part is that if you take the overall institutional ownership of 100,952,393 Total Shares Held minus 28,720,000 you get 72,232,393 shares held as long holds. The float size is 83,491,000 and if you subtract out 72,232,393 you get 11,258,607 shares remaining. This 4.4 billion dollar market cap has 11.256 million shares out of the 83.491 million shares owned by us retail gamblers. Practically the entire company is owned by inside investors and institutions with an incredibly small amount left over for us to play with. It is insanely shorted.

{"text": "Hello fellow degenerates. VZIO IPO'd last Friday and it appears to have flown largely under the radar which I'd attribute to all the other crazy shit happening last week. I didn't even know about it until shares were already for sell. The shares went on sale in the 17-18 dollar range, way under the proposed 21-23 range. Seeing this looked at the numbers and bought some shares because I thought they were impressive. I'm just gonna throw it out there that I am not a financial expert and this is my first time reading numbers from a prospectus document so if you see any logical errors or bad numbers please point them out. I'll largely be using the numbers I got from the prospectus document found here: [ As of last Friday VZIO has put 15.2 million shares for sale on the market. The company's total shares outstanding as of 2020 was \\~144million (these aren't on sale, just held by inside investors). At the current stock price of 24.5 that puts the company's market cap at about 3.5 billion. According to RH VZIO's current P/E is about 4.45, which is insanely low for a well known brand and a growth stock, which leads me to believe the stock is majorly undervalued. The stock price could easily quadruple to put the P/E around 20 which is more inline with competitors. The last couple of years VZIO has transitioned from being just a hardware company selling TVs to also becoming a streaming server provider. Because of the low margins on this service it has become a huge income stream for them and a source of extraordinary growth. Think of their streaming service like Roku, but actually built into the TV. VZIO's income and revenue for the past couple years were: Total net revenue 2019 $1,836,799,000 2020 $2,042,473,000 Total gross profit 2019 $165,165,000 2020 $296,358,000 Net income 2019 $23,086,000 2020 $102,475,000 The net income increase was largely due to the profits from their Platform+ revenue which has grown 304% from $36.4million in 2018 to $147 million in 2020. The CEO states that the company plans to reinvest that money into the hardware side of the business to develop better TVs. Another bonus is that the CEO has deep ties to Asia manufacturing which has proven to be extremely helpful in them securing required components for their TVs and keeping their supply lines healthy while competitors face shortages. Taken form the prospective document as of December 31, 2020, Vizio had $207.7 million in cash and $625.8 million in total liabilities. Vizio's recent financial results can be summed up as follows: Increasing operating profit and margin (They are making more money and making more money with less cost) Growing topline revenue Sharply increased gross profit and gross margin Growing earnings * Reduced cash flow from operations The HD TV market is growing and expected to grow substantially in the next few years. As of 2020 Vizio also made up the third largest brand of HD tvs in American homes, so it has massive name recognition. VZIO has a lot of big rivals to compete against in this growing market that may try to take out the smaller competitors. The name recognition might help VZIO's potential for acquisition by a large player seeking to quickly enter the Smart TV/connected home market by buying out an established brand. In the past VZIO has shown it is willing to sale. It was supposed to be purchased by a Chinese company a few years ago, but the deal fell through. In the short-term all the stimulus will likely keep demand for TVs purchase high, which makes short term prospects for VZIO look pretty good. The long-term potential for growing their operating margins through streaming services, a ever growing TV market, and the potential for buyout makes them a solid place to park some money. TLDR; The company is profitable, growing in the streaming segment, increasing earning, and has all the right ingredients to become a big player in the next generation of connected TVs by offering a TV + streaming service similar to ROKU but in one piece of hardware. Also, there's only 15 million shares on the open market so a lot of demand can cause a big increase in the stock price in the short term.

{"text": "Blink Charging (BLNK) is a small cap American EV charging provider with a value of 1.45 billion. It has been rallying from a around $1 dollar to a yearly high of $64.00 but in the last couple months has dropped in value by almost half to $34.00 due to a rising short interest amongst hedge funds to around 41% making it one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the Nasdaq right now. Not sure what hedge funds are short but I feel there are a few reasons for this. The main reason for this is that there are a number of other competitors that are making inroads in the market and that BLNK is relatively small amount of market share at 8% at current. Chargepoint is the largest in the market. Although I feel that that what the hedge funds have overlooked is that there should be room for loads of companys in the EV charging industry. The sheer rate of growth in the EV market has driven this company up 1200% and that has potential to keep going. BLNK has implemented a total of 15,760 charging stations and Apple has added all these stations to its Apple Maps which is massive for the company. We also should not underestimate the radical change to the global economy where clean energy is going to overtake traditional fossil fuels. America has a target I believe of 2035 for the phase out of fossil fuel transport while most of Europe has pledged to transform its economy to be carbon neutral by 2030 with EVs playing a major part in that shift. This indicates that there is huge upside for the company in the coming years.\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c Below I have highlighted a few of the fundamentals that are interesting and may look familar here including the current short interest (42%) and the current float 32 million.

My apologies for not posting this yesterday, but Reddit, with their extreme ethics (?) put me in a corner for 3 days for upvoting a couple of comments my daughter made about motorcycle safety. Good to see their priorities are in order, An upvote from the same NAT, that's way more important than employment background checks on pedophile enablers, right Reddit? Given that last week's DD was my first complete WHIFF (seriously, embarrassingly bad, but we'll get into that), I'm going to work hard to find a layup for everybody next week. Think I've found one, but with that tax bomb President Harris tossed out yesterday, I don't want to name a new ticker, even if I think it's all smoke (because the mere act of sabre rattling can shake a market, and there's sure to be plenty more of that in the coming weeks as the administration attempts to normalize the plan to create the actual highest cap gains tax rate in the world). So instead, let's go back through the DD's (the ones I haven't deleted because they were no longer effective, at any rate) and update them and where I am with them. This should hopefully, for at least a day, stop people from grabbing a DD from 2 months ago and jumping in then wondering why the trade is different. Oh, who am I kidding, I know you fucks, nothing will stop that. At the very least, it should shut up the small group of people who played the trades wrong and declared them broken. Let's start from February, so right after the first round of people who \"liked the stock\" # DD #1: $PLTR. Original Date January 27th, 2021 \u200b I tried to tell you retards was wildly overpriced based not only on their market cap as a company who's almost every dollar is already priced in as a result of their reliance upon government contracts, which span years, their reliance upon the courts to force those contracts to be extended, but also because the company insiders were selling stock like mad, George Soros had signaled he was going to sell the 4% of the float he controlled for \"ethical reasons\" (hah!). Oh, and because Peter Thiel participates in the wrong type of political ideology amongst the tech elite, that he was so unfavored that there would be active attempts to harm his ventures. Original price target: I stated the company was worth no more than $22 and that people should open $25 puts expiring in late March. In later comment updates, I stated that one should buy puts any time the company strongly eclipsed 25, and should buy calls any time the company sinks to around 22, as that's its rangebound territory. How did it work/what has changed: Not a single thing. It was literally impossible to screw this trade up unless you went against it. So, of course, most of this sub did just that and lost money. What the smart play is on it today: I no longer buy puts in $PLTR, but any time I see it creep to 22, I buy a biweekly $22 call. Easy money that I will then put on the end of a fishing pole and hold over the head of a Palantard. Trade rating: 10/10. 15 bagger (and counting), plus you got to point and laugh at half of this sub. # DD #2: Weed Stonks. Original date February 3rd, 2021 (a non-Friday DD) \u200b URL: Right here these stocks instead of invested in them, you probably fared pretty well. All the weed stocks peaked a week later and then started their decline (except for $APHA, which continued to rise for a while before collapsing as it tried to find equilibrium w/ $TLRY). My own results were originally mixed on this. I made a lot of money scalping Sundial before getting out of the way at the top and laughed as it collapsed to the surprise of a million braindead stoners. I made some pretty decent money on TLRY, made quite a lot on APHA (and then gave it all back and then some on a stupid play for the merger that expires on the 30th, a nice 7 figure waste of money), and made some money on Organigram, but I kept the 1/22 $5c's and am reasonably certain they're a complete loss, but just like bagging Olivia Munn, there's always a chance. What the smart play is on it today: Don't touch any of them. The reality is, long term, these Canadian companies are going to have a hard time penetrating the US market, even if the product is federally legalized. But, more importantly, the one thing every weed company has in common with one another is that they are absolutely TERRIBLE at execution. This is why you don't make stoners CEO's of publicly traded companies just because they're passionate about the product. They've got the easiest product out there to sell, and no matter how low you set the bar, they somehow find a way to trip over it. What you should play instead if you want to get in this space: $MO. Yeah, you heard me, $MO. Think about this a moment: These guys sell tobacco. A product that they are forbidden from marketing or even talking about, which gets hidden away behind cages in stores, which has been completely wiped from movies that might product place or even being MENTIONED in public because of regulations. A product which in some places it's illegal to use in your own home or alone in your vehicle as you take a 10 minute break from your soul-sucking job and question every choice you've made in life, just hoping to get 5 minutes of sweet relief before you have to head back behind the Wendy's to finish your shift....and they STILL sell billions of dollars a year. Say what you will about their product, but these fuckers know how to execute. And they're already in America. You don't think that they won't be at the front of the pack when that shit gets legalized? You don't think they won't give up the brown leaf for the green leaf? You don't think they won't start buying up every Ganja Goddess or Chronic ReLEAF store they can find once they're allowed to? Fuck outta here. Trade rating: 8/10: You made money if you followed it and got out a week later, you made even more if you caught how lukewarm I was on the entire sector and picked something else, and you saved a lot if you got out of Sundial like I said, but the weed play really died out a very short time later, so the upside was very limited. # DD #3: $BB. Original Date February 12th, 2021 \u200b URL: Right here, bitch-o and has no competition, extrapolated long term earnings potential of a company pivoting from phones to secure automotive and fleet management. Original Price Target: 87.50.....in 2023. My positions were very early, so my average PPS is 7.67 and my calls are 5's, so not really playing the same game. I have since added, over time, a load of 1/23 42c's at an average cost of like 80 cents. How did it work out: Thesis still holds, though it would sure be nice if the green number reflected a mammoth spike in equity price. The only reason this company isn't sitting at 20 right now and well on its way to smart vehicle dominance is because of the damned chip shortage. What the smart play is on it today: It's still buy and tuck away in a hole somewhere like a Boomer. Grab the farthest out, farthest OTM calls you can find (they should be no more than 50 or 60 cents). You'll still be a massive disappointment to your parents, but maybe you'll be able to trick them that you're starting to grow up enough to where they'll let you move out of your refrigerator box and housesit for them when they go on a cruise. Hey, speaking of.... Trade rating: 5/10: I expect this one to age like wine and ultimately be a huge profit maker, but the chip shortage was a resistance point I failed to consider so it hasn't seen the immediate burst. # DD #4: Cruise lines. Original Date February 19th, 2021\ud83d\udcf7 \u200b Not mine. But I wants it., etc. People in these from the date of posting who didn't just buy and hold likely have turned at least a 6 bagger by now. This trade was, and to some extent is, still solid gold. What's happened since then: In spite of none of the companies in question needing to issue shares as they had enough cash on hand, $RCL issued shortly after that DD, $CCL immediately copied them, and $NCLH followed suit a couple of weeks after $CCL. At least none of them tried to pull an $AMC and have the CEO go on TV and give zero credit to retail investors for saving the company and instead taking all the credit before diluting and then paying himself a fat ass bonus for doing nothing but issuing shares like some sort of conquering hero. The amount of the dilution in question meant that the resistance price of (to use as example, $NCLH) of $32 a share already represented a higher price than the pre-virus share price. Ditto for the other 2. Investors haven't seem to have noticed, however, and these stocks still trade in the general range, though the resistance level is now more like 31/25/85. Also, the sailing schedules for the domestic cruise ships has been pushed back as a result of somebody high up at the CDC obviously shorting these stocks, as that's the only explanation for why they're so focused on trying to send these companies to 0 by preventing sailings. Norwegian is resuming cruises outside the US in the next couple of months. What the smart play is today: These 3 companies are no longer as attractive as a result of the dilution, but they're still good swing traders within their respective channels. I'd put up a picture of some charts to show those, but I already told you where the resistance is, grow a wrinkle and learn where support is. I have since exited my positions in $CCL (and was never in $RCL), and have drastically reduced my holdings in $NCLH, but I do still maintain a skeleton crew of January calls for them. Trade rating: 9/10. It was really hard to fuck this one up, unless you just didn't believe me. And it's still a live trade. The only thing I could have done better was post it sooner, but I make sure my trades are established and going the right way before I talk about them in depth. # DD #5: The Semiconductors: Original Date February 26th, 2021 \u200b And before you ask, yes it is. Took this the other day when I decided to start working on this. In retrospect, should have washed first., the real action was in the commodity level chipmaker space, specifically American companies (or companies that could masquerade as them) who would line up to the trough to get some free government money to go from being nofab to fab companies. Original Price Target: $NXPI 200-210 within 3 months; $ON to within 43 within 3 months, $MRVL to 75 within that same range. And I didn't give a price target for $UTZ, just that it would go up. How did it work out: LAMBOS for almost everyone! Supposing you could order one, given that they can't get the chips they need to build the cars. $NXPI got to 214 before pulling back to 202. $ON hit 43 2 weeks before I predicted it would. $MRVL failed to live up to expectations and has been essentially dead money since that posting, but if you'll recall I was very explicit that I was bullish on them ONLY as a 5G play, whereas the others I felt had more range and scope. So short-term $MRVL play was a loser if you moved up the timeline I liked. Oh, and $UTZ printed for everybody that just bought in because they liked the product. It was a nice little pocket play. What's happened since then: The trade ran its course to perfection. As I've been saying for a little while now, semis, with the exception of $NVDA, are not presently an interesting trade because there's been a rotation out of them after this period of growth. I am still incredibly bullish on the sector as a whole, but they need a breather and some time out of the sun before continuing a leg up. They're not even good rangebound trades right now. And LOL @ any of you clowns who bought $TSM anyways because Cramer and his cult of Shortbus All-Stars told you they were the best in breed. Suckers. In the case of $MRVL, they acquired another company and now are going to \"officially\" become a US company instead of that tax dodging shit they've been pulling, which means the thesis about them lining up for gubmint money is sound and will happen down the road. What the smart play is today: Ignore semis till at least June; probably July. I have exited out of all of my positions and have taken immense profits from the commodity semis. I similarly got rid of my $NVDA calls at the top, though I am willing to find a re-entry point in the 575 range if it happens. Don't be sad that the trade is over, be glad that it happened and you might have been there. Or at least be happy that I was there and am appreciative that I got to stack a bunch more paper I'll never spend. Either way. Trade rating: 9/10. Absolutely perfect call, with only $MRVL being the laggard, but it came with the appropriate warning. # DD #6: $CLNE. Original Date March 5th, 2021 \u200b URL: Got buried in a mountain of Gibbons doing dumbass \"DD\" on their stonk and, if you re-entered after taking profits, you've either been averaging down lately as this has been getting unfairly dragged down with the entire green energy sector or else you're underwater on it....but you'll still be fine. What's happened since then: A LOT. From them getting dragged down from the mid 15's all the way to below 10 on nothing but good news to them signing major partnerships with $BP, Total and Citgo, to signing a half a billion dollar deal with $AMZN to power their long-haul fleet with RNG to Washington DC flat-out stating that methane capture is a capstone of their green energy plan, there has been nothing but good news coming out of this company. And yet It got absolutely PUMMELED with the sector for the last month, and then this past week started Monday morning up 27% only to not only give all of those gains back but lose another 20% by the close of trading Tuesday because of a combination of market manipulation by a hedge fund that shorted the stock into oblivion for a hit and run (do a search on my profile by posts and look up my Wednesday discussion if you want to be absolutely fucking infuriated that someone borderline committed a crime) coupled with them paying off an analyst at RayJay to run a hit piece on the $AMZN deal to try and sink the stock price even lower, right down to that hedge fund suppressing the price of the stock for 2 weeks to keep it under $12 so the most popular options for April would expire worthless. This company has, in short, been subjected to a biblical level of fuckery that was probably was some Mortimer Brothers bullshit for a $1 bet, and it's still standing and ready to spring. Oh, and somebody informed me that they got some airtime on Cramer's show on the 24th. Jimmy Retard is luekwarm on them, and you should always inverse him, so balls to the wall, baby. Especially since he tried to compare the 2009 version of this company (when nobody gave 2 shits about nat gas) with the 2021 version (where governments are going to force people into this type of product and the transport industry is finally transitioning away from oil). What the smart play is today: My thesis, as written back then, is EXACTLY what I would write even today. I stand by every last thing in there, including the strike date and price, in spite of the hedge fund bullshit that artificially tanked the stock for no reason other than unmitigated greed. It was my favorite stock in the whole market then, and it still is now, just balanced against the knowledge that, as a very small midcap bordering on a small cap, it's easy to push around and very clearly fucked some hedge fund manager's wife or something. If you don't believe me, every analyst out there says this company is worth double what it's at now. My original position still exists, except now it's bigger and I'm also the owner of a lot (and I mean a LOT) of shares on top of it that I was gobbling up like a porn star eating all the money shots in an episode of Blacked on Tuesday and Wednesday. Trade rating: 10/10. Nobody was talking about it before that DD. You made a multi-bagger in just a few days if you jumped in, and even though you're battered and bloody right now on the 2nd run with them because of the manipulation from a hedge, you're still going to make mad tendies with this one. They've got EVERYTHING going for them, corporate America is looking to them for the carbon negative fuel as an easy way to lower their footprints, no competition other than a shitty (4 letter word for non IPO company) building their first capture plant who has NO fueling depots or infrastructure, politicians demanding carbon neutral fuel and, unlike most of the sector they reside in, actually have a product and make money. # DD #7: $BE. Original Date March 12th, 2021 \u200b URL: Lazy bitch can't even search for it yourself? will start buoying the stock price How did it work out: I said buy shares and tuck them away. The stock hasn't really moved since that DD, and should still be tucked away. The condition for their recovery (increased air travel) has not yet happened, therefore, it's not their turn yet. What happened since then: People have continued to be afraid of their own shadows. Especially the Europoors, even though England no longer even has enough cases to qualify as being in a pandemic. Dumbasses. What the smart play is today: Same as it was then. Buy shares. Hold. My positions haven't changed. Trade rating: 4/10. Their turn for recovery is taking forever, but it'll get there. # DD #9: $NVTA. Original Date April 2nd, 2021 (no DD the week before) \u200b The thesis: One of the few biotech companies in the world worth betting on long term. Transformational technology, market leader. Also, gave me an opportunity to collaborate with Cathie about the stock (though, because of my, to be charitable \"un-PC\" vernacular, she declined to put her name on the DD). Original Price Target: 50 by mid June, 60's by 2021 How did it work out: We're now officially in the space where the long-game trades are still developing and can't yet be judged. The stock, typical of every biotech, has been very choppy in this uncertain market. It opened up big a couple of days after the DD, but has drifted downwards since that point. The volatility still makes it a great intraday scalper, and the thesis is still sound. What happened since then: The rotation away from high multiple high growth stocks has continued, especially after President Harris proposed increasing the cap gains tax to the highest in the world. What the smart play is today: I stand behind the DD and thesis, and the entry points are still attractive. I would move the strike price down into the low-mid 40's, however. My position has not changed. Trade Rating: Incomplete. Still developing. I was very clear this one was not for the faint of heart. # DD #10: $NEE. Original Date April 9th, 2021 \u200b URL: You're late, but here you go. I exited my positions near the top and stacked all the money in an air conditioned, humidity controlled room that consumes immense amounts of coal power. What happened since then: The share price has started to pull back, which was expected. Further, they had an earnings call, and you should almost never play earnings in this environment. What the smart play is today: This trade is effectively finished - it was predicated upon a rebalance, the rebalance happened, it was a lot of fun, we all made lots of money. This is still a really well run company but the short-term thesis is no longer valid. The DD will stay up only as a display of the company's operations, margins, and overall growth potential if you want to act like a Boomer and be a long-term investor. I pulled out all of my short-term positions, and only maintain shares at this stage. Trade rating: 10/10. Took even less time than expected for the trade to complete, and was never in any danger of doing anything but printing tendies. No matter when you bought leading up to the rebalance, your position was green and stayed that way the whole time. # DD #11: $ISRG. Original Date April 16th, 2021: \u200b URL: Thus proving I'm not the Zombie Jew ran its course before Friday. Analysts had been lowering expectations for $ISRG for weeks, and even management was saying things to make it seem like they were going to have a subpar quarter. Which made sense, given that a lot of operating theatres are still closed. Price Targets: As it was an earnings play, didn't list any long term, but suggested going long in a company that typically only melts upwards when the stock fell by 60 or 70 bucks. How did it work out: Not even slightly. At all. Absolutely TERRIBLE call. They blew the doors off earnings, beating by more than a dollar those lowered analyst expectations. Sales were up. Procedures were up. Everything was up. Instead of going down 10% on weakened guidance, the stock shot up 5% and blasted through all-time-highs. This was a big time loser of a trade. So why did it happen: I can't take credit for digging this up, that credit goes to /u/Farmer_eh who did all the sleuthing of HOW they pulled it off. It turns out $ISRG accelerated depreciation on a lot of their production equipment, and also had an increase in inventory. This means that they had a bunch of extra Da Vincis laying around in a warehouse and were selling them to medical centers at a steep discount, which is why they sold so many more robots than any analyst expected (30% more than pre-COVID sales), and also lowered their expenses for the quarter. These are neat tricks that a company can only pull every so often, and it was smart of $ISRG to not only have that one in their pocket for a rainy day, but also the wherewithall to play the card at the best possible moment. So, in a way, the thesis itself was sound and the quarter would, in fact, have been a down one had they just been organic about it all, but I failed to account for easily accomplished accounting magic and motivated sale pricing to ensure a quarterly beat. Which is something I'll remember next time I think about shorting a company that beats on quarterlies almost 90% of the time. What the smart play is today: The original DD talked about letting the stock price come down and then going long, because this is a company that is mostly always going to go up. However, it's run up so fast after those earnings that even long is a dicey play now, so this is a company that, if you aren't already in, you should probably stay away from. However, buried in that DD was commentary about how $PLUG had been beaten down to the level I wanted to see it go to already, and that it was time to go long in them. I've had a couple of you message me, showing that you had read between the lines, to say you covered your puts after that and went into calls. So those are paying off. As the green energy sector is starting to rebound a bit, $PLUG will naturally get caught up in that, so there's a play there. Trade rating: 1/10. It was going to be a 0, but, as mentioned above, if you had read between the lines there, there was a secondary play buried in there about $PLUG calls, so I'll give 1 single, solitary point on this otherwise complete dumpster fire of a call.

{"text": "Alright let\u2019s get right into this. $ASO known as academy sports and outdoors is a large nationally run sports equipment n shit like that store. I\u2019m poetic I know. Academy has 259 stores nationwide but wants to see that grow to over 800. They just report earnings this week and absolutely SMASHED earnings. EPS projected .46, actual was 1.09. They also beat revenue projections from 1.56B to 1.6B not much but still improved. Their net sales was 5.69(nice)Billion a 18% increase over the prior year. In comparison Dicks sporting goods, which has substantially more stores only improved 9.5% yoy. Considering the fact that all of last year basically every single sport was canceled and yet they still destroyed earnings has me happier than a kid on Christmas morning. Every single team sport that was shut down last year is back for business this year baby which means more money for $ASO \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11.

{"text": "BlackBerry stock: It\u2019s still a sexy play in my books BlackBerrry\u2019s collaboration with Amazon.com Web Services (AWS) is truly something to get really excited about, global agreement to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud. Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences. BlackBerry IVY addresses a critical data access, collection, and management problem in the automotive industry. Modern cars and trucks are built with thousands of parts from many different suppliers, with each vehicle model comprising a unique set of proprietary hardware and software components. These components, which include an increasing variety of vehicle sensors, produce data in unique and specialized formats. The highly specific skills required to interact with this data, as well as the challenges of accessing it from within contained vehicle subsystems, limit developers\u2019 abilities to innovate quickly and bring new solutions to market. BlackBerry IVY will solve for these challenges by applying machine learning to that data to generate predictive insights and inferences, making it possible for automakers to offer in-vehicle experiences that are highly personalized and able to take action based on those insights. BlackBerry IVY will support multiple vehicle operating systems and multi-cloud deployments in order to ensure compatibility across vehicle models and brands. It will build upon BlackBerry QNX\u2019s capabilities for surfacing and normalizing data from automobiles and AWS\u2019s broad portfolio of services, including capabilities for IoT and machine learning. BlackBerry IVY will run inside a vehicle\u2019s embedded systems, but will be managed and configured remotely from the cloud. As a result, automakers will gain greater visibility into vehicle data, control over who can access it, and edge computing capabilities to optimize how quickly and efficiently the data is processed. With BlackBerry IVY\u2019s integrated capabilities, automakers will be able to deliver new features, functionality, and performance to customers over the lifetime of their cloud-connected vehicles, as well as unlock new revenue streams and business models built on vehicle data. \u200b \u200b For instance, BlackBerry IVY could leverage vehicle data to recognize driver behavior and hazardous conditions such as icy roads or heavy traffic and then recommend that a driver enable relevant vehicle safety features such as traction control, lane-keeping assist, or adaptive cruise control. IVY could then provide automakers with feedback on how and when those safety features are used, allowing them to make targeted investments to improve vehicle performance. Additionally, drivers of electric vehicles could choose to share their car\u2019s battery information with third-party charging networks to proactively reserve a charging connector and tailor charging time according to the driver\u2019s current location and travel plans. BlackBerry IVY could also provide insights to parents of teenage drivers who may choose to receive customized notifications based on insights from vehicle sensors when the number of passengers in the vehicle changes, when the driver appears to be texting, distracted, or not observing speed limits, or when the vehicle occupancy level rises above the parents\u2019 desired safety threshold. Similarly, parents of infants could receive a reminder to engage the child safety lock when the vehicle detects a child in the rear seat. BlackBerry IVY will enable automakers to compress the timeline to build, deploy, and monetize new in-vehicle applications and connected services across multiple vehicle brands and models. Instead of investing in one-off solutions that conform to the unique engineering of different vehicle models (as they do today), automakers using BlackBerry IVY will be able to leverage different types of data as common building blocks for new services that could work across a range of models. Automakers will be able to use the platform\u2019s application programming interfaces (APIs) to share data and outputs with their software development teams, giving them the ability to innovate, while also protecting customer privacy and security by controlling whom can access vehicle and app data and at what level of detail. In addition, BlackBerry IVY will make it easier for automakers to collaborate with a wider pool of developers to accelerate creation of new offerings that deliver improved vehicle performance, reduced costs for maintenance and repairs, and added convenience. For instance, by analyzing real-time performance data, automakers could recognize the first signs of potentially faulty parts, deploy code to identify affected vehicles, notify impacted drivers, and perform targeted recalls. Automakers will be able to remotely deploy and update the software from the platform\u2019s Cloud Console (a web interface for managing BlackBerry IVY) to continuously improve the functionality of the system. \u200b \u201cData and connectivity are opening new avenues for innovation in the automotive industry, and BlackBerry and AWS share a common vision to provide automakers and developers with better insights so that they can deliver new services to consumers,\u201d said John Chen, Executive Chairman and CEO, BlackBerry. \u201cThis software platform promises to bring an era of invention to the in-vehicle experience and help create new applications, services, and opportunities without compromising safety, security, or customer privacy. We are pleased to expand our relationship with AWS to execute this vision and deliver BlackBerry IVY.\u201d \u201cAWS and BlackBerry are making it possible for any automaker to continuously reinvent the customer experience and transform vehicles from fixed pieces of technology into systems that can grow and adapt with a user\u2019s needs and preferences,\u201d said Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, Inc. \u201cThrough this joint effort with BlackBerry, we will provide automakers with the insights, capabilities, agility, and speed they need to thrive in an increasingly connected world. As automakers seek to race ahead in their digital transformations, BlackBerry IVY empowers them to build their brands and set the standard for connected vehicle services across the automotive industry.\u201d The future looks bright for BlackBerry \u200b \u200b I believe the collaboration on project IVY with Amazon Web Services (AWS) could evolve to become a major needle-mover for BlackBerry stock, as it continues to push toward meaningful organic growth to finally prove itself to the skeptical analysts that maintain their hold ratings and single-digit price targets. BlackBerry stock has collapsed, yet IVY is still happening, and contrarians should be as excited as ever as the company looks to spread its wings in the auto market, which may be on the cusp of exploding higher on the back of EVs (electric vehicles) and autonomous driving technology. Although the QNX business hasn\u2019t recovered as quickly as most investors would have hoped, I still think BlackBerry stock is a great value bet for those willing to put up with turbulence for the next three to five years. Looking ahead to the post-pandemic environment and things are likely looking up for QNX and many other segments that have fallen under pressure due to COVID-19. Add IVY into the equation and I think BlackBerry may be shaping up to be one of the greatest Canadian turnaround stories of all time. TLDR Stay the course and put your trust in the hands of CEO John Chen, and I do think you\u2019ll be happy with the rewards to be had over the next decade. The stock is likely to yield meaningful fruit over time. \u200b Not a financial Advisor etc..", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-04-26 22:16:15", "id": "myvben"}

{"text": "Good Evening, The song for this post is Silver by Bonobo. Put it on and listen up. Jump to the numbers part if words bore you. I want to start out by thanking, - This will be approximate It is important to understand where the shorts are in regards to an average price. Until the shorts are underwater is highly unlikely that a squeeze will happen. From now on we are going to round up and start with 20 as a baseline. Tuesday March 30th - Day After Earnings. Avg $ SI - 9.4 Here's the proof thank you @zackstrades. Average $ SI 9.2 So for the past trading days we have seen an average of 6 million shares collected sub 9 and the rest collected between 9 and 10. Trading above 10 was very short lived and we probably collected .5 million total SI during that time period. Total Previous to earnings SI average is 20 m at 15.5 (generous to shorts) Total Post earnings SI is 20m at 9.2 . 15.5+9.2 is 24.6/2 = Total SI for 40 Million shares is a cost average of 12.3.

Additionally, the larger shorts could absorb a lot of the momentum if its smaller accounts that blow. Also u/jn_ku gives some caution \" so the question is going to be whether the people who bought at, say, $14.50 to $16.00 feel good enough to ride the rocket up past their buy-in, or they sell as soon as they hit their break even after being underwater for so long trade volume above that point drops off, so if price gets past $16 I can see it going to $25, which is a bit beyond the prior ATH if the volume is still going strong at that point for beyond $25 it would have to be a catastrophic margin call type event for the biggest shorts, who might actually be some of the market makers \" I think that means \"Shorts are Fuk\"....

{"text": "DiDi is a Chinese vehicle for hire company headquartered in Beijing with over 550 million users and tens of millions of drivers. The company provides app-based transportation services, including taxi hailing, private car hailing, social ride-sharing and bike sharing; on-demand delivery services; and automobile services, including sales, leasing, financing, maintenance, fleet operation, electric vehicle charging and co-development of vehicles with automakers. Owner and founder is Cheng Wei, ex Sales Manager of BABA, and Regional Manager of Alipay. In 2014, Cheng hired Jean Liu (Liu Qing), a former Goldman Sachs Asia managing director, as the COO of the company. In February 2015, the company merged with its rival Kuaidi Dache and was renamed Didi Kuaidi (later renamed Didi Chuxing or \u201cDiDi\u201d). In August 2016, DiDi acquired all assets of the Chinese division of Uber. Since the company was founded in 2012, under the leadership of Cheng Wei and Jean Liu, DiDi has grown to become one of the world\u2019s highest valued tech start-ups. By September 2015, Didi Kuaidi had obtained 80% market share in private car hailing services and 99% of the taxis market share. The same month, Didi Kuaidi announced the launch of a rebrand process, including a plan to rename itself \"Didi Chuxing\". 2016: Acquisition of Uber China By the beginning of 2016, Uber China, which started its Chinese operations in 2015, had become a major competitor to Didi Kuaidi. Uber's then-CEO, Travis Kalanick, claimed the company was losing over US$1 billion annually in China. In June 2016, DiDi closed a US$4.5 billion fundraising round, with investors including Apple Inc., China Life Insurance Co., and a financial affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. As part of the round, DiDi secured a $2.5 billion syndicated loan arranged by China Merchants Bank Co. This equity share fundraising round is one of the world's largest by any private company, surpassing the previous record set by DiDi. On 1 August 2016, DiDi announced that it would acquire Uber China in an acquisition valuing Uber China at US$35 billion. As part of the deal, Uber acquired 5.89% of the combined Chinese company with preferred equity interest which at the time equated to a 17.7% economic interest in DiDi. The transaction also provided DiDi with a minority equity interest in Uber. In April 2019, Uber released a public version of its S-1 filing ahead of its planned initial public offering. As part of the filing, Uber revealed that at the time of filing, the company owned a 15.4% stake in DiDi. Uber's stake in the company was diluted (from 17.7% in 2016 to the 2019 stake) as a result of new investments from additional investors since 2016. 2017\u2013present: business expansion, crisis and safety system enhancement In March 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that SoftBank Group Corporation approached DiDi with an offer to invest $6 billion in the company to fund the ride-hailing firm's expansion in self-driving car technologies, with a significant portion of the money to come from SoftBank's then-planned $100 billion Vision Fund. On 28 April 2017, DiDi announced it closed a new financing round of over US$5.5 billion to support its global expansion strategy and continued investments in AI-based technologies. The round valued the company at US$50 billion. In December 2017, Reuters reported that DiDi had raised $4 billion for a global push into foreign markets and investments into technologies such as Artificial Intelligence. In May 2018 the company received a wave of negative media coverage when a female passenger on the company's Hitch social carpooling service was murdered by her driver. In August of the same year, a second female passenger was raped and killed by her driver using the same Hitch service on the DiDi platform. Following these incidents, DiDi suspended its Hitch services in August 2018, and began to reform its platform with improved safety standards. In September 2018, Didi announced an investment of $20 million in customer service, The app's safety updates included an evolving set of safety precautions and in-app functions, including the formation of an in-app safety center, en-route audio recording, police assistance button and blocking function to restrict service from certain drivers and passengers. The company also invested $20 million in its customer service offerings and increased its in-house customer service team to 8,000 staff. As part of the update, DiDi created an online discussion platform to facilitate online and offline national public opinion surveys in China. Media reported that in 2018, DiDi recorded losses of up to $1.61 billion owing to heavy spend on training and recruitment of qualified and skilled drivers. In 2018, the company launched its \"Red Flag Steering Wheel\" program in which verified Communist Party of China members would be visible as drivers. The company also pledged to hire 1,000 Communist Party members as part of its safety drive. In 2018, the company launched a bike and e-bike sharing platform and expanded vertically into auto service sector with the spinoff of Xiaoju Automobile Solutions, a platform providing auto sales, leasing, financing, car maintenance, refueling and recharging services to driver partners on the platform and independent vehicle owners. Since 2015, DiDi has invested in Grab, Lyft, Ola, Uber, 99, Bolt (Taxify) and Careem, and expanded into Latin America, Australia and Japan. In January 2018, DiDi acquired 99, a Brazilian ride hailing app. Services: DiDi serves 550 million users across over 400 cities with products including Taxi, Express, Premier, Luxe, Bus, Designated Driving, Enterprise Solutions, Bike Sharing, E-bike Sharing, Car Rental and sharing, and food delivery. A total of 7.43 billion rides were completed on DiDi's platform in 2017. Some of DiDi's services include: -DiDi Taxi -DiDi Express -DiDi Premier -DiDi Designated Driving -DiDi Enterprise Solution -DiDi Bus -DiDi Luxe -DiDi Bike Sharing -Xiaoju Automobile Solutions -DiDi Financial Services -DiDi Food -DiDi English (In May 2017, DiDi released an English-language service in the Chinese mainland. The service offers English language user interface and a real-time, in-app, instant text message translation to facilitate rider-driver communication) Technology: -Artificial Intelligence (AI) : The DiDi Research Institute is focused on AI technologies including machine learning and computer vision to optimize the platform's dispatch system and route planning services.

{"text": "OK, OK, OK --- I know that Rite Aid had a bad Q4 due to the spike in COVID-19 infections that kept a large portion of the nation on lockdown, the reported weather and logistics issues, and most of all the weak cold and flu season (--Hey, everyone stayed home and wore a mask when out, so no one got sick with the cold or flu). OK, Q4 is now in the rearview mirror, and the stock is trading below $18 per share. Is that price warranted? Some points to consider: 1) The market cap of the stock is now right around one billion dollars. Does that sound reasonable for a company with $24 billion in annual revenue, positive cash flow, and $8 per share in adjusted EBITDA (during a COVID-19 stressed year, no less)? 2) The company provided guidance for the new / current Q1 of their 2022 fiscal year and indicated a break-even result +/- $10 million. This represents a net earnings improvement of $63 to $83 million versus the prior year. 3) RAD management indicated they had administered 2 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first six weeks of the new / current fiscal year. Through the first half of the year, it appears 6 million doses will likely be delivered by Rite Aid. This will result in $210 million in incremental revenue and $2 per share to net earnings. Also, Pfizer's CEO mentioned today (April 15, 2021) that a third booster coronavirus shot will likely be required and that we should expect the COVID-19 vaccine to be administered annually like the flu shot. 4) The short attacks on the stock have ramped up this month leading into the earnings announcement. On March 31, 2021 the short interest was 15.1%. Not the highest we've ever seen, not by a long shot. However, shorts are becoming more agressive in recent days: April 15th - 1,571,592 shares shorted (25.69% short volume ratio) April 14th - 379,924 shares shorted (16.61% short volume ratio) April 13th - 700,706 shares shorted (30.70% short volume ratio) April 12th - 135,778 shares shorted (15.36% short volume ratio) 5) Bartell Drugs acquisition just recently closed. Unlikely to contribute to net earnings during the current fiscal year, but is expected to do so next year. The acquisition makes Rite Aid the pharmacy leader in the Seattle market. 6) Year-to-Date high share price is $32.48 and there are only 55 millioin shares total outstanding. 7) The company has $3.1 billion in debt, which is being adequately managed (---meaning Rite Aid was able to service the debt, buy Bartell drugs, and still maintain positive cash flow last year). For the new / current fiscal year, it appears likely that Rite Aid is positioned to book positive net earnings and cash flow (improving cash flow even further). 8) Break-up value of the company is likely in the range of $40 - $50 per share. Does this sound like a company that should be trading at less than $18 per share with a market cap of just $1 billion? Don't hesitate to pile on with the abuse.

{"text": "Greetings you fools, Wanted to share my due diligence in a company I heavily believe in. DermTech (DMTK) focuses on non-invasive skin disease diagnostics, particularly skin cancer. Current standard for diagnosing skin cancer is to take a surgical lesion biopsy, which is an inherently invasive and unwelcoming process. DermTech has pioneered a new way to test for skin cancer through a non-invasive patch which is 99% accurate. This process cuts the cost of your standard biopsy testing by 25%. No cut needed. I came across this company while looking for undervalued buys in Q4 of 2020 and continue to add because I believe this will become a new adopted standard. DermTech has recently entered into an agreement with Blue Cross Blue Shield in Texas to use their product as an in-network option for melanoma testing. Better yet, they do not require any FDA approval. From the May 2020, S-1 filing- \"We have not obtained regulatory approvals from the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for any of our tests as we operate a clinical laboratory under the CLIA guidelines and believe our tests are laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, that are not currently being regulated by the FDA.\" Now, I\u2019m sick of these short-sellers going after companies with amazing fundamentals, products, and processes. My goal is to predict trends, and I\u2019m confident that genomics will be an industry dominate trend 5-10 years from now, maybe sooner. This company is heavily shorted with a short float of 23.64%, and I honestly couldn\u2019t tell you where the opposition is grounded. My opinion: Genomic medicine will lead us into a world in which we will easily understand what health conditions we are at risk for. Moving from a system in \u2018which we fix you after you are sick\u2019, to one \u2018in which we know what you are going to become sick with and preventing accordingly\u2019, will turn the global medical industry \u201cupside-down.\u201d I've completely YOLO'd my savings on this company, wish me luck, or don't, fuck you.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-04-26 06:31:30", "id": "myfmy1"}

{"text": "MY POSITIONS: I believe in this company long term and think there's a great short term opportunity to buy it below recent price targets. The stock is trading well below its worth because of recent market turmoil and investors not yet grasping Moderna's endpoint. I have a history of buying call options on Moderna when it went on sale. I have over 1,000 shares of Moderna and also have $30k in call options for 4/30. BACKGROUND: I'm a scientist and I work at NYU and the CDC. Back in February 19 2020 before there was a single documented case of COVID in NYC my colleague (Dr. Mark Mulligan) hosted a seminar titled \"2019 Novel Coronavirus - A Pandemic Threat\" -- WHO was still hesitant to call COVID a PHEIC and the CDC was currently making recommendations against wearing masks. Mark shared that Moderna was a promising company and poised to deliver a vaccine for COVID sooner than anyone else and faster than anyone else had ever done in the history of the vaccine world. Mark went on to lead the clinical trials for Pfizer. A little over a year later and I'm fully vaccinated with Moderna. On May 22, 2013 Tesla announced that it paid of its DoE loan 9 years early. It was roughly $19.42, it's now worth 34x as much. Moderna didn't get a DoE loan but they got grant funding and revenue well ahead of their financial plan. They're in a phenomenal position to do three things: 1. Increase production for their current operations 2. Fund additional research in flu vaccines and cancer 3. Pay back debt much earlier than initially projected just like Tesla did A few times in a decade an innovation comes along that makes a great leap forward. Moderna is one of those leaps forward. In 2012 Alex Krizhevsky started the artificial intelligence boom known as deep learning as he advanced an old idea that NYU professor Yann LeCun pioneered in the 90s, the major difference was timing -- both GPUs and data matured in a way where neural networks could flourish. Less than one year later Rob Fergus at NYU reproduced this work, demonstrating one of the most important conditions for growth -- reproducibility. For the vast majority of biotech companies in clinical trials, you're rolling a dice and crossing your fingers. Moderna's approach works, just like neural networks worked -- they will reproduce and mature their technology and apply it to numerous serious diseases and will soon have an expansive portfolio beyond COVID vaccines. Moderna (MRNA) and BioNTech have shown the technology behind MRNA is reproducible and primed to flourish -- MRNA is on a similar trajectory as deep learning. MRNA isn't a new idea nor were neural networks or electric cars, timing is everything. Moderna makes highly effective vaccines for COVID and Flu (soon) that can be developed in a fraction of the time. That's not even the most exciting thing about this company. Moderna and BioNTech may truly treat cancer and not in the way that clickbait articles promise -- but in the way that we used to see HIV as a life threatening disease and now we see it as a treatable and manageable condition. Moderna will benefit from its highly optimized and nimble operations, it's running at a pace that other companies will struggle to catch up with. While BioNTech has talented scientists they needed Pfizer to hold their hands, Moderna (MRNA) has proven far more self-sufficient in navigating the world of business. AZN, NVAX, J&J -> have proven to be poorer choices. They're slower to deliver, they overpromised and underdelivered (J&J), they're less efficacious and more dangerous (AZN). Meanwhile Moderna is scaling up operations to deliver more than projected. Near term catalysts: 4/14: vaccine day, 4/28: annual shareholder meeting Long term catalysts: Curing some types of cancer \\~2023 Longer term catalysts: Making highly tailored personalized medicine to treat once life-threatening diseases \\~2030 TLDR: Moderna is a game changer with room to grow.

{"text": "Here's a short DD on why I think TWST is the best pick going for both short and long term returns: \u200b 1. Genomics stocks are volatile, but with potential for huge returns. One way of getting exposure is by buying companies developing the actual medicines (think CRSP, EDIT, NTLA). These are a bit of a lottery tho as you don't really know if they will pass clinical trials. TWST on the other hand, manufactures DNA to be used in the types of aforementioned companies' research. Therefore, by owning TWST you can get exposure to the industry without being exposed to one company or another having a successful or not clinical trial for a certain medicine. 2. 64% revenue growth over the first quarter of 2020 was reported earlier this year, but the stock go caught up in the massive sell off for all high risk tech stocks. The stock peaked at over $200 earlier this year, and now being at \\~140 provides a chance for some great short term upside. As we are seeing in today's market, when confidence comes back to the market the big caps are first to benefit, followed by the small/mid caps. TWST is perfectly positioned for this next small/mid cap move. 3. Longer term, the stock is even more exciting. They are working with Microsoft (and Illumina (ILMN)) as the founding members of a working group to define the future of data storage using DNA. Give it 10 years, and we will be seeing this method used for data storage. And long before then, once the first signs of progress are seen the hype will be too much for stocks to handle. That last part could happen far before anyone can predict... There are loads of other reasons this company provides the lowest risk high risk investment you will ever find, but I won't bore you.

VIAC priced an offering at $85 per share, the institutions/hedge-funds who bought at those levels have no choice but to reduce their cost basis at current levels. The forced liquidation of Archegos Capital lead to massive VIAC blocks being sold in the market at a discounted price, which aided to the nasty continuous sell-off. There\u2019s been a drastic decline in volume the past few days which signals that the liquidation phase is near or at its end.

{"text": "This is a summary of everything you need to know about NNDM that also includes DD. I wrote the first half of this DD a few months ago and decided to wait until next earnings for more updated information. The most recent earnings was a green light for me. FUNDAMENTALS: CEO Yaov Stern stated that they now have $990 Million of cash reserves (2/2/2021). This will allow NNDM to recover quickly from the halt in sales and is a primer for the huge growth stage that they are going to experience in the coming year and beyond. NNDM is also using the cash reserves for a huge acceleration in R&D, and also for acquisitions of new technologies that they plan on incorporating into new Dragonfly models. Stern says they are looking at 3 or 4 Israeli companies, 3 or 4 European countries, and 4 or 5 US companies (3/11/21). He also mentions that the drastic increase of SPACs in the United States causes many companies to be overvalued. Which as far as I can tell, means he wants to acquire the companies before they go public (in the US at least). In regard to those SPACs: \u201cI\u2019m very careful of being pulled into this rat race of paying too much. It\u2019s a rat race. Even if you win you\u2019re still a rat.\u201d One goal with NNDM\u2019s heavy investment in R&D is to improve machine consistency and support ink types other than silver, which can be expensive. They have been gaining progress on this front but I would still consider it one of their current challenges. REVENUE AND SALES: Determining an actual target price seems to be impossible due to negative EPS. However NNDM is in an early stage of commercial production with a razor & blade model, so this is acceptable for now. The growth during this stage has also stagnated due to COVID-19, and despite 2020 revenue being half that of 2019, it\u2019s still quite surprising because of the incredibly low sales volume from 2020 during the pandemic. Which means customers are indeed using consumables for the Dragonfly, and the razor/razorblade business model is proving to be quite effective. Stern also notes that as of 3/11, 70% of their customers have upgraded to the newest generation of the Dragonfly (compared to the prior version that came out in 2018). Stern is also confident that with all the new applications coming in that are military and industrial spec, once the materials are available post Covid, revenue will skyrocket. All of this along with the business model proving to be at the very least acceptable, if not incredibly effective, seems promising. (3/11/21) 4 levels of revenue: 1. Dragonfly Sales 2. Consumables (Only NNDM can offer the ink, hence Razor & Blade model) 3. Selling maintenance contracts annually (After 1-year warranty) 4. The newly implemented NaNos (Nano Services), which according to Stern is quickly growing NEW PRODUCTS: As mentioned, NNDM is now offering Nano Services (NaNos). Those who don\u2019t buy the machine because they are waiting for the budget to be released can use the software to prototype their products, and NNDM will print it for them using in house machines, to which those companies will only pay per round of prototyping rather than paying for a whole machine which they currently cannot afford. These customers stay in contact with NNDM and by the time we\u2019re out of Covid and those customers have a more flexible budget, they will already be familiar with the software and it will have a slingshot effect on future sales. NNDM is also planning to release the new generation of the dragonfly in mid-2021, which is currently in the middle of alpha stage development. They\u2019re hoping to release it mid 2021 or once the pandemic is officially over. \u201cThe machines we have now are for prototyping and proof of concept. The new system is going to be getting into early stages of production. Even existing machines are currently being used in the production stage by some customers, specifically in defense.\u201d The new machines provide a heighted Z-axis, which allows for multilayered circuit cubes rather than one giant sheet of circuits. \"This is the only technology in the world that can take a digital file and 3D-print a high-performance electronic part.\" That is, a 3D printed circuit board with upwards of 20 or 30 layers. (Each layer being a micro and a half). Normal circuit boards can become incredibly expensive the more layers they have. Whereas a 3D printer doesn\u2019t charge you extra for multiple layers because it doesn\u2019t know if you\u2019re printing 2 layers or 30 layers, it just needs the material. In addition: \u201cOur machine, unlike the standard PCB industry that\u2019s full of non-reusable materials, is going to be environmentally friendly\u201d (reusable ink cartridges). ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS: \u201cI also think it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that Nano could make printers that can create other computer parts given that it appears to have successfully created a 3D printer that can manufacture PCBs. Eventually, it\u2019s possible that Nano could make 3D printers that could make semiconductors themselves.\" \"In a world that\u2019s suffering from a shortage of semiconductors, I have to believe that such a product would generate widespread demand. Given the Internet of Things trend, not to mention the recent strength of PC sales, there should be strong demand for Nano\u2019s current printers that can already, according to the firm, make many computer parts.\u201d About mid-way in the call, Stern was asked if NNDM might expand its market / business model. His answer was very interesting. He said that their mainstay business was 3D printing of electrical components for the high-end market (sophisticated and very small components) - but that they also are looking a nano-scale mechanical component printing - so not just the printing of parts with electrical components, but also moving components. ( I could see this as being a profound application in insertable medical devices and in military / civilian applications that require precise moving parts in an exceptionally small space). \"He also clarified what many people here frequently misrepresent - microprocessors. NNDM can produce multilayer boards upon which many other components are stacked - such as microprocessors, capacitors, resistors, etc - so Dragonflies are very useful for designing and producing very complicated PCBs which can be the base upon which many other electronic components can be attached / stacked.\" When describing the next generation Dragonfly that's coming this summer, Stern said that the company had greatly improved the software design by making it far more user-friendly, especially for complicated component designs. \"He also said that the new printers will have the ability to add components. (I frankly did not fully understand this point, but my best guess is that it means that while a Dragonfly is printing a PCB, it would have the mechanical ability to add / insert a previously made component such as a resistor). I see that as being the first step to a \"lights out\" manufacturing process - where the human walks away from the machine and it produces not only a PCB, but also has added other subcomponents onto the board as it was printed, obviating the need for follow-on steps where a human or robot attaches components to the circuit board.\u201d POSSIBLE CONCERNS: Concern 1: \u201cIn the 12 months that ended in September 2020, Nano\u2019s top line came in at just $3.4 million. In 2019, it reported sales of $7.07 million. Those low numbers indicate that its printers have yet to achieve widespread industry acceptance.\u201d My opinion: 1, The low sales from 2020 is primarily from the halt in demand due COVID according to Stern. And 2, the Dragonfly LDM was a very new product in 2019, so it didn\u2019t really have time to gain an industry wide acceptance. In addition, these are all still very early models of what they hope to turn the Dragonfly into, as Stern explains in the 3/11 earnings interview. Just selling these early models was never the goal, and their heavy investment in R&D supports this. Along with Stern's ultimate goal for the Dragonfly being production level manufacturing (Current generation is meant for prototyping and proof of concept. The next generation will start getting into first rounds of production). Concern 2: \u201cAlthough the company in December reported that some U.S. government agencies and European research and electronic manufacturing organizations had upgraded their Dragonfly printers, it did not identify any of these customers by name. It also did not disclose the revenue it had obtained from the deals. Those omissions make it hard to judge the extent to which the deals validate the company\u2019s technology, let alone whether they\u2019re a case for buying NNDM stock now.\u201d My opinion: I do see how this could be a concern. However I would also understand if the government wanted to keep their contracts under the radar for \u201cundisclosed reasons\u201d or something like that. I also don\u2019t think that those contracts by themselves are a case to buy the stock. But rather the unique product they\u2019re offering, their plan for future growth, and the value acquisition strategy accompanied with accelerated R&D to maintain their current competitive advantage (Even though no other companies can directly compete with this product yet). If they start to take on a lot more debt for no reason and use the cash for that instead of acquisitions and R&D like they said they would, it may be a concern (that would be reflected on their balance sheet anyway). Concern 3: One concern I might have personally is if another company is able to provide the consumables that the Dragonfly needs. Since sales have been lackluster in the past (though they might pick up), NNDM seems to currently rely on the blade portion of their razor/blade model, even though level 1 revenue comes from Dragonfly sales (the razor). Only time will tell if these machines are actually as good as Stern says, but from what I can tell, they are. Although I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s even possible for another company to make a cheaper ink that can be used in the same machine, especially with all of NNDM's patents, but I don\u2019t understand enough about the patents to determine that. Regardless, I see NNDM as slightly risky (in the event sales don't pick up by EOY 2022) but still and incredibly valuable play, especially over the long term. (Anything under 10$ is an absurd deal, even under 15$ in my opinion) TLDR: The Dragonfly gives Nano Dimension a competitive advantage via product differentiation in the industry of additive manufacturing and PCBs, while also breaking into a new market with the same product. Additionally giving them a first mover advantage. On top of all that, their current ratio is an absurd 101.13 (Yahoo). Which seems like REALLY solid support for defending those advantages. Nano Dimension is first-to-market with a unique product that disrupts multiple industries, and are trying to keep it that way.

The discussion comes from a user who sends me 2 links, respectively Black Rock Fund Advisor [ Black Rock Inc [ \u200b I answered pragmatically indicating 2 links of response (I know I was wrong to paste only 2 links without explaining why but I thought that those who understood my post, would understand immediately) Black Rock Fund Advisors [ \u200b Black Rock Inc [ \u200b Well now let's read the comment that disputes my thread: \u200b 1 - \"You directly linked to a position of BR-FA ownership in GME, and now it is useless? Come on dude, do better\" The reason I pasted the 2 links, as a response to the post was to show that there are no updated positions as of 3/31/2021 from Black Rock Fund Advisors. There are no updates since 2017! \u200b 2- \"That 13F-HR is the most recent holdings report. Can you show me where BR-FA sold?\" This is where it gets interesting. You can see that just after that date of the most recent 13F-HR (Filed 2017-02-10), Black Rock Fund Advisors has not submitted any more 13F-HR forms to note their positions. You can check it out for yourself: [ In lieu of submitting the 13F-HR, Black Rock Fund Advisor has begun submitting a 13F-NT form. What's different? Just open the Form to find out: [ \u200b You can tell right away what is written there: 13F NOTICE. (Check here if no holdings reported are in this report, and all holdings are reported by other reporting manager(s).) and List of Other Managers Reporting for this Manager: If there are no entries in this list, omit this section. Form 13F File Number Name 028-12019 BlackRock Inc. \u200b Look who is taking all the trouble to post the positions of their subsidiaries, but it is BLACK ROCK INC!!!!!!! With this 13F- NT Black Rock Fund Advisor is basically saying: from today on, my daddy Black Rock Inc will take charge of everything I have! From here on Black Rock Fund Advisor presented only 13F-NT form (and bought only 4-5 stocks to date). But let's see what was happening to Black Rock Inc in the meantime.... These are the positions of BlackRock Inc on 2017-02-10 taken from 13F-HR: \u200b Source: [ What do you notice? Black Rock Inc had very few GME shares. \u200b But let's analyze the next 13F-HR submitted by Black Rock Inc on 2017-05-12: \u200b Soruce: [ But it's magic!!!! Black Rock Inc owns as many as 14 positions!!! But how is that possible!!!! Oh my god!!! Burn the witch!!!!

The author of the post is simply wrong because: \u200b 1 - There is no reference whatsoever to a transfer of shares 2- But let's say for sure that the author is right, where is the new SEC filing? Why on bloomberg terminal has disappeared fidelity from January 29 onwards? \u200b 3- If there had been a real transfer there would be SEC filings with different C I K's 4- For those who want to believe the fairy tale of the transfer of ownership through ITEM 7 I just say go check out the other 13Gs EXAMPLE: [ [ I took 2 at random, they all have the fucking wording : \" Item 7. Identification and Classification of the Subsidiary Which Acquired the Security Being Reported on By the Parent Holding Company. \" and \"Exhibit A Pursuant to the instructions in Item 7 of Schedule 13G, the following table lists the identity and Item 3 classification, if applicable, of each relevant entity that beneficially owns shares of the security class being reported on this Schedule 13G.\" Opening every 13G there is this wording, following the reasoning Fidelity likes to pass shares in every fucking 13G xD. \u200b I would like to add that after reading what I have written here, it should be clearer why Fidelity has SOLD and not moved shares. \u200b I want to conclude by saying that after posting my GME counter DD, I received many positive comments that understood what I was talking about but also many others that did not understand. It's okay to not understand some things, I didn't understand them when I started either. But I get annoyed by those who try to counter what I have written with really meaningless arguments that only show that they have not understood anything about the subject and have little knowledge on the subject. This is why I sometimes respond badly. \u200b \u200b EDIT: since so many people ask for it here is a TLDR TLDR: Fidelity does not own any GME stock, all the positions you see on the finra site ie: Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC, FMR Inc and Fidelity Management and Research Company are an error. Fidelity sold in January. Instead the position of Black Rock Inc which owns 9,217,335 is confirmed. The other Black Rock Fund Advisors which owns 10m shares is wrong. \u200b TLDR's TLDR: The finra data are completely wrong and are not to be taken into account", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-04-15 10:01:38", "id": "mr29pc"}
{"text": "Hello fellow Apes, GME is a great play and we must hold, but something else very interesting has happened in the market in the past week. The Hedge fund Archegos got blown up when VIAC did an offering at 85 a share and the stock took a hit. They were leveraged 20x over according to some sources. When this happened Goldman Sachs Group Inc. liquidated $10.5 billion worth of stocks of VIAC on their behalf, causing the stock to plummet taking out a ton of stop losses on the way down. This stock is solid it has a great balance sheet and just made 3 billion more cash on an offering that they could by back for 1.5 billion a few days later due to the hedge fund getting blown out of the water. Nothing fundamental has changed with the value of this stonk it is an amazing value right now. Take a look at what has happened with another one of their holdings DISCB climbing like crazy now after the dip.

{"text": "My medium-term bull case for MVIS. \u200b TLDR: Buy MVIS shares, sell way OTM monthly covered calls for absurd premiums. \u200b Disclaimer - I wrote this Sunday night after I decided on my course of action. I did not post until now because I wanted to actually do the trades before posting the DD. The numbers herein reflect prices at that time and they have since changed slightly. \u200b I'm fucking new at this. I got in with GME, I admit it. I'm probably completely fucked on this thesis, and I encourage you all to shit all over it so that I don't lose all my tendies on some batshit weed-induced fantasy. I don't know what I'm doing, and if you follow me you're literally retarded. That being said... \u200b I yolo'd my entire net worth on MVIS today. I'm poor, so this was only 500 shares, but fuck you. We all start somewhere. I just started late... and waited some more. And then missed the bus. \u200b Positions: 3 GME @ 238 500 MVIS @ 11.49 avg \\-5 MVIS 521 18c (0.70 premium realized) \u200b The most important factor in my thesis is the high IV of MVIS. Looking back at the last year, the IV and HV have been consistently high, which given the incredibly swingy nature of this WSB stock is not unexpected. \u200b In my research, which was probably half-assed and woefully inadequate, a high IV is a stock with above 60% or so, and the top few are above 100. MVIS is at 160%. Historically for the last year, this is not abnormal for MVIS. GME is also around 160% right now. \u200b High IV means that the options chain is often very expensive. Lots of people are gambling on this stock moving quickly, so you can sell covered calls for inflated premiums. \u200b Lets do some quick and dirty math. \u200b For our purposes we will use May 21 exp. \u200b GME: current 155. 521 300c is 8.35 (strike = \\~193% current price) MVIS: current 11. 521 20c is 0.80 (strike = \\~182% current price) RKT current 22 521 30c is 0.26 (strike = \\~136% current price) \u200b So, lets look at a metric that probably has a name I don't know: (premium / stock price). This tells me that for every dollar I have invested into a stock, I can earn that amount for the option. This lets me rate options based on what I expect returns to be for selling covered calls. \u200b GME: 5.387% MVIS: 7.273% RKT: 1.182% (IV is \\~60%) \u200b At 7.27% returns on a monthly option, if MVIS were to magically trade sideways and also keep its high IV for a year, you would have nearly doubled your money even if the stock ended the year at the exact same price. \u200b If MVIS drops, it will retain its high IV and you can continue to add shares and sell more monthlies until it rebounds. (Or you can trade the high IV to be much riskier with your pricing until it eventually catches you, hopefully turning a profit in the end - you're a paper handed bitch too) \u200b If MVIS spikes, you have a lot of opportunity to cash in because you are holding shares. Sure you could have \\bought\\ calls instead of selling them, but I want to sell the lottery tickets not buy them. \u200b MVIS is currently dirt cheap at $11, and has been red all month. I think it's close to its bottom and is about to pop right back up a few bucks. \u200b \u200b \u200b Ok, so let's talk potential gains and losses. \u200b Because my position is shares, my losses are fairly limited as I believe based on absolutely no evidence except a couple charts I saw once that there is a fairly hard floor of about $7 that it'll just never drop past again ever. Therefore my maximum loss is maybe $5/share. If I can get 0.80 premiums every month, then in six months I've basically covered my loss and can exit a slightly wiser ape. Or double down and keep selling the IV (This. I'll do this. It's just a dip. Buy more!) \u200b If the stock trades sideways for months and sheds its IV, then I continue to sell calls until I think I can get higher gains elsewhere, and I exit the position with less profit than I had hoped, but no losses. \u200b If the stock spikes but does not pass my strike, I roll the options out (and possibly up) and try to capitalize on the short term spike in IV and premiums. I keep holding until either the IV or stock price drops below levels I am happy with. \u200b If the stock spikes past my strike (currently $18) then I am assigned and exit the trade +$3,250 plus any premiums I got. \u200b In summary: I don't care if this stock moons, plunges, or charts a path like the fucking Evergiven as long as its IV stays high. I'm just gonna build my position and sell lotto tickets to people even dumber than me. \u200b I'm pretty confident in this, so I'm probably fucked. Please teach me. If you want charts and graphs, fuck you do your own DD. If you want rocket emojis, this thread is accepting donations. \u200b Edited to show actual #s reflective of my trading today.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-04-20 05:41:00", "id": "mu7dep"}

{"text": "\u200b Hi, dear wsbros, This is my first WSB post, and I wanted to share my analysis regarding every man\u2019s best friend, Viatris. You know, that company makes that erection pill. Viatris is a roll-off/merge of Pfizer and Mylan. I owned this stock since day one because I have been holding PFE since the pandemic (a pretty lucky bet, nobody knew they would develop the best vaccine at that time). I was legit like, \u201cHey, get-hard pill, I guess I will hold it so I can buy them pills with the dividends,\u201d but since the last crash in late February (around 28%), I have been paying extra attention. I\u2019ve put my eyes on it since then, and I think right now is a great time to purchase with very low risk. # Fundamentals All my friends call me a boomer for a reason; I always look at the fundamentals first (Warren Buffet is my daddy). I am sure you guys have your way to do more research, so I will provide a guideline to stimulate your ape brain. \u200b PFE has created VTRS for a very clear purpose: a total package from Pfizer\u2019s already-lost-exclusivity drugs. Therefore, it\u2019s not supposed to be a growth stock but rather a cash cow waiting to be milked till its death. PFE\u2019s current dividend yield is 4.04%, and it\u2019s not hard to expect that VTRS will have a similar dividend yield once it settles down all the aftermath of M&A and operation optimization. It is expected to generate dividends as early as mid-2022. Buying VTRS now is like buying Coca-Cola 30 years ago (yes, again, Warren Buffet is my daddy). And every man eventually needs a little bit of help. The current valuation is extremely undervalued. You should be able to read it yourself from your favorite website. Several KPIs Estimated P/E: 3.74 (the industry average is 53.13) Gross Margin: 57.87% (the industry average is 38.83%) Total Debt/Equity: 109.13% (the industry average is 148.33%) So again, it\u2019s undervalued, high quality, financially healthy, but not much growth potential. It\u2019s criminally undervalued, and it\u2019s fair to say that this can be your 401k/piggy bank when you retire (if you ever want to, or capitalism still stands). # Technicals It went above the previous support level ($13.32) today (currently priced at $13.36). It crossed above the 20 SMA during the day. RSI went below 30 10 days ago, but now it\u2019s above 40. It has been oversold, according to RSI, basically since late February. \u200b # Cost Because of its recent oversold rally, it\u2019s very cheap to make ITM calls. I made a LEAPS call today. I paid $3.60 for VTRS $10 17 DEC 21 Call 100. Therefore, my IV is less than 27%, with a Delta of .9260 and a Theta of -.0010. It was an unreal experience. I purchased the LEAPS calls (10 contracts), and I made around 20% within 7 minutes. Today, I ended up making 26.39% with $950. # Conclusion I am a very conservative investor. I only allocated less than 10% of the portfolio into the VTRS calls and also owned the stock. In the world of meme stock and growth stocks, we sometimes overlook the more conservative picks; but who cares, right? It makes us them tendies. I am planning to purchase next week once I liquidate some of my assets. Thank you for reading! I will try my best to answer any questions if you guys are interested. # Edit Update (4/23/2021) Hi folks, I wrote this post half asleep last night, and I did not expect to get this much response for my very first post. I really appreciate it except you ape trolls but still love ya. I got several similar questions, so I am going to write a quick summary: I do own a significant amount of shares of VTRS. I\u2019ve had PFE since a year ago (I bought PFE only because I thought it was better than buying a treasury note lol. Nobody knew PFE would develop the Covid vaccine back then!). Therefore, I actually have owned VTRS since its birth. I have been slowly buying up more and more VTRS over time. According to my WeBull, around 14% of my portfolio is in VTRS. I am very long in this stock for a very clear cash generating purpose. The reason why I bought this LEAPS call is because the moment hit the bottom and cost was very cheap to purchase the LEAPS call. IV of 27%, Delta of .9260... you get the idea. * VERY IMPORTANT: the spin-off completed in November 16th, 2020. This should be the start date for you to looking into all fundamental and technical information. If you do this, you may understand my perspective a bit better. This is basically my very first reddit post, and I apologize if my post was not up to your standard. I will try to do better! If anyone is interested, I can probably make an update every month regarding my VTRS position. Thank you!

{"text": "\u200b . This time I was looking at the GME Chart and I noticed something very interesting. \\- Currently we are breaking out of a descending triangle to the upside and the price target for that is 348$ \\- I then noticed if we hit the price target of 348$ we are creating a W pattern which has a higher high base. The realistic price target of the W pattern would be 476$ but a 560$ could happen as well! \\- Currently volume overall in MA deviation rate, MACD and the volume bars is very low and stable which indicates a rise in Volume and Volatility soon.

{"text": "It's a long ass DD, but bear with it, it's worth it. Before I read it I saw DISC-A as a cancerous stock not to be touched with a 6m stick, but I will now be adding it to my portfolio. . \u200b Back in 2012, just after Facebook IPO, a significant concern emerged among investors. Consumers were increasingly using their mobile devices to access Facebook. Since the screen sizes of mobile devices were small, investors were worried about the monetization potential of Facebook's mobile users. As a result, the stock dipped to below $20 from the highs of $40 plus just after its IPO. Mark Zuckerberg noted that users are spending more time while accessing Facebook on Mobile versus desktop and it should benefit Facebook but investors weren't convinced. Facebook introduced News Feed advertising around the same time which coupled with users spending more time on Facebook resulted in better monetization and higher revenues for Facebook. The moral of the story is if you give consumers what they want and how they want it, it will likely lead to them consuming more of your content resulting in better monetization and higher revenues. A similar transition is happening at Discovery with its recently launched Discover plus app. For the last several years Discovery was lacking a good OTT or Direct to Consumer (DTC) offering. Many consumers prefer their digital devices to access content rather than linear television. They also like to access the content library at their will to see what interests them at a particular time and not what is being shown on television at that time. Television viewership is in decline and Discovery not having an attractive product for cord-cutters was a big headwind for the company. This changed with discovery plus launch in January this year. \u200b Higher Domestic ARPUs While it is just initial few days, management noted that consumers are already spending more time when they watch content on the Discovery plus app versus linear television. This coupled with the ability to provide more targeted advertising on mobile bodes well for content monetization in the long term. In its December presentation, management noted that the company generated an ARPU of \\~$7 on linear television in the United States. In the U.S. ARPU on Discovery Plus app is matching linear initially on the ad-free offering with a potential to move higher over the next few years. On the ad lite offering the ARPUs are expected to be higher than linear at the launch with further upside potential as the company is able to deliver more targeted advertising. \u200b Much Higher International ARPUs The swing in the international market is expected to be much higher with pricing on the Discovery plus app being 3x to 4x in many of these markets. Discovery's U.S. Networks generated revenues of $6.9 billion and adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (Adjusted OIBDA) of $4.0 billion during 2020, while its International Networks generated revenues of $3.7 billion and Adjusted OIBDA of just $723 million in the same period. This despite much higher viewership in international markets. For example, Discovery Channel had approximately 86 million subscribers in the U.S. as of December 31, 2020, while Discovery Channel and the Discovery HD Showcase brand had approximately 277 million cumulative subscribers and viewers in international markets. TLC had approximately 85 million subscribers in the U.S. and 5 million subscribers in Canada that are included in the U.S. Networks segment as of December 31, 2020, while TLC content had approximately 356 million cumulative subscribers and viewers in international markets. If the company is able to monetize international subscribers better on the discovery plus app, it can be a game-changer for the company. Initial Discovery plus pricing is a step in the right direction. The company first experimented with the discovery plus app in India last year. India is an example where Discovery's content is very poorly monetized. For linear TV you can get a discovery subscription starting around INR 8.26 per month or \\~$1.32 per annum. The company's heavily discounted annual discovery plus app subscription for one screen is priced at INR 299 per annum or slightly more than $4 per year which is more than 3x linear. The monthly subscription is currently at INR 99 per month or $1.32 per month (which is equal to the annual subscription they charge on linear TV). Still, it has seen 4.5\\ review on Google Play with most of the consumers loving what they are paying for the content and criticism mostly around technical issues like download feature not available, etc. It is not a meaningful market in terms of economics right now but nonetheless, it illustrates what the company is doing to improve monetization in international markets and they clearly are heading in the right direction. So, transitioning from a linear to a digital world is likely to lead to higher ARPUs both in the U.S. and abroad. \u200b Lower Breakeven One thing which differentiates Discovery from other players is its leadership position in non-scripted content which has higher margins. The company's library of high-quality owned content gives it a competitive edge in its niche compared to other OTT platforms. This will enable Discovery plus to break even earlier than most of its peers and have better margins than them. The math here is simple. In FY2020, the company's next-generation revenues were \\~$850 mn and the net impact of next-generation investments (expense minus revenues) was \\~$500 mn. So, the company's expense on the next-generation initiative was \\~$1,350 mn in FY 2020. In Q1 the company's next generation revenues were trending up 50% yoy. If management was using this 50% as the annual revenue growth number (50% of FY2020 revenue (850 mn) = $425 mn incremental revenues in FY2021) while giving guidance for incremental $200 mn to $300 mn in headwinds from next-generation investments, the total incremental expense for next-generation initiatives in FY2021 would likely be in $625 mn (= $425 mn + $200 mn) to $725 mn (= $425 mn + $300 mn) range. If we add it to last year's expense of \\~$1,350 mn, we have total expense attributable to next generation initiatives in $1,975 (= $1350 mn + $625 mn) to $2,075 mn (= $1350 mn + $725 mn) range or $2,025 mn at the midpoint for the current year. If the company is able to get $7 per month in ARPU, the company can breakeven at \\~24 mn subscribers with this cost structure \\. I don't think 24 mn subscribers is that distant a dream given the catalysts like the upcoming Tokyo Olympics and Beijing Winter Olympics, and several new launches scheduled for the back half of this year. My calculation above considers management expectations before Discovery plus got solid traction. It is entirely possible that management decides to invest more to accelerate further the solid traction Discovery plus is gaining. They are managing the next-generation business for long-term growth rather than just breakeven. But I won't be surprised if this business starts contributing $1 bn plus to the bottom-line and free cash flow as subscriber count grows to 40 mn plus over the next couple of years. Management had initially provided OIBDA margin guidance of discovery plus as at least 20%. However, on its last earnings call and a Deutsche Bank conference in March, CFO indicated that there was a lot of conservatism build in that number. I believe discovery plus can easily see an OIBDA margin in the 30% to 40% range as it scales over the next couple of years. \u200b Low Valuation Before Discovery plus launch analysts and investors were characterizing Discovery as a company in secular decline with linear Television subscribers cutting cords and moving to OTT platforms. They were skeptical of the company's ability to attract subscribers on its DTC platform and were questioning whether customers will pay for Discovery's content versus the already existing players like Netflix. The successful launch of Discovery plus has proved the bear thesis wrong. The company gained \\~7 mn new DTC paid subscribers in January and February. While the skeptics may continue to question whether consumers will use online streaming apps other than Netflix, consumers have already spoken - they are using multiple apps. Netflix's net new users' count fell significantly short of analysts' estimates last quarter while other players gained traction. I believe Netflix is a good company with a significant potential to increase its ARPU, but there is no denying that there will be other providers which will co-exist. This is the same as multiple content providers on linear television. Skeptics are ignoring Discovery's leadership position in non-scripted content which has higher margins. With Discovery plus, the company has the potential to significantly grow its revenue and profitability in the short, medium, and long term. So, the company deserves a much better valuation. The company has generated \\~$3.1 bn in annual free cash flow in FY2019. If we exclude \\~$300 mn of net investments (expense - revenues) in new DTC investments, free cash flow from the legacy linear business was \\~$3.4 bn. Last year, due to Covid-19 related headwinds and \\~$500 mn in DTC investments, the company posted \\~$2.3 bn in free cash flow. Excluding DTC investments, the free cash flow from the legacy business was \\~$2.8 bn. I believe in a normalized environment, it is a reasonable assumption that the company's linear business can generate free cash flow over $3 bn. While this year the company's FCF is likely to be impacted by further investment in DTC given the strong traction discovery plus is gaining, I expect FCF to grow substantially above $3bn in the medium term as it sees better monetization and margins from Discovery plus. The company's current market cap is less than $16 bn or \\~5x its legacy linear business free cash flows. This implies investors are expecting the company's business to continue declining and it is failing completely in its DTC strategy. It makes no sense as the company is doing well in terms of its DTC performance. I believe the company can easily reach $4 bn to $5 bn in free cash flow over the next few years with the pivot to DTC at higher ARPUs adding a billion or two to legacy linear business FCF. If we assign a P/FCF multiple of 10x, the market cap should reach $40 bn to $50 bn versus currently less than $16 bn. So, there is a potential for its stock to triple from the current levels. Class wise Discovery A shares and C shares are certainly cheap. I am preferring A shares as I am exploring the potential of \"retail activism\" (discussed in the next section) and A shares have voting rights while C shares don't. B shares carry much higher voting rights but are trading at a significant premium. If Discovery plus continues to gain traction, I believe even B shares can go higher but the risk-reward scenario appears much more favorable for A shares. I don't like to sound like promoting Bill Hwang's bull thesis here but frankly, I believe there is no bear thesis for short selling at this price other than scaring smaller investors. \u200b High Short-Float By now everyone knows about Archegos implosion and how it impacted Viacom and Discovery's stock where the fund had a disproportionately large stake. However, there is more to the story. In addition to Archegos fallout, one of the reasons behind the recent correction in Discovery's share price is heavy shorting by short-sellers post-Archegos fallout. The number of shares short for Discovery class A increased 13.43 mn from February 25th to March 30th. As of March 30th 58.98 million of Discovery class A shares were short representing 42.59% of the float. In the same period, 17.84 mn shares of Discovery C class were sold short. A similar attempt to short Discovery B class shares resulted in a short squeeze due to low float. Given the initial success of Discovery plus, I don't think there is a fundamental case to short Discovery at these levels. However, we have started seeing articles in media which are trying to portray the company in a negative light. There have also been selective leaks in media which have led to panic among small investors and caused a sharp drop. This seems to be the routine playbook of shorts to scare retail investors. I believe Discovery A shares can be a good potential target given the high short interest, low valuations, strong cash flow generation profile, and somewhat of a hubris among short-sellers that it is ok to short a company that has incredibly good free cash flows and is successfully pivoting to DTC business which has higher growth potential and better ARPUs. Discovery has an offering that most of the investors themselves use and understand. There is a significant risk to short-sellers if smaller investors chose not to panic and hold the stock as the company executes its DTC strategy. . .

Also, I don't care about how many micro-brews you have in your town. Beer is somewhat irrelevant to this play. Molson-Coors is no longer the piss beer coors brand that your drunk uncle remembers. It\u2019s now a company that\u2019s woken up from the dead with new leadership and rollout of fantastic products. They have focused on a completely new product lineup, that involves seltzers, energy drinks, THC beverage\u2019s, and a \"beyond beer\" segment. Couple all these new products with the lockdowns ending globally and you are going to have a monster Q2/Q3 earnings report. Not to mention this stock is beat down so much from wall street it\u2019s a asymmetric trade as it stands right now. First off, wall street fucking hates this company and for good reason. The past 7 years they were stagnant and failed to adapt to new markets/trends. They took on billions of debt to purchase SABmiller. Another shit beer company that wasn\u2019t doing shit. The beauty of this is that wall street is frozen and is going to be late to the party when they get smacked in the dick with earnings for Q2 and Q3 of this year. They have a wait and see attitude to towards this company and they will be forced to pile on once they see the results from the new products molson-coors has deployed. To name a few: Topo Chico Hard Seltzer: Owned by coke but Molson- coors has exclusive manufacturing, distribution and marketing rights. This new seltzer is the hotness on the streets right now. It had a soft launch 3 weeks ago in 9 states and it already has over 3% of the seltzer market. Go out and pick some up(if its not sold out everywhere) and I promise you you\u2019ll be throwing your life savings into this company on Monday morning. Zoa: New energy drink from the Rock. Who knows how this is going to sell but with the Rock pushing this to his tens of millions of social media followers, im sure it\u2019ll do just fine. I've spoken to a health store(cant name it here because of the automods) rep who have said this is selling as well as redbull and monster. Light Sky: One of the best if not best light beers out there. Its blue moons light offering. Go check it out, it\u2019s a crushable summer beer. Perhaps the best light beer on the market right now. Yuengling: Signed distribution rights to expand the company to the West Coast. Vizzy Hard Seltzer: Another new solid seltzer offering. Has vitamin-c and shit that all the crunchies like. Also has great taste and flavors. Coors Seltzer: Not sure who buys this but I heard its selling really well. Just glad the company has many different seltzer offerings now. Truss Beverage: THC infused beverage offering that\u2019s killing it in Canada and has plans to expand to the US soon. This is going to be the market leader in the THC industry. It it universally the favorite in Canada. Beyond beer hub For a hard coffee drink, he raved about the sampler packs they got, and extremely good initial response from that, rolling that out soon but didn\u2019t know timeline, he\u2019s heard topo is flying, the whole company is buzzing, but didn\u2019t know much beyond that. Said his factory laid 200 people off start of 2020, and have now hired back 350. He was extremely enthusiastic. Overall said in his ten years he\u2019s never seen coors do so well. Very confident in management and direction\u201d. All of these solid new product additions coupled with the US coming out of lockdown and they are going to blow the tits off earnings Q2 and Q3. I expect the earnings call this week to be terrible for Q1 due to lockdowns and a cyber attack that stalled beverage production. Good time to jump in. TLDR: Revitalized company with new leadership, fantastic new diverse product offerings coupled with ending lockdowns will be rocket fuel for this company. Q1 earnings will suck because of the lockdowns and cyber-attack disrupting production but Q2 and Q3 will blow the tits off wallstreet. In my opinion the Q1 report will give us all a solid price to buy in. $SAM 6X in 3 years and I expect similar performance or better here. The stock is so beaten down from the past 5 years it's a safe asymmetric play with incredible upside potential. Even Michael Burry owns this. But he'll probably sell out before it rockets like GameStop because he's a boomer.

{"text": "What\u2019s poppin\u2019 fellas, I\u2019ve got a trade thesis for y\u2019all which I need picked apart. Although I spent a great deal of time discussing it with the greatest minds Twitter and Discord had to offer, I still can\u2019t shake the feeling that this trade is pretty fuckin\u2019 stupid at face value, so bare with me. I was a little drunk on Easter, and had an epiphany : - SPY 100 - 200 took roughly 14 years. - SPY 200 - 300 took 3.5 years. - SPY 300 - 400 took a little over a year. With the rate things are going, SPY 400 - 500 is looking like it\u2019s set to happen in under a year, maybe even faster. Hell, in our current investing environment, I would be shocked to see SPY lower than 500 by the end of the year. Asset inflation is running rampant which is indirectly driving up the value of equities, we\u2019re printing fuckloads of money with no end in sight, and money is flowing into the markets out the ass as investing becomes increasingly mainstream. I know a lot of people will doubt me for these things, but I\u2019m thoroughly convinced that this is what modern day inflation looks like. /u/DustyBowls had an awesome writeup on this which can be found below : --- The stock market is not a bubble. This is inflation. This is what modern inflation looks like. The federal government - Dem or Repub matters little, as Bush, Obama, Trump and now Biden all did this - they hide the true inflation by excluding things from the inflation basket such as real estate. All the easy money, low interest rates and supermassive spending by Bernanke, Yellen, now JPow. This is why the upper middle class and to a much greater extent the rich can profit at all times - they're so heavily into stocks and other financial devices plus housing and land that the massive devaluation of the dollar and the explosion in inflation is not their problem - they just rise with the tide. Regular middle class and worker bees (the 99.6%) are seeing massive pay cuts in the form of inflation. You got a decent job making high five / low six figures and want to buy a place? Even in mid-size midwestern towns, the housing market is so hot that you just got priced out of the market. And you'll never get back into because this is not a bubble that will burst - this is inflation. The Federal government is going to print even more money and devalue the dollar so that its debt / GDP doesn't get too fuked. The rich don't care. The well-positioned middle class (a minority of the middle class) don't care. Everyone else should. You got a $600 or $1400 or $2500 stimulus check? Cool story the housing price and your rent just went up 10% compound for the next five years and you're far worse off than you were. It ain't a bubble it's a rising sea. If you aren't in a yacht or at least a skipper, you're fukin\u2019 drowning man. Your flat salary, your savings account, your hourly wage - you just got a LOT poorer. --- By riding the coattails of the rich, we can look to become a lot less poor in the process. We\u2019ve identified the trend, and now we can also rise with the tide. Ultimately, our end goal seems to be SPY 500. The price action over the past year reinforces this, as we\u2019ve gone from $264 to $405 (over a 55% increase) during that time period. Hell, even the past decade of data supports us. Every year from 2008 onwards, bar 2015 and 2018 have easily netted a 20% return. If we see an increase that\u2019s even remotely as good, we will be well ITM by the time our year is up. SPY 01/21/2022 500Cs are trading for $1.00. Dirt fuckin cheap. For more risk averse traders, we can go with a SPY 450C 01/21/2022 for $5.00 instead. Regardless of the chosen strikes, if these plays hit, it\u2019s at minimum a 10 bagger, likely more. Personally, I\u2019m going to look for an entry around SPY 400 since we\u2019ve left some gnarly gaps, but I\u2019m thoroughly convinced that we may continue to rip. We need less than a 20% increase in 10 months, which is well within reach. We\u2019re in a fucked up investing landscape, which is heavily skewed towards exponential growth. All we need to do is take the leap of faith, and reap the reward in a couple of months. All that being said, I can\u2019t think of a good bear thesis, so this is where I turn to y\u2019all. I\u2019m not worried about the \u201cbubble\u201d popping, as I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a bubble; This entire system is just a byproduct of the insane amounts of money we have printed. In my eyes, the only thing that can stop SPY 500 from happening is us getting nuked by North Korea, a new strain of super aids wiping out a good chunk of civilization, or aliens coming down and fucking some shit up. If any of those things happen however, we\u2019ve got bigger problems than our SPY 500Cs expiring OTM. If anyone has a decent bear thesis, please lay it on me.

{"text": "Not everyone is going to get vaccinated. This will cause problems for society, and opportunities for us. Most of the mainstream media is pushing the vaccine. Whether this is appropriate is irrelevant to the investor; what matters is that critical alternatives/complements to vaccines have been getting little attention. Experts realize that alternatives are needed ASAP. Company just boomed, perhaps because of the above-linked article calling some attention to the nasal spray idea. But having watched Atossa (and lost money on it) for a while now, I've found the CEO to be a bit unfocused - he tweets a lot about how Covid was obviously made in a lab. Whether that's true doesn't matter to me - I just wish he and the company would spend more time focusing on development and less tilting at windmills. Pass. I don't know much about Auris, but I'm staying away from big gambles and microcaps right now. Position: sold 2000 shares of Atossa at a loss in early April. Monoclonal antibody treatment: Care for the unvaccinated, and those who contract Covid anyway, is necessary. I'm bullish on both monoclonal antibody companies. REGN has Emergency Use Authorization (\"EUA\") to administer a combo of casirivimab and imdevimab to reduce hospitalization and emergency room visits. It's a key part of the fight against Covid, and REGN is a solid stock. That said, the EUA has been on the market since November; also, REGN is too expensive for me to play options. Good stock, but pass. Humanigen is my play here. It's been a volatile ticker as it bounces around from good news (high volume big spikes) to no news (low volume melt downwards) around lenzilumab, its Monoclonal antibody. Lenzilumab differs from the REGN cocktail in that it is meant to treat patients once they are already hospitalized. In other words, it's a heavy hitter. Bears point out that the cost of lenzilumab could be extremely high; bulls point out that if it's actually effective, it'll be a hell of a lot cheaper than extended hospital stays. If it receives an EUA, expect a significant pump, and possibly even an acquisition, sometime in the next year. Position: I've been selling and closing CSP's on this to profit from the volatility. Currently, I have CSP's open @ $17.5 strike, exp 5/21. Hoping to get assigned. Oral Vaccine: Vaxart is in position to be first to market with an oral vax. Here are all the companies currently in the race; a few $8 puts expiring next week to hedge. Considering rolling some out tomorrow to enjoy more theta. Looking to convert options to equity if it moons and play this longterm. None of this is financial advice, I am a complete moron who spends most of his time inserting skittles into various orifices. Good luck everyone and stay safe! tl;dr Not everyone will submit to the jab; USA needs a plan to deal with vaccine hesitancy; need pills and oral vaccines; nasal sprays meh. Vaxart \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 with insane options activity.

{"text": "Hello Traders and Investors! An exciting week ahead of us, here is my weekly newsletter which I share every Monday to help prepare you for the week! Feel free to DM me and happy trades! Week of 4/19/21 The S&P500 opened Monday 4/19/21 at 4179.80, just below the previous close of 4185.67 on Friday 4/16/21. Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) prepare to square up over the social media platforms controversial tracking of consumer data. Facebook, which generates a large portion of its profits from targeted advertising, is known to collect consumer data to deliver the ads it believes will be the most successful. Apple has been in the process of developing what it calls \u201cApp Tracking Transparency,\u201d for its devices and announced in January that the feature will be included and enabled by default on all new Apple operating systems. The technology, which was tested publicly in summer of 2020, will prevent applications like Facebook and Instagram from being able to collect user data. Facebook has begun preparations to sue Apple, who is currently in the midst of a lawsuit over App Store payments for the popular online game, Fortnite. Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke on the issue following statements from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg citing Apple as their, \u201cbiggest competitor.\u201d Tim appeared committed to continuing to roll out the technology, saying, \u201cTechnology does not need vast troves of personal data, stitched together across dozens of websites and apps, in order to succeed. Advertising existed and thrived for decades without it. And we\u2019re here today because the path of least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom. If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform.\u201d Apple will hold its first product showcase of the year tomorrow, 4/20/21. The technology frontrunner is suspected to unveil our first glimpses of consumer-grade Augmented Reality technologies. The product showcase comes on the heels of a great month for the emerging AR industry, which was just the subject of a $20 Billion military contract with Microsoft. Apple is up 0.86% on the market open. Emerging fitness company Peloton (PTON) traded down 5% on the open following federal regulators warnings against treadmills sold by the company. The Consumer Product Safety Commission released statements April 17th warning parents of children and pet owners to exercise caution after the death of a child who became wedged underneath the machine. At least 40 incidents of injury related to the machine have been recorded since its release. Reports of Google (GOOG) using foreign tax loopholes to evade taxes have emerged. The company reportedly used the \u201cdouble-Irish,\u201d loophole to funnel over 100 Billion in profits through Ireland and into Bermuda in 2018 & 2019, allowing the company to collect the profits free of U.S. taxation. The loophole was addressed and abolished by the U.K. in 2015, however the nature of the change to legislation still allows companies established before it\u2019s passing to exploit the loophole. A spokeswoman for Google indicated that the loophole is no longer being used by the company, and that the U.S. taxes avoided by using the loophole would have amounted to approximately 80% of all taxes levied against the profits. The September 2020 agreement to merge NVIDIA (NVDA) and ARM Ltd. is currently in limbo as U.K. regulators have released statements intervening in the acquisition. The merger, which was negotiated by NVIDIA and SoftBank, is worth approximately $40 Billion. The intervention was released this morning, 4/19/21, and carries with it the stipulation that a full federal investigation be conducted and completed by the end of July 30th, 2021. The state of the deal is uncertain as markets await a press release from NVIDIA. JP Morgan (JPM) has displayed considerable interest in funding a new professional soccer league in Europe. The European Super League, which was announced on Sunday by a dozen of the world\u2019s largest football clubs, will be established to rival the current European Champions League, and will consist of 12 of Europe\u2019s leading clubs, mostly from Spain and the U.K. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan confirmed in an email that it would be involved in funding the league, but the amount in which JP Morgan will be contributing is still unknown. JP Morgan posted earnings of 12.61 last week and was up 0.5% on the market open. A relatively low amount of major economic numbers will be released this week. Reporting starts with Jobless Claims at 8:30AM on Thursday, April 22nd. Instead expect a busy week for earnings reports, with many major companies reporting earnings throughout the week. Some of the larger players releasing earnings include Coca-Cola, on Monday, Johnson and Johnson on Tuesday, Intel on Thursday, and American Express on Friday.

The high short interest shown was a mistake by Factset and the short% of float is way way lower. Short interest is actually only about 35% of float, which is moderately high but not anywhere remotely close to the 145% being spread around. 1. Institutional shares like Vanguard that are counted in the post are freely tradable and are never deducted from a float calculation. 2. Clover\u2019s publicly traded equity are Class A shares. Clover\u2019s CEO only holds Class B shares. The screenshot shows that FactSet accidentally thought CEO Garipalli\u2019s 83 million Class B shares were Class A shares. They were not, but because of the mistake FactSet subtracted them from the calculation of Class A float, which led to the mistakenly low number. In other words, the screenshot of the \u201cevidence\u201d actually debunks this thesis. There are about 109.8 million shares in the free float, and FactSet, Bloomberg, and Reuters are now all in agreement on that. But when FactSet subtracted 83 million from that by mistake it made it look like the float was only \\~27 million (109.8 - 83) which made it look like the short interest as a % of float was massive.

{"text": "tl;dr: PLUG has a history of burning shareholders and customers, does not make an economical product, and the shares are worth much closer to $0 than to $30. If you're thinking of buying shares or calls, don't. If you hold shares or calls, sell them. If you want to make a bet, buy puts. It's July 2000. You've made a decent amount of tendies over the past few years investing in hot tech companies. The markets are down a fair bit from their March highs, but that just means there are more buying opportunities. Maybe you can find the next Microsoft. You find a stock that looks promising -- Plug Power. It's down 50% from its 52-week high, but you're sure it's gonna be huge. Green energy is the future. It's got the largest company in the world, General Electric, as an investor. Bob Nardelli anyway to try and recoup costs. Soroof (the name of the Saudi trading company, but I'll call them \"the guys who financed 9/11\" for long) further alleges that GEFCS was just an empty shell with \"nominal assets consisting of a small amount of furniture, a telephone switch and a computer server\" and an office subleased from Plug. And GEFCS duly extracted $1 million from the guys who financed 9/11 in exchange for exclusive rights to distribute the fuel cells in Saudi Arabia. Somewhat incredibly, the complaint alleges that Plug and GE then proceeded to jerk around the guys who financed 9/11 for five years, telling Soroof over and over again that they were improving the product and it wasn't quite ready yet but it would be soon. Finally, \"In 2005, Soroof expressed its dissatisfaction with complete lack of performance to date\", which you might recognize as the same thing your wife did right before she introduced you to Chad. The JV had effectively been dead for years (or so Soroof claims), but GE and Plug knew to expect a lawsuit, and hurriedly wound up the operation, with PLUG indemnifying GE against the first $1 million in claims arising from GEFCS. Plug filed an 8-K So if this complaint was filed by the guys who financed 9/11, why should you believe them? Well, there are other signs that the higher-ups at GE knew pretty quickly that Plug's fuel cells weren't going to be commercially viable. GE had agreed to buy fuel cells from Plug in early 1999 -- but they couldn't meet specifications. Then you need to consume more energy to compress and transport the hydrogen. Then you turn it back into water, electricity and waste heat in a fuel cell. It's much cheaper and more efficient to transmit the energy directly over high-voltage power lines! For some applications -- like the forklifts that Plug promotes today -- there is a last-mile problem to solve, but as I'm sure you've heard, battery technology today is very good, and it's just more economical to use battery power. (I'll have more to say about both the physics and the forklifts in follow-on posts.) Through the fiscal years 2001-6, Plug Power produced a cumulative loss of $16 million on $67 million of revenue before any operating expenses. Their net loss was much worse. By early 2007, the stock was trading at about where it is today on a split-adjusted basis, and if you bought in July 2000 you were down 95%. It got cut by another 90% before it rallied last year.

We have made no decisions yet. We are thinking about it, but we haven\u2019t made any decisions yet.

Let me unpack this for you. AMC is saying that if any of the bad things they listed in the statement happen they will not hesitate one moment to issue more shares.. Theater openings delayed? More shares. AMC can\u2019t pay its interest and debt on schedule? More shares. Motion pictures companies don\u2019t want to screen their movies at theaters for months and go to their own digital platform after two weeks? You got it, more shares.

The rest is in for the ride as it\u2019s all pure profit, so naturally I want it to go as high as possible. TLDR: good news the CEO stood by his promise.

{"text": "Here is some DD on HYPRO. I hope to hear your thoughts on this, in my opinion, very bullish company. 1. HYPRO specialises in large-scale hydrogen production (100MW). They are in the midst of demonstrating their new patented technology which takes the efficiency of hydrogen production up to 94% compared to the rest of the hydrogen industry that is lagging behind at 80%. This technology is expected to be ready for the markets in 2022. They will have the best technology in the hydrogen sector. Massive. The EU is funding companies that are able to demonstrate efficient hydrogen production in the scale of 100MW production plants. HYPRO has applied for this funding and decisions concerning the funding will come this June. HYPROs technology will take the dollar price of producing a kilogram of hydrogen to 1,2dollars compared to EUs goal of finding someone who can produce it for 2,5\u20ac/kg of hydrogen. Almost hard to believe.. 2. In Q4 of 2020 HYPRO made an operating profit, which is pretty unheard of in the hydrogen industry. Everyone else is taking losses. 3. HYPRO has no debt. 4. HYPRO just signed a deal with Hynion about supplying hydrogen to 30 hydrogen fueling stations that will be built in Scandinavia in the coming years. Hundreds of trucks delivering goods will be charged in these stations. HYPRO and Hynion in collaboration are the only ones providing hydrogen fueling stations in the near future and will have an advantage on everyone else. 5. HYPRO is in a huge dip and hasn\u00b4t soared 1000% like some other companies like PLUG. 6. They are helping energy giant Repsol to achieve carbon-neutrality by 2050.

{"text": "TL;DR: Trucking will be the first viable business for autonomous vehicles. TuSimple ($TSP) currently has the best autonomous truck tech and is the closest to commercialization. \u200b Why not Robotaxis? Robotaxis are sexier and thus get all the media attention. But commercialization of robotaxis currently poses several technical, operational, and business challenges. \u200b Why not Robotaxis: Technical Robotaxis are most profitable in downtown environments. But those environments also pose the greatest challenges for an autonomous vehicle due to the large number of hard-to-predict agents. No company has been able to solve those yet. \u200b Pick up and drop offs are also technically very challenging because, frankly, most Uber/Lyft pick up and drop offs in downtown environments are in illegal locations. Human drivers can get away with that. But a computer system cannot be programmed to perform illegal actions without the company being held responsible. \u200b Why not Robotaxis: Operational With Uber or Lyft, the drivers do much more than just drive. They purchase, store, clean, fuel/charge, and maintain their vehicles. With robotaxis, all of this operational load falls to the robotaxi company. Where are they going to store thousands of vehicles in downtown environments? How are they going to charge them and perform all of the other operational tasks? Even if this problem could be solved, it means that robotaxis will scale much more slowly than Uber or Lyft did. \u200b Why not Robotaxis: Business The cost of robotaxis is currently extremely high due to the compute and sensor requirements. Even if they perform perfectly, it will take a long time before they are more profitable than vehicles with human drivers. \u200b Further, recent regulation in the US has shown that the public support is behind the drivers, not the silicon valley companies. Driving for Uber and Lyft has been a lifeline to people who lost their jobs during the pandemic. So robotaxis are going to be viewed with hostility and likely backlash from the public and thus from governments. \u200b Why Trucking? Why Trucking: Technical Highway driving, though higher speed, is much more structured than downtown environments. In most ways it is much easier, as evidenced by current level 2 driver assistance systems that easily handle most highway driving. It does, however, require much longer range perception. We will return to that below. \u200b Why Trucking: Operational Trucks already have all of the operational infrastructure. They are stored at depots. They have dedicated staff for their cleaning, maintenance, fueling, etc. Making trucks autonomous can simply leverage all of this infrastructure. \u200b Why Trucking: Business There is currently a shortage of truck drivers. Freight shippers want to ship faster (and not need to wait for drivers to sleep). Truck driving is not a fun or healthy job. It keeps people away from their families. And trucking is a $4T industry globally ($1T in the US). \u200b Given the long lifespan of trucks and their ability to run for millions of miles, the cost of the autonomous compute and sensor system can be amortized much better than for robotaxis. \u200b In short, the stars are all aligned for autonomous trucks today. \u200b Why TuSimple? The players who started with robotaxis have built their entire tech stack around detailed but short range perception. Trying to convert that tech stack to trucking poses more challenges than one might expect. But since TuSimple has focused on trucking from the beginning (2015), they have built their stack to have 1000 meter perception - more than 4x other companies. \u200b TuSimple also has been building up partnerships with the rest of the international freight ecosystem since the beginning. They have key partnerships with OEMs, Tier 1s, shipping companies, and part manufacturers in the US, Europe, and Asia. None of the other autonomous companies have that. \u200b TuSimple is also building their Autonomous Freight Network across the US in multiple phases. Initially, only corridors with favorable weather will be autonomous. But as the technology improves to be able to handle heavy rain and snow, additional corridors can be easily flipped from manual to autonomous mode. \u200b But, but, aren\u2019t they Chinese? They definitely have ties to China. Their first investors were Chinese. So what? \u200b This actually gives them an advantage vs pure US players: they have easy access to the entire trucking market in China. \u200b Conclusion Given all of the above, TuSimple is undervalued with its current valuation of about $8B. Some other self-driving companies are around $30B or more, despite facing all of the challenges mentioned. \u200b In other words: TSP to the moon, apes! \u200b \u200b Sources: [ [ [ [", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-30 04:51:54", "id": "nnsnmx"}

{"text": "$UWMC Due Diligence - Don't knock it til you read it, or don't I'm a reddit post not a cop. By now most of us are familiar with UWMC and its +23% run in the past week. A stock with a massive dividend. A stock trading with a very low P/E of and income growth of 4,200%. So why is this stock still a buy and hold for me right now? The CEO is positioning them to increase shareholder value, but also position the company to weather any reduction in the refi market. (65% of the business) There are major catalysts that have been driving the increase in price that goes beyond the attention gained on WSB. Announced NET earnings of $860M in the first quarter, with huge margins. Reaffirmed a continued dividend, the next ex-dividend date is 6/9/2021. Announced a $300M stock buyback, representing as much as 40% of the free float at the current prices. Russell index inclusion was missed last quarter due to confusion about their PREVIOUS status as a SPAC. It is expected that they will be reconsidered for Russell Index inclusions in the yearly reconstitution. While not the biggest catalyst, this is a sign of reputation and long-term stability for the stock. The prelim list publishes 6/4/2021. Creation of a jumbo mortgage product. The average loan origination in the market is \\~410,000, indicating that the non-conforming section of the mortgage market is exploding. This is a very profitable sector of loan origination. Other fundamentals driving a buy recommendation: Small float. 90M float, of which only about 60M is freely trading. This stock is not persistently pressured down quite as hard as others due to low share availability, but it appears based on the last two weeks it's trading the small waves of this stock to try to push it down under dangerous strike prices. A wave of positive sentiment could strangle this position in the stock. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, but based on the evidence over the last several days, the indication is the 13.1% SI has grown. Exceptional open option interest for tomorrow 5/21/2021. The options expiring tomorrow have been documented elsewhere so I won't belabor them, but the open interest at the $9, and $10 strike represent almost 10% of the free float. Not a new startup, they have been in this business since 1986, making them almost as old as a fossil like me. They clearly survived the 2008 storm. This company isn't going anywhere anytime soon. The cherry: STILL forecasting growth in Q2, whereas many of its competitors are not. This post is NOT financial advice, but as someone who has ridden the waves of this stock since it was about $9, I see this position turning positive and the outlook through July for this position has high sentiment. Even if the mortgage market slows down as expected, I will hold these shares for years to come for the dividends and general stability of the organization. My position 8000 shares @ 7.65 and 45x 6/18 8c. You can go stalk the fuck out of me if you want to see that I've been talking about this stock for some time and been saying the same thing about the strength and targets of their position since March.

{"text": "So first of all, Im not rich. I dont have 100 thousands of dollars. But if you only listen to rich people for advice, then this DD isnt for you. Edit: nice close at 19$ You probably havent heard about The Lion Electric Company - Market Cap 3,5 billion USD What does the Lion do? They do 100% electric trucks and busses. And yes there is a lot of competition in the EV market, but not that much for trucks. Lion doesnt make cars, only trucks. They also already have orders from Amazon and scholar institution. What makes me think LEV is a buy 1. Lion is going to open a manufacturing facility in Illinois worth about $500M. The Illinois government is financing $70M for this. When fully operational, the factory will be able to produce 20,000 vehicles per year. It will be the biggest of its kind in the US. Lion says they plan they start production in mid-2022. It will take time before they even sell half of that each year, so this is very good. 2. Lion is also opening a battery factory in Quebec (Canada). The government is financing 100M CAD (roughly 82M USD) to help them build it. This means that not only Lion will make 100% electric trucks, they will also produce their own batteries which they could potentially sell to other businesses in the future. But most important is that they wont have to buy it from another. 3. Quebec will no longer allow to sell new gasoline vehicles by 2035 (it doesnt concern used cars). This is in 15 years (only? Lol). But a lot of companies already started their transition to 100% EV. And all the state owned business will buy from a Canadian company, because thats how Canada works most of the time. All the school busses and normal busses have to be replaced, and we know they wont buy from a Chinese company when there is a Quebecker one available. So its probably going to be Lion Electric. You should also note that some private companies like Loblaws are already transitioning to EV, they bought a lot of Tesla trucks recently. However, Lion's trucks are not only local but also expected to be cheaper and good quality. 4. Lion has clients Amazon made a contract with Lion to buy 2,500 trucks over 5 years. But theres a downside: Lion is obliged to reserve 500 trucks per year for Amazon, while Amazon isnt obliged to actually buy them. It means that if the trucks quality is deceiptive, its possible Amazon would not buy them. This would of course be horrible for the stock. But Amazon isnt the only big client: First Student bought 260 busses from Lion. It was announced this week, and I can still feel the +30% impact on my portfolio. Everyday LEV went higher than the previous one. 5. LEV has a huge potential for long term profit. I personally think the stock could reach 25USD before the end of the year, but it could be even more. And when the Illinois facility will finally open, the stock should go higher than 30. If you look up the Northern Genesis stock history (the SPAC that merged with Lion 3 weeks ago), you will see the stock was at 30+ in January, but it fell with all the EV market. If you dont buy LEV this year, it might be too late. Of course the stock will be way higher in 5 years than now, but the more profit the better, right? So in my opinion, you will make 100% to 300% within 3-4 years with this stock. But I am not an expert and you dont have to trust me. I trust myself and mostly trust The Lion Electric Company. I am already making small profit from this investment. Have a good day and may your portfolio be green!", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-22 04:54:51", "id": "nhyn43"}

{"text": "TL:DR - Supply and demand fundamentals require the price of uranium to go up or the lights will go out. The nature of the uranium market (security of supply) means that when price-insensitive utilities see prices rising, they get squeezed. This is not priced in, and when this sector runs it has historically provided 20x returns. Background: Nuclear provides 20% of the electricity for the United States and 50% of its clean energy. Greta Thornberry probably gets steamy enough thinking about Uranium to run her own reactor. The market cap of all uranium miners is roughly $20 billion. For reference, with $20 billion you could buy all of the companies that provide fuel for over 50% of the US clean energy and 11% of electricity generated worldwide; or you could buy 1 of the following: 3% of tesla, all of Quantumscape, half of Palantir, 1/5 of Zoom or 1/3 of the market cap of the unsayable barking corn. These could all disappear tomorrow and it wouldn't have too drastic of an impact, but you cant just get rid of 11% of electricity worldwide without drastic consequences. Nuclear isn't going anywhere anytime soon- in fact it looks like it is heating up. China and India are making investments into nuclear (China is building 11 reactors, India 7), the EU is looking to change its taxonomy to include nuclear as 'a certain group' friendly (automod blocks me if i say the word), America (under Trump) recently formed the Nuclear Fuel Working group to build up reserves of Uranium, and Biden looks set to continue the path being the first democrat in 40 years to support nuclear. Carbon neutral cant happen without nuclear - solar and wind have Capacity Factors of roughly 20-30% while nuclear has a 90% CF. It is beginning to show with many countries extending the licenses to operate of nuclear plants by 20-30 years. Sleepy's green new plan talks about \"advanced reactors\", likely Small Modular Reactors (SMR's) that could be very standardized, reducing the risk of problems. (for educational purposes: nuclear reactors don't explode, they operate with high pressure/temperature water that creates hydrogen via hydrolysis which can create a Hindenburg-like explosion. The Uranium is 3-5% enriched, enough to keep the fission process moving but not enough to create a real explosion. All of the waste ever generated via uranium would fit on a football field stacked about 10ft tall.) Nuclear is built into the infrastructure of today and currently, there is no substitute for Uranium. Talk of thorium, tokamaks, and fast breeders (only 3 out of 444 current nuclear reactors) is all well and good, but it is not where we are today (and for the next decade as building these things is no fast matter, the average build time of a reactor is 109 months). You all might be retarded but you're not dumb, I don't want to see any talk about how nuclear is bad for the environment in the comments. \u200b Excerpt from American Jobs Plan Fact Sheet \u200b Structural supply deficit: We use roughly 180m lbs of uranium per year, and we mine around 130m lbs per year. For the innumerate among us, that's a 50m lb/year deficit that needs to come from somewhere. Where does this come from? After Fukushima in 2011, Japan started to shut down nuclear reactors and had lots of inventory that they needed to sell, flooding the market. We can also re enrich the tail assays of spent fuel rather than storing and disposing of it. With excess capacity on the market, the opportunity cost of underfeeding is lowered and more enrichers started to do this (enrichers have caps on the amount of enriching they can do). As mining and enriching of natural uranium increases, more enrichers will have to switch their facilities over and underfeeding will decrease. Utilities also contracted many years in advance at high prices that made sense for the miners during the previous bull cycle - these contracts are beginning to expire. These (and more) factors caused uranium prices to plummet to the current level of $30/lb on the spot market. At these levels, it does not make sense for many mines to operate and thus the 50m lb/year deficit. Obviously, this cannot continue indefinitely or the lights will go out. At some point, the cost of uranium must go up to incentivize miners to begin mining again. The average incremental price to mine uranium is around $60/lb, so it is safe to assume that they will not begin mining again until they get contracts for around this price (depending on the mine and the Capex necessary to get it out of care and maintenance). Uranium cannot be procured immediately and is done years in advance. During the last bull cycle many utilities signed contracts for 5+ years. These contracts are beginning to fall off , leaving a lot of uncovered demand for utilities in the future. They have not been worried about it thus far- carry traders have been buying in the spot and selling over the next year or two to these utilities who are happy not signing long-term contracts while the price has been falling. When the tide turns, you can expect fuel buyers to again begin signing long-term contracts to ensure security of supply. Once prices start rising, the stampede of fuel buyers looking to sign long-term contracts to secure supply will begin. It is human nature, in addition to the fact that it is a fireable offense to not be able to procure Uranium for your reactor, while it is not a fireable offense to grossly overpay as long as others are doing the same. Security of supply is very important in this industry, China recently paid almost half a billion dollars for a 49% equity stake in a Kazakhistan based miner. They will still have to pay the market price for the Uranium, but they get first dibs on almost half of the Uranium mined. The utilities are highly price-insensitive - it is much more costly to have a multi-billion dollar nuclear reactor go offline than pay higher prices for Uranium (which make up about 3% of the cost to run the reactor to put it into perspective). When the first utilities begin signing these contracts, the others will quickly follow suit. The price of uranium went from $10/lb in 2003 to over $130/lb in 2008. Over the next several years as uncovered demand begins to start showing up, the utilities will realize that almost a decade of underpaying for Uranium is now going to come knocking. $60/lb is the floor price, capital markets could easily propel the price way higher. \u200b Catalysts: So when will excess inventories be drawn down? (CEO of small cap company) had the following to say about uranium major Kazatomprom's purchases from the spot market to fulfill obligations \"what is interesting about Kazatomprom's news is not that they need to buy from spot ... but rather that they have started purchasing so early.\" Other Uranium miners are purchasing from the spot market as well. If miners thought there was plenty of supply, they would run down their inventories and repurchase at a later date. This is not the case and is very revealing. (Small cap company) recently purchased 2.5m lbs of uranium that required 17 different contracts with 12 counterparties - not very indicative of the oversupply we have had in prior years. I (and all the experts I have been listening to) believe that the spot market is getting thin. This is crucial, when fuel buyers start to see the spot market as thin is when the feedback loop begins. But no one wants to be the first mouse to eat the cheese. (CEO of Small Cap company) sums up his conversations with fuel buyers by saying \"We'd rather be the last guy in at $65 than the first guy in at $50...no one wants to be the price maker, the first guy going in at above the odds. But no one minds being the last guy because 'You're the hero, you secured the supply'\". \"We are playing a game of musical chairs, the music is gonna stop, and everyone is just going to grab a chair and pay what they have to.\" Mike Alkin says (paraphrasing again) \"They don't get rewarded if they save the rate payers money, and they don't get penalized if they have to pay up as long as the peers are doing it...They just have different incentives\" The supply will propel it to $50/lb to continue production, $60/lb to undertake new exploration/production, and capital markets can take it much higher. A capital market vessel is that could also act as a catalyst is Sprott Asset Management. Sprott is entering into an agreement with Uranium Participation Corp to form the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust. It is expected to begin trading on American markets in the second half of 2021 (currently there is the Uranium Participation Corp which does this poorly and not on American markets). The fund will begin buying and holding physical Uranium similar to GLD holding gold, putting further pressure on supply levels. Remember how (small cap company) had to have 17 different transactions to purchase 2.5m lbs? Sprotts gold trust is 4.6b, and its silver trust is 2.4b. It will market to all of its commodities holders- even a market cap of 1/10 or 1/5 of these funds could be a serious catalyst towards causing utilities to sign long-term contracts. This happens right around the time that the uranium contracting cycle begins. When hedge funds sense blood in the water they will join the frenzy as well - there is speculation that the funds are already building their positions. Commodities are a good place to be during times of inflation and it appears as though inflation is coming as Jpow keeps the money printer running and lets inflation heat up. This could be a good hedge against high-growth tech stocks. \u200b \u200b Conclusion: Uranium miners have begun to move upwards, indicating the sentiment shifting that the cycle is turning. I don't have a stock to sell you, there are only around 40 on the market and I chose a few to begin building my position with rather than taking the risk on one. Below is a chart with some information about different mines to help you get started. There is much more that could/should be added but for the sake of brevity I will limit it to this. It is now time to wait for the price discovery in this small opaque market to begin...stated in layman terms, this is not priced in \u200b Summary of Mines", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-07 09:37:05", "id": "n6jqm0"}

Yadda yadda, not financial advice, if you buy yourself a ticket to Ramenistan that's on you. My favorite color of crayon is purple. I'm new to this sort of thing (first write-up I've ever made lol) so I want holes to be poked in this relatively surface level DD. I'm also not the most knowledgeable on the intricacies of the steel manufacturing industry, since I'm going off of pure numbers. With COVID recovery underway and the slow unfreezing of world economies, steel companies have been outperforming the S&P 500 by large margins, and this is one of those companies. I've noticed that compared to other players in the steel industry (X, NUE, STLD for example) MT's price is much lower than these players, and yet their fundamentals are roughly the same, if not better.

However, the US government's infrastructure development plans could offset any pitfalls in demand made by COVID. ArcelorMittal also holds the #1 spot as the world's premiere steel producer, with a presence in around 60 countries and has consistently growing sales figures.

{"text": "What is Upstart? (from their IR): Upstart\u2019s (Nasdaq: UPST) mission is to enable effortless credit based on true risk. We are a leading artificial intelligence (AI) lending platform designed to improve access to affordable credit while reducing the risk and costs of lending for our bank partners. Our platform uses sophisticated machine learning models to more accurately identify risk and approve more applicants than traditional, credit-score based lending models. Why should I care? Upstart is one of the few \"AI\" companies outside of FAANG to actually: Make a profit (they are GAAP net income profitable) Demonstrate product-market fit Upstart's business is in lending, a market that has a number of characteristics that make it a highly optimal AI use case. The end goal can be clearly defined and measured. Make higher-alpha lending decisions vs traditional (human-driven) credit analysts and over-reliance on credit scores. More accurate credit risk evaluation by AI means more people can be approved for more loans with fewer defaults. Upstart claims it excels when evaluating risk for individuals (like immigrants, younger lenders) that have no credit score or a borderline credit score that would usually get them denied elsewhere. Upstart also claims ( that at the same approval rate, they are able to hit 75% fewer defaults, which means more $$$ for lenders who use their platform. Around 71% of loans originated by UPST are instantly approved and fully automated, a big plus in the current consumer environment that expects instant gratification. A robust supply of underlying data UPST's AI models (their secret sauce) use a combination of Employment History, Credit Experience, Education, Cost of Living, Bank Transactions, and Application Interaction (with probably thousands of data points per model). Being able to leverage data points that would normally not be factored in to a human credit analyst' decision-making presents clear potential for increased performance. Easily scalable to adjacent applications The TAM for unsecured personal loans (according to TransUnion for Q4 2019-Q3 2020) is $92B. That's a huge addressable market for Upstart, but what makes the company even more exciting is their recent expansion to Auto Loans. UPST announced their acquisition of Prodigy Software last quarter, a software company that created an end-to-end platform to allow dealerships to offer buy-now-pay-later deals to customers buying cars as a bolt-on (no-effort for dealerships, they get a cut of the profits). This is huge in terms of expanding UPST' addressable market - Auto Retail is probably the biggest BNPL markets with around $626B in Q4 2019-Q3 2020 originations. If this acquisition is successful in hitting the same metrics, it would demonstrate the \"platform\" appeal of UPST's technology - a plug-n-play AI engine that can be adapted to different market contexts. Why now? UPST made a meteoric move upwards on their last earnings call by backing up their claims with real hard $$ numbers and highly optimistic guidance. Not going to go in depth on the numbers as you can read those for yourself, but I think the key thing to take away here is their guidance for FY21 - approx $500M in revenue. If they hit or exceed this, it would demonstrate a huge inflection point in their growth and a sign that their technology has hit a point where it is generating significant value for bank partners. Like with most platform-driven companies, this sort of trend up after a couple years of foundation-building is exactly the indicator they are looking for to call success / failure on the whole thing. Since their last ER, UPST has fallen from ATH's and is now around the $90 range. Growth companies in general are struggling pretty broadly. Similar companies like Affirm (AFRM) have dropped even further recently on headwinds for BNPL fintech platforms and increased competition. Market pressure downward aside, I think UPST currently has amazing fundamentals: best-in-breed tech platform, best talent & team, and the best competitive position to take over this emerging market - any further concrete evidence of this in Q1 2021 tomorrow could take this very sharply upward, and I don't think enough people are aware of this fact. Risks: Continued market pressure on growth / fin-tech stocks. Anything less than stellar delivery on current guidance Weak guidance for Q2 End Notes: Things to pay attention to in their earnings call 1) early indications of traction in the auto loan market post-acquisition 2) any updates and new strategies for BD / product strategy going forward into 2021. they recently did a post-IPO secondary offering @ $120, hopefully they will elucidate more on what they plan to do with the money riased * 3) they recently launched the UPST referral network, that basically offers a plug-n-play, whitelisted consumer loan portfolio solution to banks and credit unions who don't have the resources to build it all out in-house. very curious to see UPST's evaluation of the potential market for this and any traction in the past month since they released ( My position: Mostly shares, some highly OTM calls (super cheap rn) for 5/21 to capitalize on the post-earnings upside potential.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-11 06:28:40", "id": "n9drvm"}
{"text": "\u200b Disclaimer: this is not financial advice. I\u2019m big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I\u2019ve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I\u2019ve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria: Short % of float must be over 20% (over 28% of $RIDE\u2019s float is short Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE\u2019s 6-month chart for reference). $MVIS comparison: Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago. I actually googled \u201cHindenburg MVIS\u201d and the second article that popped up was titled \u201cTechnically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.\u201d This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air. More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE\u2019s pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this has been clear ever since $RIDE went public is currently developing their full-size all electric Endurance truck in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.\u201d They have shown their betas to the public short-seller report. He called it \u201c\u2018bull\\\\\\\\. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don\u2019t get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.\u201d Secretary of State Frank LaRose plant recently. He said he\u2019s seen the company\u2019s robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he\u2019s seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. \u201cThey\u2019re way way way far along,\u201d he said. \u201cWhoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.\u201d I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE\u2019S MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY loan]( which should be announced by the end of Q2 2021 (literally any day now). Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World. Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I\u2019m planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings. TL;DR: $RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it\u2019s only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20\u2019s.

Requiescat in pace you poor apes. If you need some help for your shell shock, or someone to blame, I direct you to the CEO of UWMC.

Okay, memes aside, let us get to the deets. UWMC Share Structure: \\- Class A Shares of which there is a dividend of 40 cents a share per year. Represents 6% of the Company and is in the public float. \\- Class D shares with 10 votes per each share, but no dividend. However, the Class D shares are capped at 79 Percent Voting Rights. Which means that the Class A shares represent 21% voting rights. LDI Highlights: \\- Spent 200 Million on a special dividend of .69, and announced they were very likely to give a .08 cent quarterly dividend starting in Q2. They issued senior bond notes at 6.25% to fund this, as well as other things. \\- Stock price was up as much as 7.5 percent before market open, and then tanked. LDI: [ RKT: [ (Q1 2021) [ (Q4 2020) [ (Earnings Call) UWMC: \\- [Weekly Fastbreak With Mat Ishbia Archived Episodes | UWM. \\- Prime Jumbo Expansion \u2013 Raised Max limit to 3Million, allowed RSU income, and more such as only one appraisal to 1 Million. \u00e0 These are being serviced directly by UWMC so they have a lot of flexibility on them. (They relaunched it on March 17th, and are already making it a better offering) \\- Lowered their FHA minimum score to 620 on Government Loans, among a few other changes. \\- ARMS are back. 5-, 7-, and 10-year rates. They can save 5/8th of a rate at the 7 year ARM. Sharp pricing. Adds options to brokers. 7 Tear one is good for refinance candidates according to the CEO. \\- Prime Jumbo 30 Year Released. These ones are not going to be serviced by UWMC but will instead be sold on. Their offering better pricing than their portfolio prime jumbo. However, guidelines and matrix are slightly tighter. o But the portfolio prime jumbo regular program is going to have over 2 billion in May alone. They are the only ones who have a product where they retain their jumbos. \\- Ultimate Submissions \u2013 Using 6-8 of these will. Goanna cut 3.5 off the CTC process, and also shave 1 day off your processor touch. UWMC Estimated Loan Volume for Q1 and Estimated forward guidance for Q2 \\- UWMC had closed Loan volume of 54.7 Billion in Q4 2020, with a gain margin of 3.05%. o RKT barely met expectations which it had set for closed loan volume, and missed revenue and EPS estimates, which is unacceptable considering that every other mortgage company (Redwood Trust, LDI) that has reported has beat it out of the park. LDI beat EPS by 73.03% and beat Revenue by 30.38% for example. They also announced a special dividend of .69 and announced they are looking to set a dividend of 8 cents a quarter starting in Q2 of 2021. o RKT gain on sale margin reduced from 2.57% to 1.93% on their partner network for Q1 2021. Please note that this is not the wholesale channel completely as their two primary partnership types are marketing and influencer. \u00a7 This represents a 24.9% decrease in gain on sale margin from Q4 2020, or 249 Basis Points. o LDI\u2019s partner channel gain on sale margin decreased from 2.58% to 1.85%. That is a 28.2% or 282 Basis Point Decrease. o LDI\u2019s Partner Channel is through the whole sale channel, and through Joint Venture\u2019s with Home Builders. However, the actual volume remains unmoved. Rate locks decreased from last quarter. It stood at 9.645 last quarter, but only 8.688 this quarter. While Loan Originations only increased from 7,730,101 to 8,051,362. We can assume this was largely off their Joint Venture with Home Builders. \\- UWMC is expecting Closed Loan Volume of between $52 and $57 Billion for Q1 2021. o On CNBC their CEO stated they were right in the middle, however the April bump in refinance activity and purchase activity as rates eased down back under 3% likely gave them the boost they needed. o Reopening the spigot on Jumbo Loans and FHA loans (while ensuring a fantastic Q2) will help raise closed loan volume for Q1 2021 as Jumbo only accounted for 583,299 in 2020 but 3,570,520 for 2019. \u00a7 They are increasing their capacity and driving more wholesale brokerage business to them as a percentage of that wholesale broker\u2019s business by expanding their Jumbo Offerings and increasing capacity, while making them more attractive. You should see strong tailwinds for Q2 2021 which has been talked about by UWMC\u2019s CEO. o Reopening the spigot on FHA loans will create a lot of closed loan volume as FY 2019 was 13,151,943 but FY 2020 was only 8,619,874. \u00a7 They are increasing their capacity and driving more wholesale brokerage business to them as a percentage of that wholesale broker\u2019s business by expanding their FHA Offerings and increasing capacity, while making them more attractive. You should see strong tailwinds for Q2 2021 which has been talked about by UWM\u2019s CEO. \\- Capacity, and options for wholesale mortgage brokers are opening. The CEO of UWMC has been very big on this, and we can start seeing the fruits of this in Q2 2021. I don\u2019t expect closed loan volume for any of the new offerings from the last week or this week to impact Q1 2021, but I do expect closed loan volume to be impacted very positively for Q2 2021. \\- UWMC is expecting a gain margin of 200-220 BPS or 2%-2.20%. o However, a 24.9% decrease in gain on sale margin means a 2.29% Gain on Sale margin. Which means a 9 Basis Point beat. If, like LDI, there is margin expansion due to UWMC\u2019s tech then this could mean even more of a margin gain. o A 28.2% gain on sale margin decrease leads to a 2.19% gain on sale margin for Q1 2021. However, please note that UWMC\u2019s tech could lead to margin expansion. o I believe UWMC will fall roughly to 2.50-2.60%, but we will see on the 10th After Market. I do not mind a margin hit for market share gain, so long as that market share gain is sustainable OR the market share gain leads to revenue that offsets the gain on sale margin. \\- If LDI had no, or little, marketing expenses it would have had higher net income than Q4 2020. Rocket\u2019s marketing expenses totaled 320 Million. They have such high marketing expenses because they are retail, whereas UWMC is wholly wholesale and thus their marketing costs are much, much, less. \\- Rocket got clobbered on their wholesale channel after UWMC\u2019s ultimatum. The Wholesale Channel was one of their main growth drivers, especially in the purchase channel where they are exceptionally weak. (11 percent refinance, but only 3 percent of the purchase volume in the US). o The Partner Network for Q1 2021 only provided 40.7B in originations (Please remember that this is not just wholesale but wholesale comprises a portion). Last Quarter the Partner Channel provided 37.9B in originations. That was a 7.3% increase, which is negligible when you consider that they probably only grew from their referral channel and from the increased percentage of their business that those who did not sign the addendum from UWMC gave. You cannot have that when your direct-to-consumer channel decreased from 67.8B to 65B. Especially when your retail channel is the higher margin channel. Net revenue obviously decreased in their partner network from Q4 2020. \u00a7 I cannot reiterate how bad this is for Rocket considering their aggressive growth was coming from this area. Especially since the broker channel surpassed 20 percent this year according to AMCs for the first time since 2008. It\u2019s indicating to me that UWMC has won the broker war here, to be quite blunt, especially since UWMC\u2019s CEO keeps reiterating that he has over 10,000 Brokerages partnered with him. \\- RKT gave disappointing Q2 guidance with a significant decrease in closed loan volume of between 82.5 Billion and 87.5 Billion. Gain on sale margins of 2.65% to 2.95%. o Quite frankly, considering UWMC has stated that Q2 is going to be very, very, good\u2026 I am concerned for Rocket, especially since there is a government program coming online this summer that will help low credit score and low-income people refinance which UWMC is taking advantage of. Furthermore, the wholesale broker channel is increasing, and more and more housing inventory is coming online. Lastly, home prices are increasing. If UWMC has a revenue beat and closed loan volume beat like LDI, or even meets Q1 on the higher end and guides upward for Q2, that means that Rocket is likely capped on the wholesale channel and thus in the purchase segment and that UJWMC is gaining ground. My Thoughts Going into Earnings Quite frankly, I am positively inclined. Which makes you all think I am a moron most likely. Well, in a vacuum, yes, it would be a moronic play. However, the market\u2019s priced UWMC to fail partly because it is a mortgage company, partly because of the uncertainty with Rocket, and partly because it does not believe UWMC can beat expectations. Let us first look at P/E Ratio. Rocket had a P/E of roughly 13-13.5, whereas UWMC has a P/E ratio of 6.27 if the 1.22 FY 2020 is right. Financial Services company have a P/E Ratio of 8-10. While Rocket is the number 1 mortgage lender (with some arguing it was even worthy of tech valuation???), UWMC is the number 1 mortgage lender in the wholesale space. However, the market was looking for Rocket to completely outperform like other stocks and for guidance to be spectacular, much like other companies. The Market is looking at UWMC like it is going to fail, as it is falling below even the most conservative ratio for a financial services company and has been trending downward in the leadup to earnings. Another bearish sign from the market is the short interest of UWMC compared to RKT. RKT\u2019s short interest is 7.87% since April 15 (April 30th SI data should be released any day now). For UWMC it is 13.10% of the float, and I am guessing it is going to show an increase on the 30th. Volume for UWMC is also significantly low from its average. Which leads me to my next point. I believe in war you must strike fast, and strike hard, which UWMC did. However, markets do not like uncertainty, and the ultimatum that UJWMC gave introduced a lot of uncertainty. However, UWMC has made a lot of positive noises before Rocket\u2019s earnings, and so I was comfortable that they were winning the wholesale mortgage market war. I also quite thoroughly enjoyed their share raising moves, and their willingness to raise capacity. I did not really see that with Rocket. However, Rocket had its buyback program whereas UWMC did not have that to fall to and it led to a negative feedback loop for UWMC where people gave up, short selling occurred, and there were not really any buybacks that UWMC could do as opposed to RKT to halt the bleeding. Ultimately, RKT\u2019s earnings even led to a sympathy bleeding on UWMC in the After Hours. UWMC is down 1.79% to 7.66 after RKT\u2019s earnings, even though these two companies are diametrically opposed, and the success of one boded ill for the other. The first positive thing is that analysts\u2019 earnings are primed to be blown out of the water for Q1 and FY 2021 as well as FY 2022. Q1 2021 has analysts expecting .42 or .47 depending on where you look, but I think that is a bit low. Especially when compared to Redwood Trust and LDI. I\u2019m positively inclined here. Furthermore, LDI used 200 Million to give a .69 Special Dividend, but the stock was trading over 20-22 dollars at the time, and its announcement of a Q2 dividend announcement of 8 cents a share was unappealing considering the share price. At the current share price of 18.11 LDI would give a 1.7% annual dividend. At the current share price LoanDepot is giving a 3.81% special dividend. Compare that to UWMC which is offering a dividend yield of 5.22%, and who has announced that they were looking at a special dividend, increased dividend, or even buybacks in Q4 2020 to reward shareholders if there was excess cash. After LDI and RKT both issued a special dividend, I feel UWMC will have no choice but to do so, and a special dividend of 200 Million to Class A shares equates to 4 dollars roughly. Even if Class D shares were involved, a 40-cent special dividend to both Class D and A shares would only cost 640 million. However, I believe that the owner wants to keep as much money in the company as possible because he wants to invest it in the company which is why Class D shares do not have a dividend, but Class A shares do. If you are still unconvinced, I believe a timely look at RKT\u2019s special dividend is in order as they issued the special dividend to only Class A shares (Public shares and not owner shares), and not the Class D shares that Dan Gilbert owns. This structure also allows an outsized special dividend. I have 7.50 call Options with an average premium of 1.20. This would cost 123 million if issued to only Class A shares. In a vacuum, to profit I would only need a special dividend of $1.20, though this will not be in a vacuum. A special dividend that large would force people to cover if they are shorting, for one, and this special dividend would be issued under the auspices of Russell inclusion in late June, A strong Q1 and a very strong Q2 Guidance. Furthermore, as the normal dividend is announced the share price would elevate by that amount, before falling after the ex-dividend date. If the share price instead falls or remains flat, I can exercise my shares and take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity. Mortgage Servicing Rights alone can service the dividend (41.5 Million per year), and the interest on the bonds (80 Million), while also allowing the company to further invest or allocate to bond principal. The Senior Notes are themselves easily repaid. Ultimately, I have 4525 shares of UWMC that I have been continuously adding to, and I have 25 7.5 Calls for May 21 at an average of 1.20 that I have also been adding to including the last 2 days for both calls and shares. I am looking to add a call, and perhaps a tad more shares to UWMC. Yes, I am aware of IV Crush, and of Theta Decay. The theta decay stands at 1.9% which is acceptable to me, and I believe considering the confluence of events, the positive noises that the CEO has made for Q2 2021, the short interest, and the strong downward pressure on UWMC indicating the market believes the company will completely miss earnings, as well as the overt indication and peer pressure to issue a special dividend will ensure that the IV will remain elevated after earnings. I would not advise this for the faint of hearts, or if you have a kid on the way and life savings to burn, but this is one of the few times where buying calls from theta gang might mean they cry, and you fly (upward). With that said, be aware of IV Crush and be aware that I have allocated 3,127$ and might up this to 3,200 roughly considering Rocket\u2019s earnings. I have nearly 40,000 in UWMC, so this is by no means a majority position. Furthermore, I am somewhat cushioned as this is not a weekly. To be clear, this is a YOLO, but a conservative one (sans the options). I also have money in my bank, so it is not like this will render me homeless. I am not a financial advisor. Do what you will with this information. I look forward to the earnings call on the 11th. Big Update: The Dividend now stands at roughly 5.7%, and has a standalone p/e ratio of 17.5 which is equivalent to BAC. The Forward P/E at an analyst estimate of 1.22 is 5.73 for FY 2021 and a little lower for FY 2022. I believe that 2021 will have at minimum a EPS of 1.5, and so that gives a forward P/E of 4.67 for FY 21.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-06 16:36:05", "id": "n605e7"}

{"text": "I know there have been several posts about GE. Some of them seemed pretty spot-on while others seemed like FUD or unresearched nonsense. I've been banging this drum for a while in my own circles and now that I've got enough Karma to post to WSB I give to you.... GE - The Great American comeback TLDR ----- General Electric (GE) was a on its death bed and the stock had tanked. They are right at the pivot point in a MASSIVE turnaround and this thing is going to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80.

Other June and the July stuff I'm gonna ride for a bit and try and get some money. On the following pull back / consolidation phase I'll buy calls for the next leg. DD and back story - The Good We'll get to that part in a bit The bad The history: GE was a massive company, has been around forever and was known as one of the quintessential American companies. They became this massive conglomerate that bought up companies left and right leading up to the mortgage backed securities bonanza in the mid 2000's. Not sure I'll need to remind everyone what happened at the end of that (Rhymed with Semen Mothers) but GE took it particularly bad. See after the 2008 / 2009 meltdown it turned out that not only had they lost a ton of money on derivatives and other financial products but (as would become public later) they lied to investors about it on disclosures and jumped through hoops to keep investors from finding out just how bad the situation was. Add to that some really badly timed all cash acquisitions that worked out terribly and the company was about ready to go belly up. The Ugly There is a reason that while the whole world got its act back together after 2009, GE continued to play act a paraplegic thrown in the deep end of a pool. The stock took beating after beating as news kept coming out about acquisitions that went bad (massive write downs), accounting fraud and various other losses. After getting rid of their CEO they brought in someone else to try and turn things around, then after a very short run they replaced that guy with the current CEO Larry Culp. They basically had to bribe / beg him to take the job, getting him to leave a cushy gig at Harvard where he was basically in working retirement after having earned a reputation as a corporate turn around guru. Making our way back to the good While GE's stock continued to flounder Culp got busy and started to shake things up. First he started selling divisions and companies. Some of them had been with GE forever, like the lightbulb divisions, others were acquisitions (some of which only a few years old) that were sold off. This wasn't about profiting by spinning something off - it was about cutting losses and making sense out of a massive company that didn't have a functioning balance sheet. Some of the chunks that were sold were profitable and many were not. The net effect was that he cut operating expenses more than he cut operating revenue, moving free cash flow (FCF) in the right direction (albeit still negative at this point) and raising cash from the sales. They slashed the dividend to 1 penny. People were clutching their pearls and screaming! I mean... It was GE for Pete's sake. They've had a good dividend forEVER! This dragged the stock down more. But it shoved FCF in the right direction. Between significantly improved FCF and money raised from selling off divisions and assets GE managed to cut its TOTAL debt from $130 BILLION to $71 BILLION (which is about where it is right now, although they do have more than $25 billion cash on hand). Oh yeah they also own 25% of Baker Hughes (valued at about $6.5 billion, that is after they sold $1 billion worth of it recently), they are also selling GECAS (airline leasing company that owned airliners and rented them out to airlines and other companies) to the global leader in the space. In return for shedding this division, which due to structural issues and insufficient scale to create real efficiencies, was losing GE $700 million a year in FCF, GE is getting $24 billion in cash, $1 billion in cash equivalents and $6 billion worth of a company (45% of the company's stock) that happens to be beaten up at the moment but is the world's largest airline leasing company and is about to have a gang buster year as airlines struggle to find planes. Could easily see the value of that swelling and then them dumping it to pay down even more debt. The Good - you may have to squint but it is there. I swear GE is now a rather lean company, especially compared to the mess that existed 5 years ago. I've given you the current cash / debt position. From that alone, doesn't seem great but I do ask that you keep in mind the trend line, from $130BB to $71BB over 5 years. Today GE is made up of 4 divisions (they no longer make home appliances, it isn't one of the divisions. yes I know, they still are on the market but the stuff sold under the GE name in home appliances is by actually made by the Haier conglomerate and.... never mind): HealthCare \\- Not sure if any of you have had an MRI but if you had you may have had the same weird experience I did. Walking into the room, kind of nervous to get this big medical test to find out what is wrong with my ::Insert body party here:: and being confronted with the biggest GE logo I have EVER seen. Embossed into the side of this MRI machine. Anyway, whether you were aware of it or not GE makes a lot of tech for healthcare. from MRI machines to ultrasounds and tons of other stuff. It is a growing business that is consistently profitable and something :: cough cough COVID knocked us on our butt and hospitals need to retool and get better:: tells me that healthcare spending is going to be rising a lot this year and next year. Energy - Basically this is about steam turbines used for 20th century electricity generation (and storage in some cases). Talking huge turbines used in natural gas, oil, coal, nuclear and geothermal power plants (I think GE itself may consider Hydro power plant turbines part of this sector but I'm listing them below because that makes more sense). While not very forward looking this business has the potential to generate significant FCF over the next few years maybe even a decade or more. While some of these power sources are on their way out others (like natural gas) have seen a surge in utilization and some (nuclear) seem to be about to make a comeback. This chunk of GE is usually profitable, although not hugely so. That being said, between what happened in Texas which will require several power plants to be overhauled or replaced, existing service and new equipment contracts and the potential to grow, I think this is a worthwhile business unit to keep around. Renewable Energy - Some solar, a decent amount of hydro power, a growing pumped storage segment and WIND TURBINES. These electrical generators (and in the case of pumped storage - mechanical batteries) are one of the most exciting areas for me personally when looking at the GE story. GE briefly snagged the title as producing the world's largest wind turbine (14 MW) and it is the largest one that many countries have certified for use. This thing is bonkers, every rotation of the blades produces enough electricity to power roughly 4,000 homes for a DAY. It is a monster and it has been selected for use in the next phase of the world's largest offshore wind farm and the first phase of the US' first large offshore windfarm. GE also makes onshore wind turbines, they make the truly massive turbines used in huge hydro electric damns and they also make turbines for use in pumped storage\\. This segment has up till now been generation negative FCF (losing money) however it is growing by leaps and bounds and seems poised to start adding to positive FCF a little this year or next and then growing exponentially. \\Pumped storage is really cool. Basically you create a large body of water (like a lake) by using excess electricity made by solar and wind when it is available to pump water up hill. Then, when you need more electricity because it is night time or the wind isn't blowing you throw the turbine in reverse and it acts as a hydro electric damn. Aviation \\- This is the crown jewel of GE although in a weird twist of fait it delivered a kick to the nuts just as things started turning around. Needless to go into much detail as to why a business that makes its money building and servicing jet engines might be negatively effected when air travel takes a year and a half pause. That being said GE's newest engines are showing a great track record of winning orders. Doing this DD I found out that apparently when you buy commercial airliners you get to pick what engines you want (if there are more than one option) kind of like when you buy a car and pick whether you want the in dash CD player or not. GE's engines are proving to be more efficient, more reliable and cheaper to operate than their main competitor Pratt and Whitney. That means that as everyone gets waxed and vaxed in preparation for the horney party boom we are about to witness airlines have started ordering planes again and in a big way. You see, during the covid crisis airlines didn't have many customers and what most of them did was they identified their oldest and/or most problematic aircraft and sold them off various other companies in other industries or to companies that lease aircraft to airlines when they need a few to fill a gap. Now that things are coming back online airlines are ordering more planes. As other parts of the world start to open up over time this should create sustained tail winds for this division. Oh yeah and one thing that often seems to be overlooked is that while yes, the aviation division has been beat up, management has used this as an opportunity to streamline and improve operations. Both sales and maintenance saw significant drops in revenue however the drop in FCF was smaller than would be expected because the whole time GE was improving its margins. Now as their order book starts filling up the aviation division is significantly leaner and more optimized which should mean that when the FCF starts up again this fall or this winter it should turn into a firehose. Other points of interest GE has announced a 1 for 8 stock split (that is a reverse split, for every 8 shares you own you will end up with 1 share that is worth 8X the pre split value). This makes sense for a few reasons. 1. GE has a massive number of shares outstanding and doing this reverse split will bring its stock price (adjusted for market cap) within line with its piers and should put it in a position to re-enter the DOW. Doing so will create demand for the shares as it is added to funds that track that index. 2. Once GE reinstates its dividend (which will be another catalyst for the stock to continue upwards) the lower share count means a slower drain on FCF since I imagine they will incrementally increase the dividend. It seems silly because it doesn't really matter how many shares except when you consider that they have so many that if you decide to go from a dividend of $0.01 to $0.10 the difference in share float would be hundreds of millions annualized in FCF. Obviously the target yield wouldn't be impacted but even this small thing can have a real impact in speeding up the debt reduction. 3. I fully expect that as the stock price increases and then the reverse split happens GE will do a share issuance to raise a few billion to pay down the debt. I view that as a buying opportunity as any drop in share price should be short lived and I expect the resulting reduction in debt will mean net / net share prices will increase due to the issuance. On that note GE has committed to a stated target of 2.5 times EBITDA (which is the cutoff for investment grade securities) from the current 6 times EBITDA. Getting to investment grade will create increased upside pressure, that is why I'm saying the stock will go up when they issue more shares (even though there will likely be a temporary dip at that time).", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-28 10:26:46", "id": "nmkhyz"}

Evidence #1 - US Dollar and inflation adjusted \u200b Inflation adjusted shows the truth to how your purchasing power has been subdued, even if the US Dollar index had strong bear market rallies since 1980.

Evidence #2 - Gold vs Dow Ratio \u200b Point and figure charts remove time scale meaning, and add new columns only when price action reverses sufficiently (else it just fluctuates in same column). When US equities go in BUBBLE MODE, gold (and silver) get relatively cheaper, creating a low risk, high reward entry points. We are at similar points prior to a 1929 crash or 1972 inflation cycle. Buying silver or gold now is not buying EXPENSIVE, but historically CHEAP. Evidence #3 - Silver vs Dow's 3 \"inflation adjusted\" cycles \u200b Arcs are a powerful tool to identify a downtrend, the slowing of that downtrend, and the eventual rise from the ashes. When you get 2 bounces off the right hemisphere, the new uptrend is confirmed and probabilities of a sustained uptrend is increased. Angle of descent is usually angle of exit. This JUST happened now.

If you are taking financial advice from me, you\u2019re in deep shit. That said\u2026 Hi everybody! Cleveland-Cliffs (Ticker: CLF) is an American steel company and in this post I will explain why I made it my biggest position since the MVIS short squeeze. In short, $CLF is a vertically integrated steel company: It mines ore (the largest ore producer in the country!) and turns that ore into steel and sells that steel. Steel is used to make a gazillion different products, from cars to forks to buildings. Now that a supply chain crunch has hit, steel prices are skyrocketing literally everyday. It closed at $20.36 yesterday. The stock has significant short interest - Ortex reported 11.26% a few days ago. These shorts are probably screwed soon, because CLF is a great long-term hold & the market is waking up to it. CAVEAT: I was hoping to have a few more days to write this post, but $CLF started ripping upwards yesterday. The media began reporting more heavily on steel prices and commodities super cycles over the last week, perhaps because steel prices have gotten too obscene or because Warren Buffett mentioning steel this weekend. So I am rushing my writing of this a bit, because I want to get this out while I believe the getting is still real good. I will try to hit the main points, both bull and bear. ### OK OK gimme the juice: Why did $CLF break upwards yesterday? # \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Macroeconomic conditions have aligned for CLF to become the top steel company in the USA for decades to come. ### 1. Inflation \ud83c\udf4c Have you heard about how the price of the stuff that makes everything is surging warned about hyperinflation months ago (Here\u2019s one of the top DD posts all-time on WSB about this: Why Father Burry is calling the big short 2.0 - I have translated his message into a language you autists may, with effort, be able to understand. Three words: Inflation. is that steel prices are surging: US Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel Futures Contracts the largest producer of hot-rolled steel in America and stands ready to benefit from this inflation. ### 2. American supply chains are fucked. \ud83d\udd73 As a result of tax incentives, lax enforcement, and \u201cfree trade\u201d agreements, American industrial/manufacturing capacity has been devastated over the last 40 years (politicians love to talk about how \u201cjobs have been shipped overseas\u201d, but not fix it). Well, the chickens came home to roost during Covid-19, which I would argue accelerated many timelines, including a supply chain crunch. America is being forced to come to grips with the importance of being able to produce essential goods internally. Steel is a pillar of the economy. President Trump supported the industry with tariffs, and President Biden has continued them. ### 3. China has stopped dumping steel on the market. China is now competing for scrap metal. Both of these things make the price of steel rise. \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3\ud83d\udcc8 For years, the Chinese government supported steel production as a jobs program for its citizens. This resulted in China having way too much steel, so they dump it into the international market at a discount. This drives the price of steel lower. China\u2019s methods of steel production have been an unmitigated environmental disaster. But it\u2019s 2021, baby! China is now committed to cleaning things up & is revamping how it makes steel. This has multiple implications that affect the international steel market. First, China is making less steel \ud83d\udc49 They\u2019re no longer dumping it into the international market, which was driving prices down. So now steel prices are going boom boom. \ud83d\udcb8 Second, China is using a different steel-making process, one that is more reliant on scrap metal. That means China is now buying up scrap metal. China is great at getting its hands on raw materials \u2014 it\u2019s government generally acts more quickly to developing macroeconomic conditions than the American government. They have been buying up commodities for years. Bloomberg: China\u2019s Commodities Binge Makes America\u2019s Future More Expensive ### 4. A Squeeze is beginning in the American scrap metal market. \u26d3 Nearly 70% of the Steel used in the US is recycled from scrap. Steel used in construction has a 90% recycling Rate. . ### 5. CLF is not reliant on scrap. CLF will have higher profit margins. \ud83d\ude80 CLF mines its own ore. It does not need to buy scrap to make steel. In fact, it can sell steel iron ore to other companies if it chooses. This means CLF is going to have increasingly large product margins from the insane steel prices. ### 6. CLF is gonna be able to deliver product - essential to American infrastructure. America needs steel during the current commodities supercycle & it will turn to Cleveland-Cliffs. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8* CLF is American as fuck. Its roots go all the way back to 1847, and it was founded by a member of the famous Mather family (remember the Cotton Mather guy who presided over the Salem Witch Trials?). It is traditionally a mining company, but in 2020, they acquire AK Steel and also ArcelorMittal\u2019s US holdings (in a down market!). Now they\u2019re vertically integrated, mining iron and spewing out high-quality steel. This mining history and very recent acquisitions are two reasons why so many analysts have overlooked CLF until the last few weeks. The acquisitions are not priced in, except insofar as everyone has ragged on CLF for taking on a lot of debt to do this. Fair, I guess, but have you seen those steel prices? CLF is going to be able to pay its debt down in record time, then start sloughing off cash. The steel price surge is not yet priced into many steel stocks, and I think CLF has the most room to run out of all of them. CLF is also highly likely to benefit from any big infrastructure bill. They have a unionized workforce, and are likely to benefit from government largesse in big construction projects. # \ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udc3b\ud83d\udc3b The main risk points How did CLF find itself in such an amazing position at the early phase of a commodities supercycle? It\u2019s CEO, the Brazilian Lourenco Goncalves, is a luminary in the steel industry. He engineered CLF\u2019s takeover of Arcelor-Mittal\u2019s US assets and AK Steel in 2020, which put them in this perfect position . He\u2019s also famous for telling a Goldman Saches analyst (with a \u201chold\u201d rating\u2026) that he was going to embarrass them so badly, they would have to kill themselves. If Lourenco continues to guide CLF to a preeminent position in steel, a commanding height of the economy, then books will be written about his reign, a la Lee Iacocca. The man is a mastermind \u2014 it would be a blow to lose him. A horrendous balance sheet from their 2020 acquisitions. CLF financed last year\u2019s takeovers with expensive debt. However, this is exactly what the famous CEO said he is fixing first. With the enormous steel price increase locked in for the next year, he should be able to pay it down rapidly. This is one of the main reasons this company is still so cheap, imo. The market is cottoning on rapidly, though. Biden repeals steel tariffs. Commodity prices historically moved in cycles, with occasional \u201csuper cycles\u201d, which are more extended periods of high demand. Analysts are increasingly reporting that we\u2019re moving into a supercycle. The risk here is that something kills the supercycle. For example, the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 killed the last supercycle. High short interest. With all of this positive news, you may be shocked - shocked!! - that there are a lot of folks on Wall Street who have decided to short this all-American company.

{"text": "For you my man u/truth2252 I'm actually kicking myself slightly - SDC popped up on my radar a few weeks ago but I was too lazy to follow up. SDC experienced quite a price drop, probably mitigated by two main forces that are seen quite often: a seemingly strategic interplay between short coverings and option hedging. Let's take a look at the past to see the future: Notice anything? The price was steadily dropping since \\~mid January during which time a short squeeze was produced. The price drop was also good for covering the shorts that were produced then: This was a stable-decline it seems as volatility was decreasing as well with a peaceful glide down. Until April when volatility started to rise. Did the shorts become difficult to cover due to stalling in price-action? Did the increase in shorting cause volatility to rise? Did someone ask to speak to the manager? Who knows. A clue is the large chunk of options that are placed at $10. Typically a stock that is shorted with relatively 'decent' amounts, and has a large chunk of options at a particular strike further down the slide will glide towards that price-point (In this case $10). Having over-shorted and ITM long calls is a dangerous combo but if the stock can glide down past $10, while keeping volatility low - the hedges get covered and the ITM calls become OTM. All's well in the option's universe. This was disrupted it seems sometime mid-april when volatility started to rise: causing those ITM calls to have to be hedged via purchasing. Not ideal. In any case moves were moved, decisions made, deals with the devil made, and the price snapped back below $10 (opportunistic hedging lumped into one mass play? Who knows I'm not fucking nostradomus). May (the) 4th (be) with (you) saw a huge price drop (\\~20%) and almost complete resolution of liquidity issues (IV plummeted). Now, volatility is nice and minimal, option placements indicate healthy environment. So I would expect a steady increase back up to at least $10.

{"text": "tl;dr: PLUG has rallied on relief from the completion of its restatement, but accounting red flags remain -- and the economics are as bad as ever. Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's belated 10-K filing in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened. The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones. Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being \"in the money\" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products. Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG \"has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting\" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in \"Unresolved Staff Comments\": > On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters. The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing. The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-25 15:26:34", "id": "nkh20n"}

{"text": "In this article I will shortly explain the main reasons why I would buy BCRX before the Q2 EarningsReport. In case you're looking for some deeper DD, I suggest you check out the other BCRX DD article oral pill \u200b Basically Biocryst has a drug called Orladeyo, which is the first Oral approved treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with hereditary angioedema (HAE). It is estimated that HAE affects 1 in 50,000 people. \u200b Orladeyo was firstly approved in the USA December the 3rd, 2020. Q4 Orladeyo received Japan NHI price listing approval April the 14th, 2021. Q2 Orladeyo received Europe approval April the 30th, 2021 Q2 Orladeyo received UK approval May the 12th, 2021 Q2 \u200b Orladeyo is ranked out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over 41% of patients prescription we would conservatively aim for 3,075 patients. \u200b The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to 485,000$* \u200b \u200b Japan \u200b On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals. A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it. Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to at least reach 500 patients. The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to $248,500 Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a $15MM milestone payment from Torii. BioCryst will receive tiered royalties ranging from 20% - 40% of Japanese sales. \u200b \u200b Europe \u200b It's estimated to be around 12,000 HAE patients in Europe. Following the physician prescription of over 41% of patients to prescribe for Orladeyo. We get a total of 4,920 patients in Europe. Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's $248,500/year. This number should soon be confirmed. \u200b \u200b With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results. \u200b USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$ Japan - 500p x 248,5K = 124,250,000$ EU - 4,920p x 248,5K = 1,222,620,000$ \u200b Summing it all up we get $2,751,270,000. From that number we have to subtract 123,100,000$ making it a total of $2,628,170,000. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma. \u200b Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating $2,628,170,000 a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier x7. We get a total of $18,397,190,000 meaning an increase of $104,46 in the stock price. \u200b \u200b CEO himself confirmed multiple times that the company will not need to do offerings anymore. As shown in the pic below, current cash runaway takes them into 2023. \u200b \u200b Conclusion We are just about to witness how BCRX evolves from being a small-cap company to being a high-cap one. This will mainly happen due to the revenue generated by Orladeyo and the potential of BCX9930. Basically from now on each ER will be a new catalyst for BCRX. Considering how Orladeyo is still in an early launch state the revenue it generates will exponentially keep growing, so will the SP. Orladeyo undoubtly is an awesome asset for BCRX, a cash-cow. But the one drug in BCRX's pipeline that has the most promising future is BCX9930. An Oral inhibitor in PH3 which treats 8 different diseases as of now, aimming for a potential 40B market size by 2025. Deeper information about it can be found in the following article ( I currently do have a position in this company, my average entry price being around the 4$ range.

This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example). My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down ( Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future. Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year ( On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well ( So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

Although it is still considered a speculative growth stock, I believe it is trending in the right in all facets. \\\\\\My average in @ $5.10, currently at $5.52, May 20th, 2021 I am not investing in the company as a get-rich-quick scheme, but plan to hold long term. Saphyr technology will continue to improve directly with design improvements, but also indirectly with the data that it continuously collects will create more accurate correlations of DNA with individual predispositions for disease. I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company. Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community. Large institutional investments have nearly tripled (3X) from 5% to 14%. Earnings beat expectations in Q1 2021. Recent large insider procurement. New patents, research breakthroughs, Large Lab facility adoption. This is why I have a strong conviction for Bionano Genomics (BNGO) being a great growth stock to investigate and follow. There are some negative indicators fundamentally, but considering Bionano is still in its infancy I am very optimistic in my outlook.

{"text": "Before I talk Technical Analysis (TA), it is important to understand the following: Technical Analysis is absolute meaningless astrology unless the strategies and indicators used are statistically/quantitatively proven to be meaningful. There are a lot of articles being published (and even shared here) about TLRY's TA - ignore them. They have zero weight on Tilray's future. Most of these chart patterns, strategies, theories, ideas, etc. taught in traditional trading education come from early 1900's anecdotal theories, which were nothing more than early, primitive attempts to identify patterns in markets. But, this is a story and an explanation for another time. In-Depth MACD Explanation: Since it's a popular retail indicator, most of you probably already know what the Moving Average Converence/Divergence (MACD) is. However, it's usually not well understood. The MACD takes in three settings for Moving Averages (MA) and the two lines plotted on the indicator are calculated as so: MACD Line: Short MA - Long MA Signal Line: Signal MA of the MACD Line This is actually an incredibly clever way of measuring momentum and trend-following. By taking the difference between two different MA periods, we get a second-derivative (i.e. acceleration). By default, the MACD is calculated an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and with period settings (12, 26, 9). So, onto TLRY's potential momentum shift: Note that I said \"potential,\" because the land of quantitative/algorithmic trading is nothing more than a probability game developed through hypothesis testing. Today, TLRY experienced a MACD crossover with MACD settings (SMA, 28, 48, 32). Why these settings? Because I ran a statistical backtest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and simulated over 140,000 settings in an attempt to find the best practical combination to signal price change over the next few days via MACD crossover (Fun fact: using a Simple Moving Average (SMA) always yields better results, no matter what symbol or asset class). If I were to buy every MACD (SMA, 28, 48, 32) crossover at the daily closing price and hold for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 days, what would my results be? Here's the results for the SPY since 2003: Positive mean returns and a high win frequency are significant, with the 1st day after buying being the most important. So, now that we've seen it's general significance in large-cap, what are the backtested results for TLRY? Well, it's tough because Tilray hasn't had a publicly traded stock for very long, so the sample size is insufficiently small. But, take a look: It still holds some significance with the positive means and win frequencies. But obviously with only 9 crossovers happening in TLRY's lifetime, we can't take these numbers and fit them to any model. So, using the most statistically effective MACD period settings, TLRY may be getting a shift in momentum here fairly soon! I understand that my initial claims for the (28, 48, 32) settings were only tested on the SPY, and Tilray isn't large-cap growth. There is still more testing and solidifying to do. BUT, I figured you apes who are still holding are continually waiting for a confirmation bias, so here you go :)", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-22 04:50:01", "id": "nhyj2a"}
{"text": "Overview EDIT 2: position= 56 shares at $53 I'd say the majority of you apes are unaware, but American relic, GM, just released its earnings this morning and 'bullish' doesn't even begin to describe the results. While the financial figures were encouraging, with strong increases in margins carrying a lower-than-expected revenue to beat EPS expectations, it was the qualitative unveilings that I believe were of the most significance here in terms of our ability to start to imagine the GM that we will have ten years from now. \u200b Numbers Like I mentioned above, I'm not going to dive hugely into the numbers here, but I will provide an overview of some factors that I found interesting/important. Despite narrowly failing to meet revenue expectations, recording 32.47 billion vs. the expected 32.67 billion, GM managed to knock analysts' earnings per share estimates out of the park generating $2.25/share against the predicted $1.04. This is largely in thanks to really positive improvements in margins across the board, with Q1 2021 vs Q4 2020 figures as follows: Gross margin: 11.22% up from 7.96% Operating margin: 10.09% up from 7.38% Net margin: 9.31% up from 7.59% According to CEO Mary Barra, these margin improvements were put down to a strong performance in GM's finance product segment (a segment with lower overheads than manufacturing, etc), the leverage of virtual engineering programs and other software solutions to refine engineering and prototype manufacturing processes, and strong sales figures for GM's higher-margin SUVs and Pickups. Perhaps most importantly here, GM maintains its initial guidance for this year and is confident that it will not be further impacted by the semiconductor shortage that has seen the auto-sector reeling lately. They predict EBIT of $10-11 billion for this year (strongly beating annual EBIT from 2018 through to 2020), despite the prolonged semiconductor shortage's impact on manufacturing. Also of note, but to a lesser extent, is that the company has reduced its total liabilities, marginally improved its cash position, and reduced its interest costs, all while increasing its total inventory. \u200b Words Put it simply, GM appears to be positioning itself at the leading edge of mainstream America's EV adoption and will be a powerhouse in the EV industry globally for decades to come. Tesla makes incredible products and probably deserves the hype, but GM has the scale, infrastructure, and history to truly make its rollout impactful. The company is quickly positioning itself as vertically integrated, after having invested heavily in battery research, design, and manufacturing capabilities. GM's scientists have developed battery technology that can deliver 450 miles per full charge and performance of 0-60mph in 3 seconds while allowing for flexible design considerations that can be adapted for the needs of each vehicle. These statistics will only improve. GM's scientists and engineers were able to quickly adapt to the semiconductor shortage by developing new workarounds involving less rare semis or to find new solutions to old problems which in some cases have subverted the need to use semis in these cases. In my opinion, this is indicative of a high-performing engineering crew who promise to continue to be adaptable as the company moves forward into new ground. In regards to upcoming models which are scheduled for release in 2022/23, Barra states- \"The initial interest has been overwhelming, especially from commercial and government customers. We gave a small number of them a sneak peek at the interior and exterior design. They said it exceeded their high expectations with zero emissions, long range, pickup capability, innovative storage and strong value along with a powerful design.\" The keyword here is 'government'. The Biden administration pledged in January to replace the entire US federal government's vehicle fleet with EVs- [ While there is no guarantee of agreement in place that GM will be the company that meets this demand, the replacement fleet will consist of 650,000 EVs at a possible cost of over $20 billion. Obviously, the administration will want to spend this money domestically, and GM will be a front-runner for these contracts. If GM even takes in 20% of this amount, they will be able to significantly reduce long-term debt (thereby reducing operating costs moving forward and increasing margins), accelerate their investments into new ventures, or simply add the profit to their books. Other bullish signs include: \\- GM's Cruise venture, which is set to deploy 4,000 autonomous taxis to Dubai by 2030 \\-GM is developing 2 EV models for Honda which will be produced in North America. This means GM will be paid to manufacture vehicles sold at Honda's expense. \\- Brightdrop, their electric delivery company which is at the forefront of operations ready to address a $6 billion market by 2030 \u200b Discounted cash-flow model [ Here is a link to a DCF model which I've been maintaining for GM. I use 2021 EBIT guidance, and GM's Q4 2020 guidance for future growth in the years moving forward. I assume an improvement in gross margin over past years, but lower than the impressive Q1 2021 figures. Applying a 5% discount rate, the model returns a per-share price target of $117.24, and applying a 6% discount rate, we see an $82.47 target. Hope some of y'all find this useful. Please drop some feedback or corrections if I've gone wrong here and I'll look at making amendments to this DD or the model. GO GET IT. EDIT: forgot to include the link.

The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed. In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales. Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%. I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

So exactly how did they carry the company through the pandemic?). Yet WSB comes along and catapults the stock value so now these clowns are worthy of million dollar bonuses?

WSB saved the company (which is great because going to the movies is practically a need in life along with food, shelter and clothing).

{"text": "Hey all - I am a huge auto enthusiast and been following the industry closely. This is how I\u2019m betting on EVs. BB: 60 $30c 01/2022 at $0.27 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Already powering many of the telematics of current cars, BB is poised to benefit from their established relationships with big automakers. Getting certified with an automaker is not easy, so it is a barrier to entry for other companies wanting in on the action. Security and reliability are top of mind for these companies. You don\u2019t want your car to get hacked easily, so what better than a cybersecurity company that happens to also do EV software, and already has experience with ICE cars. I did a long DD here 4 months ago and still stand by it: SONY: 100 shares at $101 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 I wouldn\u2019t call this the Japanese equivalent for BB, as they aren\u2019t a cybersecurity company. But Sony has a thriving consumer and B2B business that benefits greatly from consumer demand: the fact that they are literally selling every single PS5 they make is amazing and image sensors going out on many cell phones, including Apple using both image and lidar sensors from Sony. Great solid volume of sales to stabilize the company after some stagnant years. On PS5, it\u2019s actually a good thing that there\u2019s a chip shortage. As Sony loses money on the hardware (and earn on game royalties and licenses), they are buying time to refine their manufacturing to lower costs, and lose less money on hardware sales. And because demand is so hot for the PS5, they are on track to build a bigger platform than even PS4 to charge 20-30% on every game they sell. That\u2019s some fat margin. Now, you\u2019re probably wondering\u2026wtf, I\u2019m here to read about EVs, why you telling me about PS5s? Yeah, you\u2019re right but a conglomerate like Sony is multifaceted. While they build up their EV software platform, they have cash cows in imagery and video games. And if Apple is really building an EV, I would bet (am literally betting) that they would rely on currently trusted partners like Sony for their imaging needs. You sit inside an Apple car and camera recognizes who you are and where you\u2019re sitting? Well that\u2019s probably a Sony camera\u2026or 20 of them. There will be so many cameras inside and outside of any Apple car. I mean\u2026my iPhone 12 has 4 cameras, and it\u2019s a tiny slab of glass and my family can\u2019t sit inside and drive down the road with others in the environment. And when Japanese automakers get into EVs, they\u2019ll look into a Japanese partnership. Guess who\u2019s probably in pole position? Full disclosure, I also have 150 AAPL. VW: 200 shares @ $33.32 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 You are all excited about Ford. I am too but I\u2019m not buying into them because I think they are overhyped. But what\u2019s interesting about Ford\u2019s EV play is that they are partnering with VW to do so. That means\u2026even if Ford can\u2019t sell that many cars, VW will probably still benefit from joint research development and cost sharing. We also know how much more climate change is viewed as reality in Europe, and that\u2019s VW\u2019s home territory. VW already launching EVs under Audi, Porsche in the premium sector, VW, Skoda and Seat in the value sector, and Bentley and Lamborghini will likely have their ultra premium EVs soon. But you might wonder\u2026what about Tesla? They are so great! Well yeah they aren\u2019t that bad. But VW is a goddamn monster. It\u2019s kind of cute when Tesla announces a new plant, oh this is my 4th plant! We now have Shanghai and Fremont and building out Berlin and Austin. That\u2019s cute. VW has 136 plants around the world. The economies of scale is insane and will be able to source materials for incredibly better deals. Oh and there\u2019s that other partner called Ford who builds millions of cars a year also jumping into to beat on suppliers to give them both better pricing. Welcome to the big leagues, EVs. VW is likely to launching 5-10 EVs per year, the equivalent the full Tesla line up every year. And they have Electricfy America network (and Canada) and similar in Europe. And one more thing: VW also does trucks. Like 18 wheeler trucks. They are one of the biggest manufacturers, behind brands such as Man, Scania, and Navistar. And trucks have even more of a compelling business case for EVs\u2026Will merge this part with Volvo. Volvo: 800 shares @ $26 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Going to keep this briefer because this is already a novel. Now, when I say Volvo, I don\u2019t mean Volvo Cars. That\u2019s bought by Geely and yes they are making EVs under Volvo and Polestar brands. But I\u2019m taking about AB Volvo, still out of Sweden, building trucks, mining equipment, backhoes, haul trucks and cranes. EVs are so more more compelling because of the use and mileage they get. It\u2019s not uncommon for a one year old truck to have a million miles. And as cities around the world clamp down on urban center access (congestion or polluter fees common in Europe, and allow EVs in for discount or free), EVs increasingly make more sense. You save so much on lower op/maintenance costs, avoiding tolls and tax credits. Oil prices will be going back up so saving on fuel costs is the smart thing to do. Another thing is, governments around the world are spending trillions on infrastructure stimulus. What do these trillions buy? Concrete, steel, Volvo construction equipment, labor. Where does the concrete, steel and other commodities (like rising gold and silver prices) come from? They get mined out of the ground with big Caterpillar, Liebherr and Volvo equipment. Yep, there\u2019s Volvo again! So if you believe stimulus is happening, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe inflation is real, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe EV is the future for hauling shorter distances and/or heavy loads, Volvo is a good choice. All my opinions only, not financial advice. Currency amounts all written in USD.

{"text": "Alright you smooth brained apes! I got a question for you! Why did eHealth (ticker: EHTH) report positive Q1 Results on April 29th, see their stock price jump 10% on April 3oth, and then on that same day, see their stock price drop back down to close to its open price???? Well, I used the one wrinkle in my silky smooth brain to: Value EHTH over $100 per share and; Speculate that HIG Capital might be pushing the stock price down Who is eHealth? eHealth is an insurance brokerage. Insurance companies use brokerages like eHealth and its competitors to sell insurance to individuals, families, and small businesses. As long as the people stay active (aka pay their premiums) to the insurance companies, the insurance companies pay a commission over to the brokerages. So the more people they enroll into a plan, and the longer they stay, the more they earn. eHealth operates their business in two segments: (1) Medicare, and (2) Individual, Family and Small Business. The Medicare segment represents the majority of the business and constituted approximately 89%, and 88% of revenue in 2020 and 2019 respectively. Medicare-related health insurance plans including medicare advantage, medicare supplement, and medicare part D prescription drug plans. The biggest bulk of their business is from the Medicare Advantage Insurance Plans so I\u2019ll talk about that market really quickly. Medicare Advantage is a health insurance alternative to the Original Medicare. These Plans may have lower out-of- pocket costs than Original Medicare, which is why people prefer this over the original. Generally, people aged 65 and older are eligible for Medicare. So how big is the total addressable market? Well, according to their annual report, there are \u201c10,000 people on average turning 65 every day over the next ten years\u201d. This translates to approximately 3.65M new potential enrollees per year. eHealth and its competitors all claim that the market is growing quickly and that they\u2019ve barely tapped the market. In 2020, eHealth approved only 387k members (approximately 1% of people eligible). Its direct competitors, GoHealth and SelectQuote, have made similar claims about the size of the market and have comparable market share. Additionally, eHealth has ecommerce platforms that organize and present health insurance information in various formats that enable individuals, families, and small businesses to research, analyze, compare, and purchase a range of health insurance plans. As each year passes, new annual cohorts of eligible seniors become more tech savvy. As the market transitions online, eHealth\u2019s cost of acquisitions decreases. So what is eHealth worth? As briefly mentioned eHealth spends money upfront to acquire a new member for Insurance Companies, and throughout the life of the policy, the insurance companies pay eHealth in the form of commissions. In light of the business model, the key metrics the company uses for each business segment is: Approved Members - represents the number of individuals on submitted applications that were approved by the relevant insurance carrier for the identified product during the current period. Lifetime Value (LTV) \u2013 Estimated Monthly Commissions x Estimated Months the policy will be active Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) \u2013 Average cost to acquire a new member through different channels such as the ecommerce platform or through TV ads. Using the averages for these metrics from 2017 to 2020, I do the sum of the parts valuation below: \u200b Valuation, the stock has been trending upwards. Notable upward pricing movements have been caused by SEC filings revealing that some well -established activist value funds (Starboard Value and Hudson Executive Capital) have entered positions into EHTH. Then, on April 29, EHTH ended the day on $70 a share and released its Q1 earnings results after hours. It was overwhelmingly positive. EHTH outperformed and beat its top line and earnings estimates. So what happened on April 30th? The stock price started off strong and rose 10% to about $77 a share and then started cratering by 9:40, ending the day at $71 a share. \u200b Why? HIG Capital just so happens to finalize its $225 million investment of convertible stocks in EHTH on April 30th. See the filing date below: \u200b Reading the terms of the agreement, it looks beneficial for HIG to have EHTH\u2019s stock price be depressed until May 31st. The reason is because of the conversion terms. After May 31st, HIG gets to convert their investment of $225M preferred stock into equity based on the following formula: Shares of Equity = Accrued Value of Preferred Stock/Conversion Price Per the investment agreement, the conversion price is 125% X the Arithmetic Price Average for 120 days following January 29, 2021, subject to a max of $90 and a min of $50. So the lower the conversion price, the more shares of Equity they get. Conversely, the higher the conversion price, the less shares they get. Further evidence of this can be seen in abnormal trading volumes since the day of the earnings report: 4/30 9:35 \u2013 Volume 64.98k \u2013 Price $77\u2013 Money traded $5M \u200b 5/3 3:55 \u2013 Volume 33.55k\u2013 Price $67.25\u2013 Money traded $2.26M \u200b 5/4 3:55 \u2013 Volume 52.8k\u2013 Price $67.63\u2013 Money traded $3.57M \u200b 5/5 1:35 \u2013 Volume 53.37k \u2013 Price $66.55\u2013 Money traded $3.56M \u200b 5/5 3:45 \u2013 Volume 55.99k \u2013 Price $67.04\u2013 Money traded $3.75M \u200b 5/6 \u2013 Volume 16.83k\u2013 Price $65.72 \u2013 Money traded $1.1M \u200b I\u2019m speculating that it\u2019s HIG doing it because there\u2019s no other noticeable market participant that would want to push the stock price down. Additionally, I think it\u2019s only one party than a coordinate group of individuals all coincidentally pushing trades at the same time to cause several Millions of dollars\u2019 worth of EHTH stock to be traded at any given time. I mean, the amount of money from these trades is almost $20M. So what? Anyone buying shares would be able to buy shares of EHTH at artificially depressed prices. Furthermore, if enough demand pushes the price high enough, then it could push HIG's conversion price to increase, causing less of the value to be accretive to HIG and more to common equity. So if the stock price goes up, equity investors gains on two fronts! Risks: Investing has risks and you can lose money. From a fundamentals standpoint, EHTH: Might not be able to maintain or Increase its approved members or LTV Might not be able to maintain or decrease its CAC Might be affected negatively by other externalities such as regulation Additionally, HIG might be able to pull off a conversion that\u2019s value accretive from equity investors to them. Finally, my thesis on HIG is highly speculative and I could be completely off on this one. It really could be because there are other big investors that don't believe in EHTH anymore... Disclaimer: I may have made mistakes in my analysis or I might have missed information. You gotta do your own due diligence and make your own decisions. If you lose money, it\u2019s entirely your fault. FYI, I have call options in EHTH. Also, I\u2019m not a great proofreader so I might have typos\u2026 TLDR: Valued EHTH at more than $100 Speculating that HIG Capital is artificially pushing the stock price down because of its investment in preferred stock They want to keep the stock price depressed to they can convert for more equity shares and have more value accretive to them Because of their hanky-panky, we are presented with an attractive opportunity to buy the stock at depressed prices and potentially push the stock price up high enough that it\u2019s more value accretive to us than to HIG", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-07 16:21:54", "id": "n6r47x"}

Canada still has a low vax population so the good news for them will cause greater surges in airline stock prices.

This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves.

It\u2019s confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations.

{"text": "The case for BYND Improving fundamentals: It just received a double upgrade and now has two consecutive analyst upgrades. The total addressable market for BYND is potentially in the trillions of dollars: displacing animal-based beef, pork, eggs, cheese, and chicken. The World Economic Forum has argued that global meat consumption must fall within the coming years. According to Forbes, 60% of Gen Z is looking to base their diets on \u201cplant-forward\u201d foods. BYND market cap\u2019s only $10 billion. It\u2019s growing like a weed. Yearly revenue growth for the past three is 131% compounded annually. And BYND might have a durable competitive advantage. According to analyst Alexia Howard, for BYND, \u201cas plant-based products tend to be relatively complex to manufacture, moats could prove to be deep.\u201d Additionally, as of 2019, the company had one patent and 21 U.S. and international patent applications. It\u2019s attempting to achieve price parity with animal-based meat in the next few years and ultimately even produce for cheaper. As the first-mover, it also has the potential to achieve economies of scale faster and become most attractive from a price standpoint. Its competitor Impossible Burger has had to turn down partnerships because it hasn\u2019t had the infrastructure that BYND has and couldn\u2019t produce sufficient product to service big partnerships. BYND\u2019s further along and has been able to garner partnerships with the likes of KFC, McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks, Pepsi, Pizza Hut. Impossible Burger also produces its food with GMOs, which are outlawed in many countries. BYND already sells products in 80 countries. Remember that the GME run started in 2020 with not only high short interest but attractiveness from a fundamental perspective that led big investors like Michael Burry and Ryan Cohen to move in aggressively. BYND has this fundamental attractiveness more than a lot of companies with a high short interest, which analysts are largely downrating. BYND\u2019s growth took more of a pandemic-related hit than other food providers because much of its growth involves people buying their products in restaurants. It is, therefore, considered a re-opening play. BYND spends 7% of revenue on R&D, which is many times that of more mature food providers, so the future looks bright. High short interest: According to both MarketWatch and Ortex, BYND\u2019s short interest is higher than AMC, BB, and GME. Favorable externalities: Good against global warming, good for animals, good for global resources, good for human health. This gives incentives to many influentials (celebrities, governments) to encourage people to consume plant-based meat. Governments have subsidized the electric vehicle industry. Will they do the same for clean meat? Cramer has suggested BYND as a WSB play to his 250,000 viewers during each of his last three Mad Money episodes (Tues, Weds, Thurs; no show Fri) and elsewhere on CNBC. A couple people here have suggested Cramer has done so as a distraction. I understand the bitterness toward hedge funds: They\u2019re selling out, making a lot of money while not adding much to society. But Cramer\u2019s offering insight to nonprofessional investors to help them make investing decisions. I just started watching Cramer again about a month ago and just about everything he\u2019s liked most has moved up in value: Roblox, Ford, Wells Fargo. He has, in the past, consistently said favorable things about BYND and Ethan Brown. He\u2019s even suggested in the past that going against BYND is going against history. And anyway, the proof is in the pudding: BYND short interest is higher than AMC, BB, and GME, according to MarketWatch and Ortex. And it would be a lot nicer for a company displacing animal meat to sell stock and get more capital for R&D than a cell phone or a movie theater company. I was following the market in 2013, and this situation reminds me so much of Tesla in May 2013. The stock started rising on fundamentals, and commentators thought it was highly priced and thought it was rising only due to a short squeeze. But electric vehicles were the future and Tesla kept rising for years, even though there was concern that big players would get into the industry. Beyond Meat is also the future and has the potential to rise even after the short squeeze, which is one reason institutional investors may be buying. BYND\u2019s market cap of about $10 billion is also the same as Tesla\u2019s when its run started in 2013 and commentators were scoffing at its valuation. Now it\u2019s over $600 billion. This stock right now is potentially set up for a strong run within the next few months: increasing bullishness of institutional investors, high short interest, and maybe the increasing support of WSB. It\u2019s 40% below its all-time high. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it doubles in the next several months. Disclaimer: I\u2019m not in any other squeeze plays. I will probably write covered calls on AMC and hedge with puts because their short-term calls are very highly priced. (This is a delta-neutral position that should not impact AMC share price.) I have BYND calls and may buy more because their short-term calls are still cheap.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-31 12:54:08", "id": "noprc0"}
{"text": "First the easy quarterly comparisons are gone. It used to be pre covid numbers vs post covid numbers. If you're in AMZN or ZM or SHOP. You know what I mean Its been a year. They are gone. The comparisons are tough now. Second analysts estimates are catching up to reality. The earnings beats used to be huge! Jaw dropping really. But now they are quite modest. Still beats but just barely. Trades are crowded and position sizes are all overweighted. Today when earning are reported, beats don't move the stocks the way that they used to. Why? Because not only does everyone already own the stock, (no one left to buy it) they own way more of it than they should. Why? Because 1/2 the world was shut down by covid. The viable trades that remained became very crowded and over owned. Portfolio managers seeing difficult comparisons and modest earnings beats now are selling into strength to reduce exposure to over owned overexposed positions. Saas stocks and home shopping stocks are great examples. Terrific earnings terrible charts. Recovery stocks ran up BIG BIG BIG. But now as earnings are being reported we see that absolutely nothing is going on anywhere in recovery names. Hotels, airlines, Casinos. Zip zip zip. Nothing to see here folks move along. This certainly stifled new buys maybe even induced some selling. Where is the money going? Right now it looks like the money pulled is being parked in some select REITs and Utility stocks for brief periods. From there it is being scattered broadly into recovery names vertically. So if you like airlines as a recovery theme. You buy engine makers. Parts suppliers. ect all the way through the supply chains. You are trying to avoid crowded trades and seek value buys in soon to be recovering industries. This is a transition. The recovery has not been canceled.

They have this new drug called Anktiva could be a new cancer drug for a wide range of cancers. Not just one type but looks to be for mutliple types of cancers based on the study. Seems like the side-effects are minimal. Only downside I see from the study is that it's only a phase 2 trial of 140 patients so it's not as wide-ranging as a phase 3 study. Although, Anktiva got a 71% complete response rate (early remission) for bladder cancer patients in another phase 3 study. So FDA approval could be on the horizon since a phase 3 was done for bladder cancer. But apparently according to the phase 2 study, Anktiva also helps keep other cancers in check too. . Anktiva got a 68% durable disease control in a study for various cancers where patients failed previous checkpoint therapies (like Keytruda). Could be hope for those who have failed previous treatments for various solid tumors. If you know of anyone that has cancer and has failed or is failing treatment(s), I would call up IBRX and try to get in a study.

{"text": "The entire steel sector has been on a tear the past 12 months, with companies like US Steel moving from approximately $6 to $25, and I believe there is plenty of room left to run. Given that steel prices have been at all time highs, the steel producers have relatively low valuations, and other macro factors, the stock value for companies like US Steel could double or triple this year. High Steel Prices One of the reasons steel producers have flown under the radar and maintained low valuations has been analysts expectations that steel prices wouldn't achieve the levels they have and that they wouldn't stay at these high levels. See examples: [ and* [ However, prices have risen over the $1,000/ton peak that some analyst called for at the beginning of the year and touched above $1,600/ton his month. The price has pulled back a little to closing out at $1,505 on Friday. However, looking at forward contracts for steel, the price is not expected to fall below $1,000/ton until August 2022. To better understand how high the price of steel currently is, see the 10 year chart below: \u200b In 2018, X share price almost reached $50/share. Given where steel prices are now, I would expect it to touch that again. Low P/E The rise in steel prices have caused analysis to raise their earnings forecasts for the steel producers, but the stock prices do not appear to fully appreciate these earnings projections. For example, X is expected to earn approximately $7.95/share in 2021. At a current price of $25.5, X could earn 1/3 of its current share price in 1 year. China Is Curbing Production The largest steel producing country in the world is China. China's steel production growth over the last 15 years has been one of the main reasons for the demise of the US steel production industry. This is why I don't compare what X's steel price was in 2008 when steel prices were 1/2 of what they are today. Its just not the same company with China being the biggest player. However, China has started trying to curb its production with its new green initiative. [ Time will tell whether China keeps to its climate change goals and cuts its steel production, but if it does, then we can expect steel prices to remain elevated for a longer period of time. Spending Seems To Be Under Control One of the disappointments in the steel industry has been poor management. People who have been investing in X in the past remember Mario Longhi and the destruction he did to this company. Longhi cut spending when he shouldn't have, he rejected new technology upgrades to produce steel, and he was in charge while the company's intellectual property was stolen by Chinese companies who now produce steel at a much lower cost. Overall, Mr. Longhi's destruction caused the company to lose its top spot as a steel producer. X has a new CEO, David Burritt. Mr. Burritt seems to be doing a good job turning around the company. Instead of wasting money on money pits within the company, Mr. Burritt went out and acquired a new technologically advanced steel mill in Big River Steel. The timing of the Big River acquisition has played out to be a very well time investment as steel prices were close to their low at the time of acquisition and have tripled since then. Overall, the Big River acquisition shows that Mr. Burritt is willing to move away from outdated blast furnaces and into lower cost methods of making steel, which will help US Steel's future earnings. Tariffs and Potential Infrastructure Play As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, etc. It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support. The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated. In 2018, President Trump placed 25% tariffs on steel imported from China. Contrary to what some believe, Biden has made it clear that he is not interested in removing the steel tariffs placed on China. This should also help keep steel prices higher for longer. Conclusion Overall, for the reasons stated above, I believe X has the potential to climb 2x-3x within this year, if not more. There are other companies in this space that I will write my opinion on and explain why all are good investments. For example, Nucor ($NUE), which I also own, is best in class when it comes to steel producers. I believe NUE represents a great investment, but it has already doubled in the past 3 months. I think X has the most room to run and is worth your consideration.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-16 09:34:58", "id": "nda9rc"}

{"text": "by now you all should be sick to death of hearing about Palantir. shit stock, hype company, everyone knows this already. most of you barely understand what they do. some of you do understand, and root for the potential of the birth of yet another trillion dollar company, but that's not what I'm going to talk about. There is an aspect to all this that I have not yet seen discussed anywhere, and as soon as people figure it out, I suspect Palantir will see activity beyond anything anyone right now has predicted. Lets start by asking a question. If you had to create a company that was perfect in every way, that was untouchable by competition and greater than any company before it, one that would make google or amazon look like AMC by comparison, what would you need to do? first it would need to be a monopoly. no question there right? but a monopoly of what? There are currently 2 options that fit best and are also realistically achievable. those to things are information and energy. both will always exist, they will always be in high demand, they will never go out of style, and whoever finds a way to gain absolute control over one or both will effectively become the most wealthy person ever. 100 thousand years from now when humanity has transcended existence and all material wants we will still need information and energy. Palantir is attempting to monopolize information and to better understand why this is such a big deal, lets see what it would take to monopolize energy. the first and surprisingly easiest step, would be to create a viable source of free or almost free energy that you would then sell, probably through monthly payments, to the entire world. miniature thorium reactors, or breakthroughs in fusion technology could potentially do this. There is more to be done however... 1. In order for your business to last for centuries, your device needs to be impossible to recreate by anybody except your business and those associated with it. 2. it needs to be cheap, very cheap, and yet generate revenue regularly no matter the conditions or state of the world. 3. It needs to be constantly improved, or somehow protected from the possibility of someone creating an even better idea and putting your company out of business. assuming all these goals are met, you would now be the owner of a business that will always generate profit, that will always exist and bring value to customers, and that exists in a market that grows as humanity grows, meaning your potential is linked to the success and proliferation of humanity. With no possible competition, you would be the creator of the most successful company to ever exist. How now, could this be accomplished with information, and how far is Palantir from achieving these same goals? is their product impossible to recreate? is it cheap and consistent with revenue? Is it immune to any possibility of anyone catching up with something even better? Almost. not quite yet, but they are surprisingly close. \u200b 1. can their product be recreated? technically yes, but both Gotham and Foundry are seeing adoption by some very important organizations. Gotham is already joined at the hip with the United States government, and with continued proven effectiveness and Palantir's willingness to make deals with other countries, its pretty much guaranteed that Gotham will be seeing mass adoption into other countries as well. Like a really nice disease, eventually everyone aligned with the United States will use it. Foundry's the big fish here though. The real deal and the reason Palantir is on track with their goal of becoming the biggest software company in the world. That's not me saying that, they literally make that claim in their most recent earnings report. All businesses and people essentially have the same problem. Data is very valuable, probably one of the most inherently valuable things in existence. Don't believe me? take a look at your computer. data is just the transfer of information and a computer is simply a really big bundle of information and tricks to measure that information. A whole bunch of transistors turn on and off and through a massive amount of clever engineering and abstraction, all that data of whether or not something's on or off, 1 or 0, gets turned into your afternoon midget porn. this is an extreme example of how much value can be pulled from data no matter how unimportant or useless it may seem. 100 years ago nobody would have ever guessed that stringing a bunch of lights together and having them interact through rules determined by whether they are on or off would possibly lead to what we have today but here we are. Data has value. The problem that every business has is that they have all this data, but how exactly do you extract value from that? how do you extract the most value possible? everyone has their own solutions to these problems, but there is no unification to any of it. This is where Foundry comes in. Data that the Country or Business or person owns gets fed into Foundry, and everyone using it can assign specific rules to this data. This is a drastic oversimplification, but you frankly don't need to know the gritty details because they don't really matter here. All you need to know is that this oversimplification applies to computers as well. Computers are a massive collection of data, governed by rules where the result and potential uses are completely controlled by the person using the computer. There are plenty of questions here, how it works exactly, how private it is, what the use cases look like, and you can do this research on your own. What's interesting here is that while this product can definitely be recreated, its much much harder then it sounds and the fact that IBM and AWS have already given up and simply partnered with Palantir rather than try and recreate this technology just goes to show just how hard it would be to make a better Foundry or Gotham. However, assuming that everyone eventually starts using this tech, what would happen if something better came along? 2. Is Palantir's product immune to new and disruptive competition? The answer here is yes and absolutely. the REALLY neat thing about Foundry is that it essentially creates a perpetually self improving system. People input data and assign rules, but that data never disappears and those rules never change or are forgotten unless overruled by other more complex rules. this means that ANY new data added to the system is used to further improve the system. Again if you want more details do the research because I'm trying to talk to children here. I've been talking about data a lot but I feel I should stress the fact that your idea of what data is or can be is likely underdeveloped. did you poo today? what color was it? how soft was it? was it chunkey or smooth? how long were you on the toilet? can any of this info be used to determine what you ate? how healthy you are? what time did you poo? do you poo in cycles or does it come randomly? can any of this information help predict when you will poo again? maybe knowing these things can help you poo even better and more comfortably? This is all Data. All of it can be used, and all of it has value to be found. everything you see, do, feel, and think is data. The number of ways this data can be connected and utilized to better understand the world and yourself is potentially infinite. Therefore, a company that is able to create a product that can monopolize this potential could possibly grow even larger then one based on energy. a product that is perpetually self improving will never be outpaced by anything else ESPECUALLY if they get a head start which is exactly what Palantir has spent 17 years and billions of dollars of R&D on. 3. Is Palantir's product cheap and guaranteed to be profitably no matter the state of the world? I think it goes without saying that Software is the best business to be successful in. This is Unfortunately where Palantir is at their weakest currently, but as stated in their earnings report, they are hell bent on focusing on growth over everything else. First they bag huge companies with lotsa money, then medium ones, then small businesses, and finally everyday average people. Assuming company's continue to sign contracts, there will one day be a turning point where Palantir goes from a WSB name to a household one. you wont even notice it happen, it will just happen. As for profitability regardless of the state of the world, Covid has already proven that Palantir's services are in very high demand. \u200b On top of ALL this, Palantir is exclusively aligned with United States interests. Imagine if every country in the world used Palantir to some extent, and all that added value and power was exclusively controlled by the United States. There is an even bigger discussion to be had on the current technological race between the USA and China over who will perfect AI first, and the role Palantir will play in all this. The conclusion here is that whoever does win in the end, they will essentially decide the direction the world takes and how people in that world will live. This situation is very similar to the race between the U.S and Germany over who could invent the atomic bomb. luckily for us there's a lot less hot fiery death and a lot more new world order overshadowing the old one through the always watchful eyes of artificial intelligence. Elon musk is damn right to be afraid of AI, and If I had to pick one country to take it all I would like it to be the USA. This means that investing in Palantir is almost like betting on the United states in this all for one game. Make no mistake there is a very very good chance that whether or not you care about Palantir, your life is going to be affected by them one way or another. The moral of the story is buy the fucking dip and don't be a pussy about it. when you believe in a company enough it doesn't matter how much it dips because unless Karp and friends die in a fireball of death after boarding a small private jet to their mansions in Hawaii for a night of drug fueled indulgences, the future will always be bright. If you're unsure about Palantir still don't worry. They aren't going anywhere and there will be many many many more catalysts to fomo into and lose 50% of your portfolio on.

{"text": "Hello all This is not financial advise. Thank you to u/Goldendust. So we are using it as the absolute maximum number of shares held in the most extreme scenario. So The following table shows on the y-axis: ( \u200b On the x axis \u200b ( So for instance the most extreme scenario of shares held is 664 shares held by all 3.5 million people or 664 \\* 3500000 = 2,324,000,000 shares held by retail investors. The most extreme scenario of not held i 0 people engaged and 0 shares held so 0. Now both these are very unlikely but they are used to built the following table. So the table shows us what the amount of shares held in each scenario would be. \u200b All the red cells show scenarios of retail owning Less than 46,000,000 shares which is the float. All the yellow cells show scenarios where retail owns equal to or less than the Float x2. All the green cells show scenarios where retail owns equal or more than Float x3. Then we examine how those scenarios come out in data. \u200b So basically. there is a 59% probability in the calculation that retail owns more than Float x2. I believe this is why transparency is important. If one was to make a SEC filing over concerns regarding market manipulation, a accurate look into float ownership compared to reported SI% would be a good method for showing that there is something very wrong here. I am not arguing for cooperation in terms of trading. I am arguing that legitimate concerns should be raised and brought to the attention of the SEC. A report which accurately depicts ownership of more than 2x float would be irrefutable proof that somewhere in the system something is wrong. I understand that this is unlikely to happen as it would require a trusted member of various communities. I will now await downvotes and fud callers. This was just me playing around with data. I personally only hold 4 shares. Look forward to a hopefully civil debate.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-07 01:22:51", "id": "n68f1t"}

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument. Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us. All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\\` company doing good things (making money). We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;) \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 UWMC \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80Short Squeeze.Short borrow costs skyrocketed from 30% to over 93% in a few hours on Friday: They cannot keep shorting at this price. It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same. It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts. Stock BuyBack, Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th. Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool. Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic. Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each. \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 UWMC \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \\\\\ud83d\ude80UWMC is a good company, not just a memestock:\\\\UWMC is a good company that pays a good dividend, has a good CEO, and is the king of B2B mortgage refinance.

Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral. Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well. Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM. MIX IT UP!

Stop letting them take advantage, like they are right now, giving us a sense of false empowerment. Because that is what has happened, and they will torch all the stocks we think we control. So let\u2019s get back to the core of what made GameStop come to all of our attention, and that was the value investing tenets of Michael Burry and further championed by DFV. It doesn\u2019t have to be ViacomCBS. There are other deep value plays that are a discount from growing intrinsic value. But whatever you do, get back to their what GameStop was really about.

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There\u2019s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it\u2019s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim.

{"text": "1) UWMC - Some Techno Mumbo Jumbo Analysis, or reading the Horoscopes : wallstreetbets (reddit.com) 2) UWMC - Shorters have doubled down to manipulate the price in the Market : wallstreetbets (reddit.com)]( , there is no rule restricting what I did and I actually met the YOLO content guideline to appropriately post a YOLO. Nevertheless, I'm not actually mad about it. What i am a little annoyed by is that my post regarding the shorting in the pre-market of UWMC was removed, even though i provided a factual basis for everything there. Shorters borrowed 145,000 shares from IBKR in the pre-market, when volume was thin, to try to drive the price down and cover at market open after doing a stop loss raid. They wanted to do it in the pre-market, because under rule 10b UWMC can't do their buyback until the market opens. I caught it, and explained what was happening, but the post was removed. After the post was removed, at exactly 9:30, roughly 100k shares were covered. Please note this is in reverse order, and you can just see it yourself at Iborrow: 87.3 %150,000 2021-05-19 09:30:03 87.3 % 55,000 2021-05-19 09:15:03 87.3 % 55,00020 21-05-19 09:00:03 93.9 % 200,000 2021-05-18 16:45:03 Let's break down the numbers here. If a shorter borrowed 1M to borrow at a 93.7% rate, the calculation for what they'd pay that day would be: 1,000,000\\.937= 63,000. Then you divide by 365. That would cost the shorter 172.6$ to short it for the day. Now, the shorting activity caused the price to go down 3.59%. So 1,000,000\\1.0359=1,035,900. That nets you a profit of 35,900-172.6=$35,728 I'm sure people paper handed at a loss, because they got scared. Not many people are sophisticated investors, and to be blunt, not many sophisticated investors are actually sophisticated because the requirements to be labelled one don't actually apply to knowledge for the mots part. They don't know what goes on, and just look at a stock go green and FOMO in, and look at it go red and paper sell for a loss. As for the Technical Analysis, i guess I misflaired it as DD instead of Technical Analysis? I'd also like to make it clear regarding something. The \"I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise\" thing is a meme. Or i thought you guys were meming, but apparently i need to lay it out. The investment advisor act of 1940 sets forth the definition for an investment advisor. There are three requirements to be defined as an investment advisor (financial advisor). 1) You need to be paid, 2) to give financial advise, 3) regarding a security. So, for example, if I gave you advice as a financial coach regarding personal finance the SEC wouldn't care. I would only need to be licensed and required to have a fiduciary duty of care to you if I was a financial coach that was being compensated by you and told you you should buy Microsoft. Furthermore, you also don't need to register with the SEC as a financial advisor unless you have a certain amount of assets under management and that number is high. With that said, each state requires you to register with them, so there is that. \\-All- three of these conditions need to be met for the regulations concerning financial advice and licensure to come into effect and for the SEC to be able to \"nail\" you. Anyone offering DD is not being compensated by you, and thus, does not have a duty of care to you. Market manipulation is also not something that you need to be afraid of, provided that citations to well regarded publications are used, or you refer to GAAP, security filings (Think 8K, 10K's, 13F's etcetera). If someone is providing a stream of citations, like I like to do, I should not be flagged because i am reinforcing my point with objective data points. Anyways, some suggestions: 1) Reinforce/Update your ruleset and make points of clarification. 2) If you manually remove a post, post why (as Memetron did for my Yolo post), so that the individual can cure the defect and make his post compliant with the rules. If it was a bot, have the bot post the reason why. 3) Add moderators solely for the purpose of responding to modmail. I requested a reasoning as to why one of my posts was deleted three weeks ago, and it was never responded to. 4) Unironically, you should probably crowdfund so that one of you can go have a consultation with a Securities Attorney on behalf of this sub. Preferably one that was previously in the enforcement division of the SEC in a past life. Take notes on what he says, and you could even pay the individual to write you a content guideline that will act as a CYA, since you all obviously feel compelled to (even though you're not personally liable). Furthermore, you guys don't actually know much about what is and isn't allowable under the investment act of 34 & 40, and so honestly its probably best you get a crash course in securities regulation and a ruleset that appropriately accounts for securities regulations. This will probably not happen, but Wikipedia does it, so it's not a total lost cause.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-20 05:35:50", "id": "ngdffm"}
{"text": "Hello WSB, You might recognize me as the author of that shitty GME DD (that was taken down for \"hate violations\" rip old wsb) that never came true. Actually, I think there still may be truth to the post. Maybe HF's are hiding SI, maybe my initial date was off and we are still prime for a squeeze soon. \u200b \u200b \u200b But this post is not about gamestop. I am writing this post to answer a question that melvins bot asked me: How the actual fuck do you make money trading options and you don't know what \"writing a put\" means? \u200b \u200b Well I do know what writing a put means, but I believe the newbies of WSB would like to hear my answer. \u200b \u200b \u200b How do you make money in the stock market if you aren't a financial professional? The answer is simple: The Long/Short Portfolio \u200b \u200b \u200b What is Long/Short? The premise of a long/short portfolio is to be prepared for anything that could happen in the market. Even the best traders in the world can't guess and time every single economic event. The goal of the long/short is to have a portfolio set up that can make money in any market. The most basic long/short combination is SPY/VIX. If you compare the charts, they are pretty much exact inverses of each other. Because of this, you can protect yourself against a market crash. \u200b \u200b \u200b To give an example of how I use the SPY/VIX, I had spy investments that were up 25% around the 13th of april. My belief is that gamestop will squeeze soon, and when it does, the rest of the market will sell off. To act on this belief, I pulled most of my gains out of the spy and slightly increased my position in the VIX. This \"reaction\" can be triggered by your personal beliefs in the market, gamestop was just an example. If you only purchase the vix when it is near an all time low, and never purchase the spy at an all time high, you will have a foolproof hedge\\ Not to mention, the vix does not just pop on devastating market events. Normal corrections can be profited from through the vix. As you can see, this set up is made for protection. For example, if you were invested in the VIX and S&P before the covid crash, your vix investment would have increased just as much as your spy decreased. If you sold your vix, and waited a year, your spy would be back to it's previous value, and you would pocket the profit from the vix. \\Foolproof as in one investment will hedge the other. A 50/50 vix spy split will not be profitable. \u200b \u200b There are many ways to set up a long/short portfolio. SPY/VIX is the simplest, and probably the least profitable because it is created for this very reason. Perhaps an investor could find cyclical stocks that benefit from the others loss, and use that as a long/short. It's also possible to find cyclical stocks that are at a very low price, and hedge with more mainstream investments/tools, just like a certain DFV. It's ok to gamble on meme stocks as long as your portfolio has a long/short backbone. \u200b \u200b \u200b All in all, it is not possible to guess everything that will happen. So how do good traders make money even if they don't understand the exact intricacies and implications of options, or even economic functions in general? Long/short. They don't know everything. They just use the tools available to them to be prepared for everything. \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b Ok cool lots of talk about strategy but this is WSB and you're here for options. So how do you use long/short with options? Invest the exact same way a boomer would, but with leaps. What is the difference between parking your spare cash in S&P shares vs S&P leap calls for 2 years? If you are an active investor, there is no difference in risk. I would argue that through periodic vix investments, it is even less risky then letting your cash sit in shares. The benefit is that the return of the leap S&P options will return much more profit then the shares. \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b Disclaimer: I'm not responsible for any money you lose. And please, if you don't know options, research a lot before playing with them. From personal experience, it is very very easy to lose money. If you want to practice the long/short, use SPY/VIXY shares for a safer start. If you are new to investing in general, paper trade first. This is my own approach to the market. I am sharing it because I got my start in the market through WSB. This sub has cycles. It's normal for awhile, then a post hits the front page and there's a huge influx of noobs. Eventually, the words of the OGs get through to the noobs, and they learn the game. I think this new cycle has brought more newbies then the OGs can keep up with.

The first quarter of 2021 saw a substantial spike in retail trading activities, mainly caused by various short squeezes in stocks like GameStop (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Entertainment Holding. Google trends show the peak in search volume for terms like GameStop, Short Squeeze, and Day Trading in the last week of January. Especially the trading apps Robinhood and Webull saw a significant increase in app installs and new accounts. As a result, the payment for order flow income for Robinhood grew from $91 million in the first quarter of 2020 to $331 million in 2021. Webull had the most substantial percentage gain with $3 million in Q1/2020 to $46 million in Q1/2021. The payment for order flow split by broker for the first quarter of 2021 reveals that TD Ameritrade received most payments, followed by Robinhood and ETrade.

Earnings have consistently been improving, especially during pandemic times. Let's face facts, more and more people are starting to like weed. The pandemic put a lot of us in our homes with nothing better to do than to spark up every couple of hours. 2020 generally saw improved earnings for a lot of these companies as people began more actively using marijuana over things like alcohol. Personally, I think this trend is gonna continue. As a former dude who drank way the fuck too much, moving to an American state where weed is legal got me to transition from drinking to smoking or using edibles. While I still drink, it's very rare and I generally use weed because I can wake up the next morning and not feel like someone drove a train into my head. It's also been cheaper in the long run. I used to spend 40 bucks on good whiskey that would last me a week, sometimes a week and a half. Now, I spend 30 bucks on weed that lasts me two weeks. With the news that American legal sales recently hit all-time highs, I think we're going to see this trend continuing as people transition to more regular cannabis use. This increasing trend will only bolster what I mentioned in my last post about supply chains and marketable brands. Additionally, the Biden Admin is discussing cutting the amount of nicotine allowable in cigarettes in half. I believe that this type of action will trend towards cigarette smokers turning to marijuana instead. While I've not read any direct studies or anything on the matter, I've had three different friends who all used marijuana to help alleviate withdrawals from quitting smoking and then became regular cannabis users. While obviously the submarkets for alcohol and tobacco products will remain plenty strong, the push for American legalization is going to continue to leech consumers from those markets into the cannabis market. Increased social acceptability and turning from other \"sin products\" to marijuana are going to combine with the supply chains and branding advantages Canadian Cannabis already holds to create a power house when America fully legalizes. For the above reasons, I'm staying bullish af on companies like ACB, TLRY, etc. Edit: so this has gotten a little more attention than I ever expected. I only really planned the first of these two posts and this one was more impromptu this morning. That being said, it seems like some of you are actually interested in what my dumbass has to say. I'll probably put something else together when a few of these earnings go through. Obviously, this isn't financial advice and you probably shouldn't listen to my autistic bullshit, but for those interested, I'll keep it up. Now I gotta figure out what I'm gonna name the next one.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-09 23:03:51", "id": "n8cv8p"}
{"text": "I have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1 earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while competitors are lagged. During the Q4 2020 earnings call he had mused about options that would be on the stable, special dividend, buyback or raising the dividend. Feb Q4 Earnings Quote: The Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be paid on April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. We expect this to be a regular quarterly dividend. And so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet is a fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and we have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think about this going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're going to maybe be more profitable than some expected and be very successful in 2021. And if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much, we will be delivering that back. And whether we have to change the dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend, those things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares. May Q1 Earnings Quote: As you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special dividend or a share buyback program. As you guys have seen, we concluded share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward shareholders. We announced the authorization of $300 million share buyback over the next 24 months. And quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that. Then in answering a question from an analyst Doug Harter - Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you mentioned sort of the float. I guess just how are you thinking about kind of how much of the float you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share repurchase? Mat Ishbia - Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go because at this stock price, I'm a buyer, right? And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I think, as our legal teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know how many I can buy and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the float. If the float was not a concern, we'd be more aggressive. However, we have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm going to take advantage of that opportunity while being conscientious of our partners in the float. TL/DR: UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that it will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage. The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are not waiting, it's being deployed now.

{"text": "Full report: [ In short, they are still growing on most segments, the CEO does smart acquisitions (usually at a bit of a premium). \\--The Business-- Microsoft is a technology titan focused on commercial and industrial applications with software and solutions such as Office 365, Azure, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, Linkedin, Windows 10. They also provide platforms for developers via Visual Studio Code and Github. A smaller segment of Microsoft are their devices and their games division powered by Xbox. --Next Moves: Healthcare Applications-- The healthcare sector is characterized by massive bureaucracy and opportunities for growth. It is one of the rare sectors where real future growth is possible by innovation. Microsoft has established itself as a corporate and industry suite, but now it seems that they are taking their whole Eco-system and moving on the healthcare industry. This is pure speculation, but it can be one of the boldest moves yet, as healthcare facilities, operations, education, training, quality control are large complex systems that can benefit from the tools and services that the company offers. We have seen Microsoft positioning for a certain client type and taking over most of their business. As the opportunities for growth in the corporate sector decrease, Microsoft might just turn to one of the most complex industries with high barriers to entry and large upfront investment costs. On 11 April 2021 they entered into an agreement to acquire Nuance Communications for $ 56 per share, or $19.7 Billion. Nuance is a cloud and artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) software provider with healthcare and enterprise AI experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings. This is effectively their foot in the door to the healthcare industry. --Value-- I think that the company is trading around its intrinsic value, with potential for growth in the future. There is inflation related market risk that can push down value, but with proper management and pricing flexibility they can at least sustain current value levels. Microsoft solidified the cloud for the corporate & business sector, and decreased the risk of their sales by adopting a continuous subscription model for most of their services. Their business model seems to be growth trough innovation as they are positioning themselves precisely in segments where innovation is lacking and are integrating those segments within their high-barrier to entry, complex systems. \\--Product Breakdown-- AZURE: The backbone of the productivity suite for most of the western corporations Office: Stabilized revenues for essential business tools Windows 10: Declining bloatware built upon old architecture LinkedIn: Well positioned, profitable social network with long-term commuted users Dynamics/Viva: A major competitor for CRM/ERP market-share with potential for innovation PowerApps: The future tool for cutting operating expenses and bureaucracy for companies Devices: Uncertain potential for a better experience for Windows users. Augmented reality done right with industry application GitHub, VS Code: The platforms that will keep MSFT on the cutting edge of development tech Gaming/Xbox: Large but risky potential for growth if the devices and games are improved Microsoft has a wide and complex set of products and services which can be understood as cost cutting tools for businesses, system architecture utilities, productivity and effectiveness tools. They have created a well-thought off interconnected Eco-system that is nothing like the company was even five years ago. It is now apparent that they are well positioned as a market leader for industrial and business applications and will further solidify their position in the future. \\--Competition-- We are already witnessing the convergence of competitive advantages between the technology titans of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and it is clear that all of them are fighting for market share in similar technologies and industries. It seems that every company is fighting for their specific industry positioning within technology. For example, Facebook, Microsoft and Google all experiment with Virtual Reality tools such as Google Glass, Oculus Rift and the HoloLens Headset from Microsoft. However MSFT seems to be the most successful as it is positioning for industrial, military and hybrid workspace applications for the headset - the others had less luck in the consumer/gaming sector application of VR. Google, Amazon and Microsoft are likewise competing for cloud dominance, where Amazon AWS is positioning as a cost effective player for developers, MSFT is positioning as a stable and secure platform for companies and Google is positioning as an advanced cutting edge option for new technologies and companies that are able to scale. The last example is between MSFT and GOOGL where they competed for the use of virtual conference apps driven by the new hybrid work culture from the pandemic. Both of the competitors had a variant starting off, MSFT had Skype/Teams, and Google had Hangouts/Meet. It is evident that Microsoft had the right approach with Teams and took over the commercial sector for online communication. Side note, Skype is a drain on the Microsoft brand since the appearance of the pretend close feature. It is irredeemable and should be retired.

{"text": "\u200b Paysafe Partners, YouTube (Google), Twitch (AMZN), FanDuel (PDYPY), Roblox (RBLX), CoinBase (COIN), Visa (V), ApplePay (APPL), BetMGM (MGM), Spotify (SPOT), Microsoft/Xbox etc., and on top of that they got a huge digital wallet (#2 in market share) where you can trade/buy the fast-growing e-currencies which is growing in popularity. I truly believed this Paysafe is undervalued compared to its peers. You can read a very good Paysafe DD below on reddit and it gives a lot of insight of Paysafe valuation and bear cases: (the link above is a really really good read with lots of info about Paysafe valuation in-depth and discussion of bear cases, so I\u2019m not going to repeat most of the good points the author mentioned in that sub.) Most of the time analysis use assumptions to make predictions on future growth. As an example, EV-related stocks (PLUG, BLNK, QS, LAZR, NKLA, BLDP, etc) get higher or ridiculous valuation based on assumption that gasoline cars will eventually be phased out. As you can see most if not all of these companies are unprofitable and some don\u2019t even have revenue, yet worth billions. While this assumption may be accurate, it is extremely hard to know when will growth begin to accelerate. Because of this predictive nature, it\u2019s really hard to know how long you will have to hold onto the stocks before they pop. When or if it will pop is anyone's guess. So while holding onto these stocks will likely result in wild price swings thus high risk / high rewards. But what if you have the data before you showing the financial growth of your customers or partners? If your customers/partners' revenue grows, it\u2019s more likely than not they are using more of your products or services. Paysafe is one such company where you can actually look at their customers/partners' financial reports to predict where the company will go in the future and when growth will start. For this reason, Paysafe is more of a lower risk but still has high reward potential. Paysafe will be reporting earning for the very first time as a public company again on May 11. The good news is we already have their customers results in and here are some breakdown of their 1st QTR results showing huge growth: 1. PENN (Reported May 7, 2021) - \u201cPenn National\u2019s income from operations rose to $216.5 million in the first quarter against ($560.6) million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDAR jumped 77.2% from the year-ago quarter to $447 million. Moreover, adjusted EBITDAR margin expanded to 35.1% from 22.6% a year ago.\u201d ( source: [ ) 2. DraftKing ( Reported May 7, 2021) - \u201cDraftKings is raising its fiscal year 2021 revenue guidance from a range of $900 million to $1 billion to a range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, which equates to year-over-year growth of 63% to 79% and a 16% increase compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance\u201d Source: [ ) 3. Spotify (April 28th, 2021)- \u201cRevenue increased 16% to \u20ac2.15 billion ($2.6 billion) from \u20ac1.85 billion ($2.22 billion) in the same period last year\u2026.\u201d (source: [ 4. Youtube/Google ( April 27th, 2021 ) - \u201c In its first-quarter earnings report Tuesday, Google parent company [Alphabet 5. Skillz ( May 4, 2021 ) - \u201cRevenue grew to $83.7 million during the first quarter of 2021, up 92% over the prior year. Gross profit grew to $79.4 million during the first quarter of 2021, up 95% over the prior year.\u201d (source: [ ) As you can see these Paysafe\u2019s customers/partners are reporting explosive growth. While some of these companies may report an earning loss it may be due to higher expenses such as customers acquisition cost (i.e. Draftking). However, here we are more focused on their revenue as the more transactions they do the more likely all or part of that transaction is done by Paysafe. These companies reported earnings before Paysafe, so it can be highly expected Paysafe will report a very good earning and future growth projection tomorrow ( May 11). Several things to note about Paysafe besides their customer\u2019s earning growth. These factors will also influence Paysafe\u2019s future growth: 1. They are a monopoly when it comes to iGaming/Sport Betting as you can see the explosive growth by DKNG, MGM, PENN, SKLZ, etc. 2. Paysafe took a hit during the pandemic because they also do offline transaction processing, but now things are opening up we can expect going forward these offline transactions will grow again. Also, when re-opening occur, more sport events will occur thus more betting means more transactions for Paysafe. 3. They are #2 in digital wallets and you can buy digital \"stuff\" with the wallet. These currencies has been generating huge revenue for PayPal and SQ on their 1st qtr report (more on this below) Finally, both PayPal and SQ reported earning before Paysafe and their results beat estimation: Paypal earning ( May 5, 2021) \u201c Revenue: $6.03 billion vs. $5.90 billion expected by Refinitiv\u201d (source: [ ) Square earning ( May 6, 2021 ) \u201cSquare reported a profit of 41 cents per share vs. 16 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts. It also brought in $5.06 billion of revenue vs. $3.36 billion expected by Refinitiv.\u201d ( source: [ So I can say with confidence Paysafe will likely beat their own guidance for Q1 on May 11th. For those of you who don\u2019t know Paysafe, they are not a small player. Their transaction volume is about that of SQ \\~$100 Billion. I get it, people will say look man their CAGR is way too small compare to PayPal or SQ. I'm not looking at the past. I'm looking at the future. Their CAGR estimate did not include the sportbetting/igaming growth. Remember that Sportbetting was banned in the USA but has been overturned by the SCOTUS recently. Right now less than 1/2 the population can bet online, and the 4 largest states haven't yet legalized online gaming. This is why I post the results from their customers like DKNG and PENN which is showing high growth rate. And best of all? They own this space in online gambling as they are a monopoly. So we'll see what their new CAGR will be going forward once they reported earning tomorrow (May 11). If Paysafe is able to show growth on par with PayPal and SQ they should be trading at a much higher multiple. See the reddit link above for DD on valuation. Paysafe involved with Gaming, Sports, e-wallet/currencies which I find very exciting and feel that if I own the stock I\u2019ll be part of the journey of growth with these sectors. Roaring Kitty/ DeepFuckingValue simply invested in GME because he liked the stock. I\u2019m investing in Paysafe simply because it's cool and sexy, regardless of its growth potential. Summary: Paysafe I believed is a lower risk and high reward stock, since their growth is easier to predict as we can rely on their publicly traded customers data which is showing high growth going forward. They got the 2nd largest digital wallet. I believe as a monopoly in iGaming/Sport Betting their growth will be massive when 20+ states including the 4 largest states: CA, TX, NY, FL begin to allow online sport betting. This is something about Paysafe that I like so much because no other fintech has this space. This is a massive high growth (as seen with DKNG, PENN, MGM 1st qtr report) area and they owns it. For these reason, I am extremely bullish and I like Paysafe for both short and longer term play. Disclaimer: I own Paysafe commons, warrants, and option calls. I am not a financial adviser.

{"text": "So I may or may not have been smoking weed when this idea came to me, but I was sober when I bought 4K in options for these space etfs. I had the revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. Increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth. And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth. I really liked this idea and did more DD when I sobered up. My first thought was that if the government doesn\u2019t release the report then I\u2019m fucked. But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing. As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago. As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence. All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist. But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things. Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology. If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose. And if people think it\u2019s another country then we will rush to match the technology. These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way. Many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.

That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue. In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up.

{"text": "Here I would like to first summarize 2 important news with sources then on the latest part of my post summarize my imho : 1- What\u2019s happening silver in lbma ? In early April, LBMA claimed that total silver held in LBMA London vaults had risen by a massive 11% during March from 1.125 bn ozs (34,996 tonnes) to 1.249 bn ozs (38,859 tonnes). This, it turns out, was not true, as the real end of March figure was 1.143 bn (35,557 tonnes). Please you see the source as follow; Important part of the statement ; We publish vault holdings data as part of our continued efforts to improve transparency in the Loco London Precious Metals Market, which also includes reporting weekly LBMA Trade Data. The statistics below include the holdings of the London commercial vaults as well as the Bank of England\u2019s gold holdings (the Bank does not hold any silver). Latest Gold and Stocks in London Vaults A data submission error led to the publication of an incorrect aggregate figure for the total silver held in London vaults in March. The corrected figure is 1,143,194 Troy ounces ('000s). 2- what\u2019s happening in physical market ; A global shortage of physical gold and silver products has created a premium on coins and bars, and this premium is causing a disconnect between the spot price and the \"true\" price that retail investors need to pay, said Ed Moy, former director of the U.S. Mint. Premiums on these physical gold and silver products can run as high as 20% in some places, Moy said. One of the main reasons for why the spot prices have not caught up to gold and silver's premium-adjusted price is that the overall markets are flooded with bullion derivatives, Moy said, but it's only a matter of time before the short contracts keeping the price down expire. Source : there is really fundamentally big changes in silver market . THE INVESTMENT OF THE DECADE The silver market is one of the most toxic of all. Heavily manipulated and with bullion banks now being 700million oz of silver short on Comex and with no liquidity in London, as Alasdair Macleod has pointed out. Still, even if not in the next week or two, silver will win this game in the medium and long term as the dosage of paper silver shorts is much too big to survive a short squeeze. I would not be surprised to see the 1980 and 2011 $50 high to be taken out in 2021.( my imho ) ( not financial advice I am just ape like you )", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-11 08:40:58", "id": "n9gwjt"}

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill. Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had. If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there. Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it. Issues I've had with them Margin approval is like pulling teeth. They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications). If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again. That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them. I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k. I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.

Desktop platform \"StreetSmart\" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste. They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about. $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account. They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some \"very rare\" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure. I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing. Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.

{"text": "Little ape-friendly DD on CRSR if you haven't been paying attention. The stock is surging today...finally.... after an unexpectedly awesome earnings call yesterday. I've held a position since October (got in at one of the $40+ peaks), and have been bleeding ever since. The time has finally come for liftoff. The stock is probably one of the safest undervalue plays on the market right now, and the ship is just setting sale. Here's what you need to know. Well-established company within one of the hottest retail industries in the world. The stock IPO'd last September, and immediately surged from $17 to $50+ on great Q3 2020 earnings (fueled by the pandemic gaming surge) CRSR has been making some excellent acquisitions, most notably Elgato, establishing market dominance in the streaming space. After falling from peak, the price bounced up and down between $35-$45ish leading up to the Q4 earnings release. Despite good Q4 numbers, the short interest surged, and the price tanked post-earnings in February. Even with excellent fundamentals, the stock became a prime target for swing/day traders. Short interest stayed high. It was viciously attacked by bears spreading all kinds of bs FUD. Many were trying to spread rumors that video games were a fad that only took off due to the pandemic, so the company's performance was a fluke. Others were spreading fear about the share lockup period expiration, which had the potential to release a few million more shares onto the market. Others were spreading concerns about CRSR not being able to fulfill inventory due to the semiconductor shortage. None of that FUD has come to fruition. The stock continued to trade sideways, often swinging +/- 3% every day. Swing traders & shorts took advantage of the low volume and relatively low float. Q1 2021 earnings showed sales figures that nearly matched holiday season 2020, and record net income. Proving that sales have not been hindered by the pandemic waning in the US or the semiconductor shortage. Just about every fundamental has been improving every quarter. Sales are up, income margin is way up, Cash is up, Debt is down, * LOGI's market cap is currently trading at more than 6X CRSR. But this quarter, LOGI's Net Sales were less than 3X higher. Both are trading below industry avg P/E Ratio Most importantly, unlike other bubble-fied tech stocks, there was NO price runup to yesterday's earnings release. The beat was not priced in at all. The stock is currently completely undervalued by just about every metric. Today, volume has been higher than it's been in months managing to break out of the sideways cycle....there is A LOT of room to run. This stock is easily undervalued by 45% or more right now.

{"text": "Intro There have been many posts recently about VIAC, and for good reason. The stock is chronically undervalued. There have already been some posts that have gone very in depth about the fundamentals of VIAC that I read after I had a position in the stock, but are nonetheless very enlightening: ( If you look at the charts VIAC just keeps bouncing around that $40 range, and that resistance is most likely caused by whales who didn't sell fast enough to cut their losses. These whales have hit this resistance multiple times, and the dam is weakening. There seems to be no viable explanation other than this as to why VIAC has not gained at least a marginal amount, it simply defies logic. I made this post not to convince you that VIAC is undervalued or anything like that, if you can't see that you should stop trading now because this is as blatant as it gets.

When looking at the short position 6-7% and the large number of Call options outstanding, would a price movement push a short squeeze ? I believe AMD is COILED to rebound, it needs a trigger. The trigger is the combination of 1. Short positions : 83M as of April 15th 2. CALL options above 78 strike expiring in May, June, July. 1,018,166 contracts = 100M shares. Net of Put options 65M. AMD institutional ownership is 78% of the float 1.2B shares \\*78% = 950M Float is is 250M. What if : 1. EVERY shareholder put A LIMIT SELL ORDER for $1000 for every share you own. To remove the ability of brokers to short sell or borrow the shares to fill call options. 2. Buy more shares and repeat step 1 3. Buy Call options. The demand will increase the price, the limit sell orders will limit the supply. The price is pushed down, as hedge funds sold a lot more call options than put options and they will loose a lot of money if the price goes higher than 78.5. The bulk of the contracts are between 80-120 strike. If you consider options till the end of the year, the number is more than double that.

What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best.

Overall, UWMC actually has had consistently higher net income margin than RKT, currently sitting at 68% vs. 58% for RKT. UWMC's focus on wholesaling and working entirely with brokers makes it much easier for it to pivot to home purchase originations, which Freddie Mac actually predicts will grow 16% by 2022. Home purchases are more complex than refinances and the value of using a broker shines in those cases. In fact, UWMC is already more heavy on home purchases than its competitors.

{"text": "So y'all have been asking for an easy, can't-possibly-fuck-it-up type of trade, especially after the $ISRG debacle. I don't usually like writing up about companies with more than half-trillion dollar market caps, but I'll make an exception just this once because it doesn't get any easier than this trade, especially with our newfound policy of kissing China's feet rather than trying to piss them off. So let's talk about Alibaba ($BABA) # Who they are, in case you've been living under a rock $BABA is basically the result of if you combined $AMZN, $JPM, $SHOP, $PYPL, and $GOOG (not $GOOGL, no voting rights in China). Over 90% of China's online shopping goes through one of their portals, mostly Taobao on the consumer side and the flagship Alibaba site for B2B. Oh, and they've even started building out their own cloud platform, because China can never just come up with an idea on their own, they have to copy a competitor (i.e. Amazon). If you think Amazon is pervasive, they're bush league compared to this company. In short, the only thing bigger than China's $BABA is deceased WWF pornstar Chyna's clit (still too soon?). Anecdotally, they're also where savvy US consumers go to buy $1500 DJI Phantom 4 drones for like 400 bucks (and no, they're not knockoffs). \u200b # Peering over the Great Wall: \u200b Their over 600 billion dollar market cap makes them the 7th largest company on the exchange, just behind $TSLA and just above Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger. Unlike the company just ahead of them, they actually make money, though. They do about 72 billion dollars in revenue annually and, when they're not pissing off the communist party and being handed down massive fines as an alternative to their founder being disappeared to go hang out with the Uyghurs in a slave camp making textiles, they pocket about 12 billion of that 72 as net revenue. They make their money by selling ad space to merchants as opposed to $AMZN's method of \"taking 1/3 of all the money you make for giving you a buy button on the site\" and, as recently as 2019, had grand designs about moving in to the US space and taking on $AMZN head-on with a merchant agreement of a one-time admission fee in exchange for commission free commerce. I could write an entire thesis just on their various revenue streams. Everything from ecommerce to a search engine to their own fucking (DUMB FILTER ALERT: automod doesn't like the 4 letter word for a place you go to deposit your money and get checks so we'll call them) tanking ecosystem (which they unsuccessfully tried to spin off into its own entity last year, thoroughly pissing off Winnie the Pooh and momentarily distracting him from peaceably seizing Hong Kong by killing all the citizens there. Interestingly, as a result of their mini argument with the technocommunist leadership over a failed attempt to IPO the Ant Financial Group, which $BABA owns 1/3 of, $BABA represents one of the few large cap stocks you can trade in the US that isn't presently sitting near an all-time high (20% off, in fact), as people - including myself - avoided the company while waiting to see what China was going to do with them. Then others have been apprehensive to jump back into because, apparently, it's more fun to lose all your money betting on a shitty Chamath scam that rips off Medicare or a LIDAR company down 97% from its ATH and who makes less gross revenue in a quarter than I paid for my last car (tragically, I'm not even joking). As a result of this depressed price action, $BABA represents something of a unique animal on Wall Street: An ultra cap growth stock that is also technically a value stock. Just don't tell them they're a unique animal or else the citizenry will storm their headquarters looking to kill everyone and eat them because they think it'll bring them luck or make their dicks bigger. I usually stay away from this statistic, but for once it's actually worthwhile to mention: They only trade at 26 times forward earnings. In case you were wondering, $AMZN is more than 3 times that. \u200b # So what's their problem? \u200b I've already said: It's China as a whole. All Chinese companies trade at a discount in America for a number of reasons. The primary reason is because you can never tell if a company is actually being honest about its books, its revenues, or if it's even a company. For example, longtime followers will know that I have maintained for quite some time that I'm not positive that the company \"Same Ole Shit\" is even a real company. Why? Because there's no oversight. Also, there's no shorting over there, so everybody gets away with making shit up. One of the largest companies on their exchange was found to be 2 guys in a van that parked behind a hand-pulled noodle shop and who's sum assets were 2 laptops and some web development software. This is why, in general, I don't fuck with any Chinese stocks and only make exceptions for $BABA, $BIDU, and $NIO (and I'd do $YUMC if not for the fact I ignore that whole sector). But mostly, it's because if the regulators across the pond took aim at $BABA once, there's always a chance they could do it again if Jack Ma forgets his place. The 2.8 billion dollar fine they got handed down sounds really heavy, but it was really a best case scenario for this company. Had that fine been handed down during any other time than now when the market is in hard mode, $BABA likely would already be sitting in the 280's right now. # So how does the Tendieman come? Expected 47% YOY growth, with strong forward guidance going in to 2022. Also, now that President Harris is making nice nice simping for China again, as soon as we re-open, expect them to start the process of moving in to the US market, which will both simultaneously decimate Amazon's 3rd party network while bolstering $BABA's own. Oh, and they're encroaching upon Lazada's turf throughout the rest of SE Asia, as well. But there's a catch: Because Jack had to go to a re-education camp for a few months and the company was forced to lay low waiting for Poohbear to finish throwing his temper tantrum, there's still a bit of a fog into the company right now that is not likely to be cleared up until they report their next earnings late May. Don't worry, I have it on good authority that $BABA's network of merchants has been able to secure a reliable supply of child labor to continue making all the goods they sell. \u200b # Some basic TravelCenters of America just because (even though it's not terribly important for the thesis) So this one is going to look a little different than what I usually put up, cause I figure some of you are ready for some more advanced concepts. \u200b As always, nude line is a 200 day SMA, dark blue is a 50 day SMA, and cyan is a 20 day EMA. Red lines represent the wedge that's important for all of you for the purposes of understanding that it's approaching a breakout point that is almost 100% to the upside, green represents some channels that we'll talk about some other time, and the lavender is a bastard fib fan of strike points based on the action (typically you use those in a slightly different manner, but that's for another day and another time. I'm going to start gradually adding Travelcenters of America markers in an effort to grow your little minds a bit. So consider this a level up. \u200b TL:DR: Look in the red wedge. We're coming up to a head in that pattern, and it will be right around the time they report earnings. Look at all the other pretty colors and see if a wrinkle doesn't develop. One other thing we can look at is price to fair value. This is a Morningstar chart, I didn't make it myself. \u200b \u200b \u200b So there are a couple of things I want to call out here. One is, obviously, the fact that this stock is wildly undervalued according to every reasonable metric. The other one is a term that I want you guys to start learning called \"Economic Moat\". The smoothbrain definition of that is basically a company's ability to lie, cheat, sabotage, or buy out any competition in order to ensure that they maintain a competitive advantage, no matter what. Wide moats are good but rather rare. Obviously, if you read the \"who are these people\" section, you know that $BABA has perhaps the widest moat of any company on earth, because not only are they alone, but the barrier of entry to challenge them is enormous. Just ask their main competition, $JD, who takes 1 step forward and 8 steps back every time they try. # So, to summarize: Absolute monster of a company 20% off its highs because of a combination of government interference, continued concern over regulatory fuckery, and the fact that nobody trusts the books of a Chinese company Over 90% of their market is penetrated, and they have aggressive expansion plans abroad Presently at a value level today as a result of them still being fairly fresh out of their hand slap for the shit they pulled I expect some DJI drones sent to my PO box after you make tendies on this * Reports late May; is very much a 2nd half of the year play - don't expect a ton of movement in May up until earnings. But volatility is already low. # Price Targets: For once, I actually agree with pretty much every analyst out there. This company should be in the 320-330 range, and I think as we enter the 2nd half of the year, you'll see a strong climb toward that. \u200b # How do you play it? LEAPS ONLY! If you look at the daily chart, it had a bit of a pop after they got fined, but has been largely flat money lately as nobody has wanted to exit out of their positions due to it being undervalued, but not a lot of demand to get IN to the position due to the overall market conditions as a whole. July at the earliest, August if you have the powder to pay the extra premium. If you look back up at my chart, I've gone with a peanut butter spread strategy with this one, buying calls at $260, $270, $280, and $310 (now do those lines make sense?) one month apart from one another starting in August and running through November, along with some existing June 18 240's just because I felt like it. Remember, it's perfectly fine to let this one sit a bit before entering into a position, but your cost basis will be roughly the same, regardless. At the time of this writing, it's sitting at 235. If you look at the chart above, there's a real good chance you can creep in some positions after it hits 230, because at some point I think it will come in to that number. However, if it drives to 230 hard, I want you to let it consolidate and see if you can't get it even lower - maybe even 224 if you can catch it on a really bloody red day. But don't fuck around too much, this isn't a lot of slippage given the equity price. One thing people have been asking me periodically is how I would rank the companies I've talked about thus far on the premise that they don't have enough powder to be in all the plays and were looking to see if I would abandon one play for another. I don't want to encourage that overall (I don't want to encourage messaging me at all, really), but this once I'll say that I would definitely not give up my $CLNE or $BE trades for this one yet, as I don't expect this one to move for a while and those green plays represent significantly more upside. I wouldn't give up the $NVTA trade if I was way underwater on it. If I wasn't, I might consider it. I'd definitely give up cruise ships and plane engines. Semis in June would be a personal choice. I'd bail on the Devil's Gold companies I talk about, I'd bail on $BB, and the other trades are kind of dead, anyways. \u200b # Position Disclaimers: Some of you may have seen me talking about how I'm rebalancing my portfolio for May and exiting out of all but 15 of my long positions in preparation to enter into 35 short positions due to market conditions and timing. $BABA is one of the 15 stocks I do plan on holding my longs on. Liquidity in August has been difficult for me to get, so I'm only sitting on 200 of those, the September 270 is really where I think the sweet spot is and I've presently got 1900 of them and will be looking to expand that, I have 2500 October 280's and the November 310 is a long term FD that I'm sitting on 700 of. I also have a significant amount of shares in the company, but I've had them since their IPO and they are sitting in managed assets, so not relevant to this trade. There you have it, kids. Go forth, and tendie-ize. All my love \\-Chad Dickens \u200b Post-script: Really? Fucking REALLY?

{"text": "TL,DR at bottom. *\\A Couple Disclosures\\ 1. I'm kind of an idiot. 2. I only lose money when I invest. 3. $UWMC is the first company I went YOLO on... so that says everything you need to know about me as an investor. 4. This doesn't discuss their earnings. Here we we go: Cyclical vs. Growth: Cyclical companies are companies that are commonly referred to as \"value\" companies. This means they trade at relatively low P/E ratios in comparison to growth companies. Sound familiar? This is because their TAM (Total Addressable Market) is well defined and fluctuates with the economy or other macro conditions outside of the companies control. Cyclical companies will trade at low P/E's in boom conditions and higher P/E's in slow-down conditions. A natural outcome of investors understanding of what is causing the growth and decline in earnings. $UWMC is in a cyclical industry. Mortgages are a mature market that is defined by the economy and interest rates. UWMC has no control of either. It just went through the best macro environment \\ever\\ for refi's and 77% of its revenue is directly tied to this incredibly rate sensitive product. This is why its P/E is so low right now and may even trend lower. But is $UWMC a cyclical stock? I'll revisit later. Interest Rates: As mentioned above, $UWMC just went through the best revenue opportunity ever presented by the Fed. There is still a large refi market available but math tells us as rates stay low or raise it will dry up quickly. As interest rates rise that might shrink the mortgage market and offset any potential gains from the loans being worth more. Unless rates continue to trend lower, this will create a significant headwind to $UWMC's earnings. SPAC: It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money. Short Interest: Fixation on short interest seems dumb to me. If you invested in $UWMC in hopes of catching a short squeeze... you should hop out now. If you have made it this far, perhaps you understand there are perfectly logical reasons for $UWMC to trade so cheaply in regards to P/E. I don't think a conspiracy theory about price manipulation is the \\most logical\\* conclusion but.. maybe? So why invest in $UWMC? What's above is kind of my bearish information on $UWMC. These are the reasons I invested in the stock: 1. Founder(ish): Mat Ishbia is the #1 reason to invest in this company. Do you trust him? Do you consider him a talented and driven executive? Can he make good, long-term decisions to grow the company and the brand? To me, the answer is yes. There are a lot of threats facing $UWMC particularly and every company generally. Mat is a guy who has taken a company from 15 to 8,000. Do I expect that trend to stop here? No, I don't. There may be some bumps but I consider him a talented executive and a winner. He may have to pivot the company into other loan products like RKT has, but hopefully he will navigate that well. He just can't let the company stagnate. He has a track record to prove he'll grow responsibility and consistently. 2. Brokerage Channel: Is the brokerage channel the best way to get a mortgage? Can $UWMC grow the channel AND their strength in that channel? Can they educate consumers about the best way to get a mortgage? To me, the answer is yes. I had a Rocket Mortgage and hate them as a company. They call incessantly. Talk down to you when you don't take their advice. Rarely friendly and only helpful in origination. I tried to refi with them anyway just cause I thought it would be easy. Ended up going with an independent loan officer who educated me on the process and was a dream to work with. The loan officer saved me $4k and tailored a solution to me needs that Rocket COULDN't have done. Remember, the mortgage market is mature so the only way to get a higher P/E from the market is to take market share. This isn't a \"rising tide lifts all boats trade\". For $UWMC to grow market cap it has to shrink RKT, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo's mortgage market share. 3. Publicity: One reason that Mat went public was a marketing move. He gets to tell investors about how the brokerage channel is the fastest, cheapest and best way to get a mortgage. Does this hit revenue in the long term? Does this help $UWMC increase mortgage market share? To me, the answer is yes. 4. Growth: This is the summation of my first three points. $UWMC is trading as a cyclical stock, but perhaps it is a growth stock. I'm investing because I do believe it will overtake RKT as the #1 mortgage provider in America. As it shows in earnings over time that it is increasing market share the stock market will reward it with a higher P/E. 5. Dividend: I don't go out of my way to find a dividend stock, but $UWMC does some unique to me in that it can pay a high dividend on Class A shares while not messing up the balance sheet. It is currently at 5.8% which is plenty. I'm just hoping for a modest bump every year in dividend pay. No specials please. TL;DR $UWMC is trading as a cyclical company but may prove to the stock market to be a growth company. We are investing on the brokerage channel and Mat Ishbia to pull market share away from the other top mortgage originators. This is the only way to grow market cap as the TAM of refi and originations will almost assuredly decrease in the next few years.

{"text": "Return of Big Oil. The stories of Oils death have been exaggerated. I dont know if the previous post made it to WSB. Been lurking here for awhile posting comments here and there. Here is the link to my previous post. TLDR: Still have my calls however I sold some at the top in March and bought more since then. Fully levered to specifically OXY and XOM. XOM Calls: 171 $80 calls for 1/21/22 63 $75 calls for 1/21/22 87 $70 calls for 1/21/22 22 $60 calls for 1/21/22 OXY Calls: 21 $40 calls for 1/20/23 Now for some details. As of yesterday we got our first clear indication that the reflation trade is on like donkey kong. The API estimate for supplies for oil were a huge draw in inventory. This has been slowly building with other investment banks earlier this year saying that oil production is in a major deficit and will significantly effect the price per BBL later in this year. As of right now we have Goldman Sachs at $80 by this fall ( JPM at $75 by this fall, Morgan Stanley at $60 for the year but $75 this fall, and other major investment banks that have gone balls deep in betting on the oil price environment. So clearly, they see something coming this year that hasnt accurately been priced in to the energy sector through the share price. (Ignoring the small cap energy names and talking about the large caps and Majors IE XOM, CVX, PXD, OXY, FANG, EOG, MRO and maybe you would look at ConocoPhillips..) This brings me to my next point, all those companies have told investors that the plan to keep production flat to return money to shareholders. That means that if demand returns to pre-Covid levels in the near term we will have a significant supply deficit on our hands. Now lets look at the EIA data (next data dump from them is later today around 10:30 CST.) Here is the general link for the EIA Gasoline Supply ( ) Key takeaways from this is that Gasoline demand is up and continuing to increase, additionally, the EIA reported on their outlook for the summer driving season and they estimated that the price of gasoline would increase alongside with the increase in driving that we might see due to pandemic being handled. Specifically, the Biden Administration has set July 4th as the date for true reopening assuming we can get enough people vaccinated. I see this as a key date to watch. People seem restless after being locked up all year and want to take a vacation especially since the prices of vacations are cheaper and most families having the most liquidity that they have ever had on record. Now that seems to be a pretty rosy outlook for gasoline demand and trucking diesel has already surpassed last year precovid levels back in March. So that means travel and transportationa are up. Now lets look at air travel which would add more demand to the supply chain. As you can see in the link EIA shows that we are moving in an upward direction in air travel but I would expect this to slowly keep rebounding this year while coming back to the original usage next year. Now lets look at production, something that is heavily debated amongst oil bulls/bears. EIA has revised their production estimates 3 times this year downward because of lack of capital going to replace the production. That 8% drop from 2020 to the previous estimate was a shock to some but now the EIA predicts that the US will produce 10.9 MMBPD which some think is a stretch due to the amount of drilling required to bring production to a level that we were at in 2020 and 2019. The US has been slowly adding rigs to keep drilling new HZ wells that will help keep the production flat however, due to the extreme decline curve of HZ wells (they decline about 67% in the first year) both the amount of wells being drilled and completed will need to dramatically increase to meet the demand. Roughly speaking it will take an operator about 20 days to drill a well to total depth and completion according to SM at the beginning of the year however they are one of the fastest drilling and completion teams in the Permain Basin. SLIDE 14 Also something to consider is the fact that most operators now drill and complete wells in large groups nicknamed the \"Cube\" (for SM its about 8 but some go so far as 36 at once.) So wells drilled in this style would take between 160-720 days. (Now for a less aggressive estimate we can assume that some companies complete multiple wells together and this is known as Simulfrac which would cut the completion time in half for large groups. For sake of optimism lets just say 80-360 days. This means wells that are drilled now wont be online to keep production flat until about fall at the earliest and next year at the latest. All this info is to setup the big kicker. With our boi J-POW printing like no ones business and Oil being priced in dollars across the world we can also get some weird inflationary pressure due to the dollar getting weaker. Alongside with the interest rates coming higher and investors flocking to safer boomer dividend stocks. That is why I took agressive bets on XOM. This is the biggest boomer of all. They are incredible about producing around the world, refining, and getting great prices for their products. OXY's bet is for a separate post but it boils down to this being a company that might be too indebted to survive unless they get $65 oil which as of yesterday we are there. They have torque to the oil and gas market and should be able to pay down debt thus making them financially solvent and increasing the share price. Hold on to your bootstraps boys. This year is going to be wild for Oil and Gas companies. There are a couple of risks to this theory but with the API information and IRAN posting a video about blowing up congress it looks like Repubs are going to want to get tough on Iran and not sign a new deal. That leaves roughly 2MMBOPD off the market. Venezuela just decreased production to 500mBOPD which is terrible considering the size of their reserves. My case actually still works for this year even if both Iran and OPEC+ start pumping due to the demand rebound that will cause a terrific spike in prices. This is my own opinion and I am probably retarded so dont take anything as fact but I think its setting pretty nicely.. GLHF.

{"text": "*\\TL;DR at the bottom So first let me get some things straight. I\u2019m not saying this could become another GME, but if it reaches even 10% of the GME potential then we might have a really good play here. \u200b Chamath* is one of the big investors in this stock. CLOV was made public through one of his SPAC\u2019S. I know lots of apes hate him, sure he should have diamond-handed GME. But should that be the reason not to buy CLOV? His track record is incredible nonetheless! A little more about the investment Chamath made! Short-term-wise, he can\u2019t pull out his investment as he did with $SPCE because his lock-up expires in July 2021. I have to say that he wouldn\u2019t jeopardize his reputations if he thought Clover was a scam and didn\u2019t see the potentials. \u200b Vivek Garipalli is the co-founder and CEO of Clover Health. Prior to founding CLOV, he founded CarePoint Health in 2008, a fully integrated healthcare system in New Jersey. He owns 83.5m shares in CLOV which is classified as class B shares which are looked until the price reached $30 for a period of 90 consecutive days. In his early days he worked as a Healthcare Investment Banker at Credit Suisse, he also has worked at Blackstone Group and JPMorgan Partners. \u200b What is Clover Health? Well, it\u2019s an insurance company providing cheaper solutions for customers, but with a focus on the individual. In their own words: \u201cClover\u2019s Medicare Advantage plans are built on technology from the ground-up. Integrating our systems with doctors, clinicians, and nurse practitioners, Clover\u2019s data team helps healthcare professionals in the field intervene directly into patients\u2019 wellness to help them avoid acute health episodes.\u201d \u200b The development of this software is led by Andrew Toy the President and Chief Technology Officer at CLOV and a former Product Director from Google, working with things such as Develop Platforms, Develop Ecosystems and AI/Machine Intelligence. \u200b What\u2019s the difference between Clover health and Original Medicare? Original Medicare covers some of the costs of hospitals and doctor visits but does not cover prescription drugs or vision, dental, or hearing care. It can have high copays and coinsurance, which can lead to high costs if a beneficiary needs to go to the hospital. Clover\u2019s Medicare Advantage PPO plan covers hospitals and doctor visits like Original Medicare, as well as prescription coverage and additional benefits aimed at keeping members healthy \u2013 all at a low cost and on an open network. \u200b Besides being an insurance company, CLOV also seeks to develop the industry\u2019s best, most well-informed, and useful physician assistant tool to empower its partners to deliver better primary care to Clover members. They focus on PCPs because they are the trusted quarterback of each member\u2019s care that have the most significant impact on their care journeys. Arming them with relevant patient information and data-driven insights empowers them to take better care of Clover\u2019s members. \u200b \u200b Now to the fun part, the numbers! \u200b Public Float: 109M; The biggest 3 combined owns 33M shares (Vanguard 26.1M, Black Rock \u2013 2M, Baillie Gifford & Co\u2013 5M: They are either mutual fund & long-term, so it is highly unlikely they will sell in short term. This also makes it way harder for short sellers to fully cover their short positions as they would need a lot of shares which is locked up in these mutual funds. Revenue: In 2020 they made $672.9m with a net loss of $92.7m and $462.3m in 2019 with a net loss of $181.5m. Revenue grew 46% from 2019 to 2020! Guidance for 2021 is $820-850m that\u2019s a YoY growth of \\~24.1%. They expect to be fully profitable in 2023, pretty impressive! Compared to the average 8-9% growth YoY in the medical insurance sector CLOV is doing way better! EBITDA may not be sexy, but they can easily beat EPS for sure. They will flush $44.8M gain on derivatives in Q1 (officially published), which can shoot up net income. Also, they flushed all the unnecessary expenses/losses in Q4 (i.e. I-P-O-C and CLOV Merger legal costs, etc\u2026. In Q1, 2020, they had a loss of 28M. So this one-time boost on derivatives in Q1 will beat the EPS estimate (at least for Q1). Also, they said they will increase their guidance - per the linked publication. \u200b \u200b Option Interest on Calls: 601,034 (multiply by 100, which is 60M) - Gamma Squeeze. (Total) 350k of those expire in May. The options table looks ideal for a potential gamma squeeze, have a look in the picture below. As you can see there\u2019s lots of open interest for almost every strike! Short sellers and the total call OI is around 107m shares if all calls become ITM. This would literally make it impossible for naked call sellers and short sellers to cover their position because of the low public float of 109m shares! \u200b \u200b Short interest: As of Friday the SI% of the float was 43.48% or 47m shares sold short. (source: S3 partners) This is quite a lot, actually the top 3 most shorted US stocks! The funny thing about this is that the price went up close to 5% even though shorties added another 2m shares to their short position. The SI% of float has gone up almost every day to keep the price down! However, HF\u2019s are digging their own graves by doing that! \u200b \u200b Total call OI and shorted shares are almost the same as the entire public float. Keep in mind that out of the public float of 109m, around 33m of those is locked up within the top 3 biggest investors. Bringing the actual free float down to 76m shares. This would make it nearly impossible for the short sellers to cover the 47.7m shares they shorted. \u200b \u200b Short-Term Q1 Earning Call (Positive Catalyst - Facts) \\- 58,040 enrollment as of Dec 2020 increased to 66,395 enrollment as of April 2021 (they released earlier in April). So far, this increased 14% compared to the prior year (i.e. their revenue is also expected to increase by 14% from $166M in Dec to $189M in Mar 2021. Note that their annual guidance is 68K \u2013 70K, so we are already halfway there meeting the target, excluding the CMS contract in 10 states (that opens the door up to 200,000, which was already approved and started on April 1) There was an email from Andrew (IR guy), he said that he will release at the right time (Quiet period until ER, so I would assume this will be released on ER. If not, when is Andrew ever going to release this positive news officially. \u200b \\- As of today there are 117 open job positions on Clover Health's website! Definitely a sign of growth \\- Lowering the age of Medicare to 60 from 65 would add another 23m Americans to the TAM. In money that equals around $250b more! This would definitely help CLOV expand further. \u200b \u200b In 2021, the Government would open the MA enrollment period for the whole year, so you can expect more people to enroll throughout 2021. - April 1, 2021 \u2013 Clover issued an 8-K statement to correct loss on derivative from $(51.1) million to $(6.3) million. This is a one-time adjustment that occurred after Dec 31, so this will get flushed as an adjustment in Q1. This is material because considering their budgeted M-C-R of 92.6%, Q1 profit is expected to be $13M (based on high-level calculations). This adjustment is 4 times that of profit/loss, so it will boost profits substantially in Q1 and the outlook of YTD 2021. (Note \u2013 if you are a long-term investor, you shouldn\u2019t care too much about this because this is just paper profit. But, because analysts\u2019 price target is based on the bottom line DCF, this will substantially boost their price target, further increase the price target). So, in Q1, Clover Health is expected to be in a net profit position Q1 instead of loss, which is impressive for a start-up. \u200b So if everything sounds so great why is the stock price 50% down from Dec/Jan highs? Well, there\u2019s a couple of reason why. \u200b Money flowing out of Growth stocks and SPACS Manipulation from short sellers (Very high SI) Hindenburg short report, down below is a further explanation to this report. \u200b The short report by Hindenburg covers some issues regarding a DOJ investigation and points out the losses over the year. There\u2019s some more minor stuff besides this. The DOJ investigation looks to have been sorted out, they will probably announce something regarding this in the upcoming ER. The losses Hindenburg is pointing out are to be expected for a newly started company, and in my eyes, this is nothing to worry about as the company states they will be profitable in the fiscal year 2023. In fact, they already cut losses in half from 2019 to 2020, while generating 46% more revenue, impressive. \u200b After the short report by Hindenburg short-sellers beat the crap out of CLOV \u200b CLOV responded to this in a long report, and the CEO Vivek Garipall went on a phone call with Forbes saying: \u200b \u201cThere is no more real person than I am about this shit,\u201d he contended, casting himself as an honest broker in a \u201cfucked up\u201d healthcare market during a meandering phone call. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care, like, publish whatever. But don\u2019t publish stuff without people like us being able to comment and tell you what we think.\u201d \u200b This is a CEO that would do anything for his company, his shares are even locked up until the price reaches $30 for a period of 90 days! Next week, when they release short interest info from NASDAQ (Tues AH), May MA enrollments and earnings (May 17, PM), and options expiry date on May 21\u2026 can you feel something big and positive will come in the next few weeks? I sure as hell can! \u200b Macro-wise, NASDAQ had a little correction this week (today\u2019s job report sort of kicked rotation from value to growth). Also, hopefully, after Elon\u2019s SNL this weekend, that crypt-o capital will gradually flow into the stock market, especially already beat-up small/medium growth stocks with WSB \u201cshort & gamma squeeze\u201d candidate). \u200b Bearish case: Increasing competition in the space Legacy companies VS CLOV From 46% YoY growth to \\~24% guidance growth for 2021 (however this is really early still, we would need q1 to see updates on this, may surprise?) Potential Nasdaq correction \u200b Bonus info: Alphabet (Google) backed CLOV with a $500m investment. Walmart and CLOV recently made a partnership. Demetrios Kouzoukas joins BOD. \u200b Analyst ratings: Citigroup buy with a PT of $19 Credit Suisse neutral with a PT of $10 JP Morgan neutral with a PT of $15 So right now we are trading below all analyst ratings. \u200b TL;DR: CLOV is currently below its NAV and even further away from the average PT set by analysts.This is a company with huge success and a bright future ahead of it, in one of the hottest sectors under the Democrats! The potential downside is very low, as we are already near the bottom. \u200b My price predictions. If we get a little gamma squeeze I see this go to around $40-60 If we get a full-blown gamma squeeze combined with a short squeeze I could see this go to $75+ Without a gamma squeeze I see this at $15-30 before May 21st. Please do your own DD before investing, I\u2019m not a financial adviser. And this is not financial advice.

{"text": "The aim of this article is to sum up all the relevant DueDiligence of the company giving a fair StockPrice estimation. After discussing the value of each drug in the pipeline, we come to the conclusion that BCRX should be valued at $180. If you are looking for some extensive and detailed DD on the company, this is the article you're looking for, and I highly suggest you keep reading it. In case you find the given information useful, I encourage you to support the article in order to reach more people and rise awareness of how undervalued BCRX is. Before starting to read the article, my suggestion is to focus more on Orladeyo and BCX9930, since both of them are the most valuable assests of the company at the moment. If you want to learn more about the company check out u/bio9999 oral pill \u200b Orladeyo is the first Oral approved treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with hereditary angioedema (HAE)*, disease which is estimated to affect 1 in 50,000 people \u200b \\- Orladeyo was firstly approved in the USA December the 3rd, 2020. Q4 \\- Orladeyo received Japan NHI price listing approval April the 14th, 2021. Q2 \\- Orladeyo received Europe approval April the 30th, 2021 Q2 \\- Orladeyo received UK approval May the 12th, 2021 Q2 \u200b CEO himself Jon Stonehouse confirmed in the last conference call, ( 22:15 ): I think in the past you've talked about sales potential for Orladeyo of 500 million plus, are you still reiterating that target? \\- Stonehouse ( CEO ): Yeah make sure you remember the plus. \u200b Orladeyo is ranked, Physicians expect to Prescribe Orladeyo for over 40% of HAE Patients. \u200b \u200b 4.1.1 Pricings/Revenue \u200b USA In the USA there currently are 10,000 patients, 7500 diagnosed and treated, 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed. Physicians expect to prescribe Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients ( the diagnosed and treated ones ) out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over 41% of patients prescription we would conservatively aim for 3,075 patients. The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to 485,000$ \u200b Japan On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals. A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it. Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to at least reach 500 patients. The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to $248,500 Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a $15MM milestone payment from Torii. BioCryst will receive tiered royalties ranging from 20% - 40% of Japanese sales. \u200b Europe It's estimated to be around 12,000 HAE patients in Europe. Following the physician prescription of over 41% of patients to prescribe for Orladeyo. We get a total of 4,920 patients in Europe. Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's $248,500/year. This number should soon be confirmed. With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results. \u200b \\- USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$ \\- Japan - 500p x 248,5K = 124,250,000$ \\- EU - 4,920p x 248,5K = 1,222,620,000$ \u200b Summing it all up we get $2,751,270,000. From that number we have to subtract 123,100,000$ making it a total of $2,628,170,000. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma. \u200b 4.1.2 Q1 EarningsReport Beat \u200b On May the 6th, 2021 BCRX presented Q1 Earnings Report data which managed to Beat Analysts estimates. Basically what matters from this Q1 ER is that it was the launch of Orladeyo, and Analysts wanted to see a decent amount of money generated by it. They were expecting Orladeyo sales to top $3.1MM and Orladeyo actually generated $10.94MM, this is a 353% sales beat The consequence of the ER beat was an increase of 24.06% in the SP \u200b It's important to mention that revenues generated this Q1 only came from the USA. This Q2 Orladeyo has been approved in Japan/Europe/UK aswell, adding new sources of revenue. Orladeyo sales are expected to grow exponentially each quarter. Main reason for it is that it has been approved in the countries mentioned above. The other reason is that the amount of patients they treat will slowly score up as insurance companies allow their clients to be treated with this drug. \u200b 4.1.3 Orladeyo value Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating $2,628,170,000 a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier x7. We get a total of $18,397,190,000 meaning an increase of $104,46 in the stock price. \u200b Orladeyo value: 104,46$ SP* Peramivir (Rapivab) is an antiviral drug for the treatment of influenza. Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells. It is approved for intravenous administration. On 19 December 2014, the FDA approved Peramivir to treat influenza infection in adults. Peramivir has also been approved in Japan and South Korea and is available in Japan as Rapiacta and in South Korea as Peramiflu. The U.S. government (department of Health and Human Services) gave BioCryst Pharmaceuticals more than $77 million to finish the Phase III clinical development of peramivir. In 2009 the department of Health and Human Services had already given about $180 million to the program. In 2013 the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA/HHS) released new funding under the current $234.8 million contract to enable completion of a New Drug Application filing for intravenous (IV) peramivir. \u200b 4.2.1 Peramivir value With all the explanations given above and having in mind Peramivir is a government bio-defense drug the value of Rapivab can not be less than $500,000,000 conservatively speaking. \u200b Peramivir value: $2,84 SP is a broad-spectrum antiviral in advanced development for the treatment of viruses that pose a threat to health and national security, including SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika. The NIAID and BARDA have been funding the development and testing of Galidesivir for over 15 years as they recognize its importance in preparation for all future pandemics. The 31st of August, 2020 NIAID Awarded $44 Million Contract to Advance Development of Galidesivir. Galidesivir has also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity in vitro against more than 20 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses in nine different families, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses and flaviviruses. (Hepatitis C, West Nile, Dengue, Jap Encephalitis, Yellow Fever, TBEV, OHFV, and Zika), orthomyxoviruses and picornaviruses.. Galidesivir is the first antiviral that has ever shown such potential, and to top it off, it is now known from the Phase I trial and now the Brazil part 1 trial to clearly be safe and show dose-sensitive effects in people. And based on multiple animal studies, it works equally effectively as a pill that is stable for years at room temperature. Not only that, but this antiviral, unlike any of the others, has excellent penetration of the blood brain barrier as was seen in the macaque Zika virus study. \u200b 4.3.1 Efficacy Galidesivir was safe and generally well tolerated in Phase 1 clinical safety and pharmacokinetics trials by both intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy subjects. In animal studies, galidesivir has demonstrated survival benefits against a variety of serious pathogens, including Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika viruses. The company on December 22nd announced that all three doses were perfectly safe for the patients. In addition, they found that patients had a dose-sensitive reduction in virus levels in their lungs. They went on to say that an animal model, showed that Galidesivir significantly reduced COVID-19-associated lung damage. \u200b 4.3.2 Galidesivir value We must have in mind that Galidesivir is a Government funded bio-defense drug, that aims to treat a wide range of viruses as explained before. Its global stockpiling for future pandemics is also an absolute certainty given its long-term stability. With all the given explanations, conservatively talking Galidesivir can not be worth less than $1B this is 5,67$. \u200b Galidesivir value: 5,67$ SP. HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. Patients with FOP become bound by this irregular ossification over time, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. There are currently no approved treatments for FOP. There are an estimated 3,500 to 9,000 patients worldwide, with 900 diagnosed so far. Currently there aren\u2019t any approved treatments. Market size for this treatment is estimated to reach 500M-900M in 2025, growing to 3B in 2028 as more patients are diagnosed. With a price ranging from $900K-$1M/year. Last December the 21st Biocryst announced positive Phase 1 results \u201cBCX9250 was safe and well tolerated at all doses studied, with linear and dose-proportional exposure supporting once-daily dosing.\u201d. \u201cIn preclinical studies, BCX9250 demonstrated potency for the target kinase, selectivity, safety and strong suppression of HO in animal models.\u201d \u200b 4.4.1 BCX9250 Value BCX9250 study will most likely take 4 years to finish, this is, until 2025. By then the potential market we will be aimming for, will be $750,000,000 aprox. Drugs that are in Phase 1 studies are said to have a 10% chance of making it to the market. Following that, BCX9250 as of now shuld be valued at $75,000,000 = 0.43$ \u200b BCX9250 value: 0.43$ SP granted Fast Track designation for oral Factor D inhibitor, BCX9930. This is how Bill Sheridan ( Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President ) defined BCX9930 in the last conference call ( 22:00 ) as of now, that's why insiders call it \u201cPipeline in a molecule\u201d. Those 8 diseases are shown in the pic below. \u200b 1- PNH (Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria) 2 - aHUS (Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome) 3 - ANCA vasculitis (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis) 4 - Lupus Nephritis 5 - IgAN vasculitis 6 - C3G (Glomerulonephritis) 7 - PMN (Primary membranous nephropathy) 8 - IgAN (IgA nephropathy) \u200b 4.5.5 Potential market size by 2025 Assuming BCX9930 will be approved by 2025, and it will be able to treat the previously mentioned 8 diseases, we reach to the following conclusion. The potential market size BCX9930 will be aiming for by 2025 scores up to $28,56B - $51B / year. This numbers are explained below, stating the yearly market size each of those 8 diseases aim for. \u200b 1 - 2 \" Due to COVID-19, the market for PNH and aHUS was anticipated to grow from US$ 4855 million in 2020 to US$ 7023 million by 2026; it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.89% during 2021\u20132026.\" 3 - \u201c Anca vasculitis prevalence in the USA rounds 10-20 per million = 3300-6600 patients. As a treatment example we use Soliris, which costs $500,000/year. We would aim for 1,65B - 3.3B market size as of now. Expected to grow by 2025\" 4 - \u201c\" The global systemic lupus erythematosus market size is expected to reach USD 3.08 billion by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc., exhibiting a CAGR of 7.0% during the forecast period. \" 5 - 8 \u201c\"IgAN. The gathered disease prevalence data varies according to in which coutry the study has been undergone. Data gathered from the undergone study in East Asia, show the prevalence rounds 45 / million. meaning 14,850 patients, or a potential 7,25B market size using Soliris's yearly price \" 6 - \"C3G: Prevalence in the USA round 14-140 per 1M people = 4620-46,200 patients. If those patients were to be treated with Soliris which costs $500,000 / year, the potential market size we aim for rounds 2,31B - 23,1B \" 7 - \" PMN prevalence is similar to the one of IgAN, so we would potentially aim for a similar market size, meaning 7.25B\" \u200b 4.5.6 Alexion buy out On December the 12th, 2020 Alexion announced that AstraZeneca was going to buy them out for 39B. More than 90% of their revenue come from their \u201c\"\"Factor D\"\"\u201d C5 inhibitor, being that the main reason why AstraZeneca wanted that buy out to happen. You might think, why does this matter? Well, remember we have a Factor D which has shown to be more effective than Alexion\u2019s, and is able to treat more diseases than they do aswell. This buy out reflects how undervalued BCX9930 is. Apart from the buy out, I think it's essential to mention that Alexion bought Achillion's \"Factor D\" when it was in Ph2 for $930MM. In 2019 Alexion's SOLIRIS\u00ae (eculizumab) net product sales were $3,946.4 million. Soliris is currently approved to treat PNH and aHUS. Have in mind BCX9930 is able to treat 8 diseases, aiming for a wider market, while having greater efficacy/safety profile. As a quick example, using the average biotech mid-cap x7 revenue multiplier, and the revenue Soliris managed to generate in 2019, 3,964B = 27,748B. It would mean a SP value of $157.56 for BCRX. I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in-class treatment and it's able to treat more diseases, therefore aims for a bigger revenue opportunity. \u200b 4.5.7 Soliris/Ultomoris patients survey BCRX recently did a survey with 23 patients, 12 of them using Ultomiris and the other 11 Soliris. The survey showed that 91% of the patients were interested in switching due to the reasons explained in the pic below. \u200b Some of the patients treated with BCX9930 were asked some questions, among them, the 6th one expressed his desire to be able to be treated with BCX9930 oral pill. As we have seen it before with Orladeyo, patients are highly willing to switch from needles to oral-pill form treatments. \u200b \u200b 4.5.8 BCX9930 From a Ph1 to a Ph3 \u200b On March 22, 2021 BCX9930 PNH Ph1 data was shown, the obtained results were so good that it enabled BCX9930 jump from a Ph1 to a pivotal Ph3 trial in PNH\\\\\\, totally skipping the Ph2.\\\\\\ Additional proof of concept BCX9930 Ph2 trials in Renal Complement-Mediated diseases will be made. Straight jumping from a ph1 to a pivotal ph3 trial, is something that's not common in the bio world and could be taken as a really bullish sign. Apart from it being a bullish sign, it accelerates the process of development of the drug, giving it a chance to hit the market in a smaller span of ti \u200b 4.5.9 BCX9930 valuation Having in mind BCX9930 is a potential best-in-class treatment, that Alexion got bought out for 39B mainly for their \u201cFactor D\u201d c5 inhibitor, and the yearly market size BCX9930 aims for in 2025 rounds the $28,56B - $51B mark. BCX9930 valuation can not be less than a 30% of Alexion\u2019s buy out price, this is 11.7B meaning 66.44$. \u200b BCX9930 value: 66.44$ SP as of October 30th, 2020. Stating how they believe BCRX will have a strong revenue growth in the incoming years.** \u200b \u200b \u200b 6. Alexion's performance with Soliris As we have explained before, Alexion Pharmaceuticals has its own \"\"\"\"Factor D\"\"\"\" C5 inhibitor inhibitor called Soliris. Alexion could be the perfect example to have an idea of what we could expect from Biocryst's in the incoming years. From 2007 to 2014 Alexion's stock price grew a 1777%. Being valued at 10.5$ in 2007 and 186.6$ in 2014. Revenue generated by Alexion gradually grew up as their Factor D was approved to treat additional diseases, and the market size it captured became wider. \u200b Biocryst Pharmaceuticals managing to do the SP move Alexion did, is more than doable with the unique pipeline it possess. Having in mind Alexion made 66.4 MM revenue the first year while BCRX expects to generate 500 MM plus with Orladeyo, apart from it, additional revenue generated by Rapivab/Galidesivir stockpillings may come. Incoming Earning Reports are meant to be potential catalysts for the company, gradually becoming more meaningful as the market size they capture with Orladeyo becomes wider. \u200b 7. De-risked company Last December the 7th, 2020 BCRX announced they made a Royalty agreement with Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management. With this agreement BCRX was funded with $325,000,000 in order to support Orladeyo launch. Setting the company in an attractive position of not needing to do any money rising \"Offering\". Jon Stonehouse CEO, also confirmed that the company will not need to do offerings anymore. The fact that the company is already generating revenue with Orladeyo is another strong evidence that confirms money risings will not be needed anymore. It's important to restate that as part of the Royalty agreement, Royalty Pharma will receive a 1% on global net sales of BCX9930, if approved. Showing how bullish they are on BCX9930 and their willingness to invest at it. \u200b \u200b 8. Forward looking statements \u200b 1. From now on EarningReports should be catalysts and positive for the company, obtaining better results each quarter as the company settles down and receives additional approvals for Orladeyo in different countries. 2. Orladeyo European launch. 3. The company will have to provide some colour on the BCX9930 PNH pivotal trial, how it will be planned etc etc... Aswell as the PH2 trials in complement-mediated diseases. 4. BCX9250 Next steps should soon be shared by the company 5. BCX4430 Galidesivir recently completed a Ph1, additional information about the study may be given. It's important to mention that this study was fully funded by the NIAID. 6. Galidesivir/Rapivab stockpilling. \u200b From now on revenues/BCX9930 updates are the main catalysts. \u200b 9. Conclusion After this exhaustive analysis, we come to the conclusion that BCRX is severely undervalued, and if we sum up the true value of the pipeline, it should be valued around 180$. The StockPrice fair value number will keep growing as we keep getting data updates from the on-going studies and Orladeyo revenues keep growing, making it an excellent long-term hold and buy out candidate.* I currently do have a position in this company, my average entry price being around the 4$ range. My initial plan is to hold the shares for the long term, at least 2 years more provided that we don't get bought out earlier. I expect the StockPrice to keep rising as Orladeyo revenues flow in and BCX9930 trials keep progressing, aswell as the rest of the pipeline.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-28 06:42:53", "id": "nmfr14"}

Yellen, and now Powell, maintained this approach. All three of Powell\u2019s predecessors claimed that the asset prices they helped inflate in turn aided the economy through the wealth effect. Which effect we all admit is real. But all three avoided claiming credit for the ensuing market breaks that inevitably followed: the equity bust of 2000 and the housing bust of 2008, each replete with the accompanying anti-wealth effect that came when we least needed it, exaggerating the already guaranteed weakness in the economy.

Nor, in 2008, did it stop U.S. housing prices declining all the way back to trend and below \u2013 which in turn guaranteed first, a shocking loss of over eight trillion dollars of perceived value in housing; second, an ensuing weakness in the economy; and third, a broad rise in risk premia and a broad decline in global asset prices (see Exhibit 1).

It\u2019s a classic precursor of the ultimate break; together with stocks rising, not for their fundamentals, but simply because they are rising. > >... > >So, here we are again. I expect once again for my bubble call to meet my modest definition of success: at some future date, whenever that may be, it will have paid for you to have ducked from midsummer of 2020. But few professional or individual investors will have been able to have ducked. The combination of timing uncertainty and rapidly accelerating regret on the part of clients means that the career and business risk of fighting the bubble is too great for large commercial enterprises. They can never put their full weight behind bearish advice even if the P/E goes to 65x as it did in Japan. The nearest any of these giant institutions have ever come to offering fully bearish advice in a bubble was UBS in 1999, whose position was nearly identical to ours at GMO. That is to say, somewhere between brave and foolhardy. Luckily for us though, they changed their tack and converted to a fully invested growth stock recommendation at UBS Brinson and its subsidiary, Phillips & Drew, in February 2000, just before the market peak. This took out the 800-pound gorilla that would otherwise have taken most of the rewards for stubborn contrariness. So, don't wait for the Goldmans and Morgan Stanleys to become bearish: it can never happen. For them it is a horribly non-commercial bet. Perhaps it is for anyone. Profitable and risk-reducing for the clients, yes, but commercially impractical for advisors. Their best policy is clear and simple: always be extremely bullish. It is good for business and intellectually undemanding. It is appealing to most investors who much prefer optimism to realistic appraisal, as witnessed so vividly with COVID. And when it all ends, you will as a persistent bull have overwhelming company. This is why you have always had bullish advice in a bubble and always will. \u200b Of course, the million tendie question is when? My advice? Just keep hedging. \u200b positions: UVXY 5c 5/14 SRTY 12c 8/20 SDOW 9c 9/17 SQQQ 15c 9/15 \u200b TLDR: People like to ignore warnings when it's inconvenient to abide and/or due to social pressure. This is not a post to talk you into going bear - this is just a post to remind and encourage you to practice risk management and to always properly hedge.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-12 23:31:55", "id": "nanjgi"}
{"text": "First, I am a licensed life and health agent that does about 70% of my business in the Medicare space including Medicare supplements, Medicare Advantage and Prescription Drug plans. I'm appointed to sell multiple companies in multiple states in the Midwest US. I DO NOT own ANY healthcare stocks, so I don't have a dog in this fight. I only learned what $CLOV did yesterday after seeing posted all over WSB. My intention is to let you know that $CLOV is a bad play. TLDR at the bottom as well as sources. Graphs along the way. Enjoy :) General information about Medicare directly from cms.gov: # Medicare Program - General Information ### Medicare is a health insurance program for: ^(People age 65 or older.) ^(People under age 65 with certain disabilities.) * ^(People of all ages with End-Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant).) ### Medicare has different parts that help cover specific services: Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) - Part A helps cover inpatient care in hospitals, including critical access hospitals, and skilled nursing facilities (not custodial or long-term care). It also helps cover hospice care and some home health care. Beneficiaries must meet certain conditions to get these benefits. Most people don't pay a premium for Part A because they or a spouse already paid for it through their payroll taxes while working. Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) - Part B helps cover doctors' services and outpatient care. It also covers some other medical services that Part A doesn't cover, such as some of the services of physical and occupational therapists, and some home health care. Part B helps pay for these covered services and supplies when they are medically necessary. Most people pay a monthly premium for Part B. Medicare Part D (Prescription Drug Coverage) - Medicare prescription drug coverage is available to everyone with Medicare. To get Medicare prescription drug coverage, people must join a plan approved by Medicare that offers Medicare drug coverage. Most people pay a monthly premium for Part D. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \u200b Private insurance companies offer benefits in addition to original Medicare in the form of a Medicare Supplement or Medicare Advantage plan. A recipient will enroll in either a Medicare Supplement or Medicare Advantage plan, they can't have both. Below you'll see Q4 2020 enrollments including Med Sup and MA, you'll see there is a far larger market share for supplements than advantage plans. $CLOV only offers MA, they do not offer supplements which was . \u200b \u200b \u200b But that data is from 2016.... it's the most recent I could find. Enrollment in Medicare Advantage (MA) continues to grow at a steady rate as more (more than 8% last year) and more Americans are entering retirement. Yet, only 43% of the nearly 63 million people eligible for Medicare are enrolled in a MA in 2020. \u200b Medicare Advantage is a GROWING market, but does that growth have room for $CLOV as a major player? I don't see it. As you'll see below the large companies make up most of the market share in the Medicare Advantage space, and they do it well. That 18% of \"all other insurers\" is where $CLOV fits into the graph below. What concerns me about $CLOV is that a majority of those \"other\" companies are not-for-profit and affiliated with small networks and hospital group. Why is $CLOV operating for profit and publicly traded in this space. The SEC has questions as well. Red flags. The major carries include many extra benefits that seniors love, especially the fitness membership benefits included on most of the major plans. Looking through Clovers website I only saw dental/vision/hearing benefit included. These are usually a small reimbursement or a percentage discount for services and not comprehensive benefits you would expect. Speaking of their website, it is very generic.

We also have a cost of production which is among the lowest of any in our industry. An opportunity with such apparent strength and uniqueness needs analysis and understanding as to why it has been overlooked thus far. Imo firstly, COP is lower than Silicon Valley because of our location. Secondly, this opportunity has not been recognised yet, because the company is not based in Silicon Valley, where the usual tech investors and tech marketing is. This investor oversight may be a combination of home-town bias, the biologically limited attentional capacity of people, and the overwhelming press focus on the front-end tech businesses.

Current situation: everyone appears to be convinced that we will be plagued by crazy inflation in the near future Idea: I believe inflation will be short lived and we will revert to a deflationary environment in less than two years. Briefly, the rationale behind that is (1) stimulus checks/helicopter money programs will end, (2) the supply chain will go back to full capacity and demand will be met by offer, (3) no countries have implemented long standing relief programs, (4) demographics are going down and labor cost is going up, (5) globalization is increasing competition between companies, keeping prices down, (6) technological advancements push prices down. You can agree or disagree with such an idea, but we are not here to assess whether I\u2019m a moron or not. Question: how do I bet on deflation?

{"text": "I dont need to tell you about the trajectory of SNDL as a state-of-the-art licensed producer of cannabis. Part of this unstoppable trajectory is due to their strategy, industry leading technology/approach, clean balance sheet and vast amount of cash reserves they have recently raised. Currently sitting close to a Billion dollars in cash. The question is, how can it put these resources to the best strategic use? \\-SNDL has recently announced a string of acquisitions that piece together the necessary components to emerge as the winner in the newly budding cannabis industry in North America. As US legislation at a federal level approaches, the flood gates are soon to open. The recent acquisitions include the following: 1)Zenabis- Near the end of 2020, SNDL announced they closed the acquisition of a special purpose vehicle used to takeover a subsidiary of Zenabis Global, owning $58.9 million worth of senior secured debt of Zenabis Global. Much to the surprise of SNDL, wews abruptly came that H.E.X.0. would be acquiring Zenabis gloabl in $235 million stock deal to expand their global presence. Despite having the cash and being ready to pull the trigger, SNDL leanred a valuable lesson not to wait too long.. 2) Inner Spirit holdings- A retailer and franchisor of recreational cannabis stores. This helps increase it's market share and geographic footprint in North America. Purchased for only $106.7M. This time around, SNDL did not wait and succesfully acquired this company for strategic purposes. 3) Recently SNDL, acquired a 10% stake in The Valens Company. A growing parts supplier and leader in extraction, analysis of cannabis would make Valens an ideal fit for the growing brand and empire of Sundial. To have bought stock in the market would likely mean that an attempt to buy the company was already made. Sundial likley approached VLNS for an acquisition earlier, but when management turned down the offer they proceeded to accumulate stock. The Valens company would be a perfect fit for Sundials future potential. Today VLNS announced a bought-deal offering. This leaves the door open to a few alternatives: \\-Valens mgmt is trying to avoid an outright acquisition at this time in order to further seed a strategic investor (SNDL) knowing that there will be a take-out at somepoint in teh near future. SNDL is sitting on a billion cash, will be able to increase it's stake in the company further through this deal in order to accumulate more voteing authority over the company. Howver if the need arises, SNDL has more than enough bullets to go hostile and acquire VLNS at a premium. So WHAT do we DO? I think we continue to support SNDL buying stock to support our name. Annnnd since we know that SNDL has it's eyes on VLNS (VLNS.CA which it may acquire in the near future at a premium. We should also buy VLNS stock so that we have the ability to tender our votes if an acquisiton were voted on. We also get the added benefit of having our VLNS shares acquired for a premium.

Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher. With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run.

Which, I can't argue with - it definitely looked like self-promotion. So now, I've taken out the important details and summarized them as best as I can. I've put them in bullet points for everyone to discuss. > First, short selling can be one component of a well-functioning, liquid securities market and can contribute useful information to the price discovery process, under the right regulatory conditions. To start off, they agree short selling is important to price discovery of highly overvalued (and possibly fraudulent) stocks. Now, like most good things, they can be abused. > Second, short selling can interfere with fair, orderly, and efficient markets and substantially distort the price discovery process, under the wrong regulatory conditions. It there by can adversely impact the operation and price of capital for companies, especially early stage companies vulnerable to unlawful or abusive short-selling practices. Big point here is that new companies are especially vulnerable to short selling. Agreed. The main takeaway from their suggestions is that short-selling still has a place, but because of its allure to abusive actors, transparency and proper regulation should be implemented. I think everyone can get behind that. Now, here are their suggestions: 1. Update 13F form requirements to make sure they include standalone short-interest schedule, public reporting of threshold short interests and those involved in securities derivatives, and have it posted monthly instead of quarterly. 2. Implement a securities-lending regulatory and public reporting framework (that was apparently supposed to done through section 984(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010). 3. SEC must require FINRA to setup a system to get brokers to post daily short interest. 4. SEC must require FINRA to publish short-interest volume data daily and monthly short-interest transaction data. 5. Prohibit naked short selling - specifically, remove the market maker's exception to the locate requirement in Regulation SHO. 6. SEC make a short position accountability framework, and include special filing requirements for hard-to-borrow securities. They used \">90% short interest of float\" as an example that would trigger this. 7. Re-instate the uptick rule where short-sales must be done at a price higher than the previous trade. 8. SEC needs to tighten up on failure-to-deliver close-out requirements and enforce them properly. They recommended fees to punish this climb the longer failure-to-delivers remain open. 9. Settlement cycle should be reduced to T+1. They argued this would diminish the amount of phantom shares created. 10. The consolidated audit trail (CAT) need be reformed and properly implemented. They say short selling information should be included in this. In essence, there should be more ease of access and transparency in who borrows what and when.

{"text": "$UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It\u2019s the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. It\u2019s CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it\u2019s 12th employee and who\u2019s dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \\~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. # What trends are pushing $UWMC\u2019s stock down? The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates: About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. The strength of the broker channel: UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn\u2019t have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. Short Interest: Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi\u2019s are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. SPAC: It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money. Competitors: Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up? Short term retail pressure: there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM\u2019s long term perspective, so I\u2019ll let this post, so it isn\u2019t crazy to think they could get back to \u2153 as it is growing: [ I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket\u2019s retail channel has 4% margins and it\u2019s partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. New Product Offerings: UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM\u2019s, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation: Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. UWM \u201cAll In\u201d Ultimatum: Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don\u2019t work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway\u2019s partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. Aggressive Capital returns: UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \\~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. Long Term Prediction: I\u2019m invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \\potentially\\ growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years. \u200b Price Target: $14/share in 2023", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-18 00:20:55", "id": "neg3ey"}

{"text": "Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. \u200b Everything really on fire : We have seen about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year. Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up exponentially and parabolically in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line. \u200b US Federal Debt up 74X Total US debt up \u201conly\u201d 49X M2 Money Supply up 29X> Debt to GDP 1971: 37% \u2013 2021: 127% Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH. Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy. GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION Gold and Silver have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold. Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford. The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today\u2019s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

{"text": "E2Open ($ETWO) A 100% Cloud-Based SaaS Platform, And The Future Of Supply Chain Management With the Global Pandemic putting unprecedented strain on the national and global supply chain, and recent events such as the Suez Canal blockage, as well as the Semiconductor Shortage, there has never been a stronger demand for Supply Chain efficiency. President Joe Biden just recently began a 100-day assessment of the risks to supply chains, noting that the US\u2019\u2019 need for secure, diverse, dependable goods in notable sectors such as pharmaceuticals, semis, EV batteries, and rare earth minerals. This is where E2Open ($ETWO) comes into play. COMPANY SUMMARY \u201cLeaders win through logistics. Vision, sure. Strategy, yes. But when you go to war, you need to have both toilet paper and bullets at the right place at the right time. In other words, you must win through superior logistics.\u201d \\~ Tom Peters Essentially an unknown up-and-coming company that provides cloud-based, on-demand supply chain software that offers customers a significant value proposition. ETWO helps customers reduce inventory costs (10-20%), reduce direct materials procurement operating costs (50%), improve inventory forecasts (15-50%), and reduce supply chain staff (15%). ETWO has only recently went public on February 21\u2019, yet this relatively new company has already acquired and secured clients such as Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, Facebook, AMD, Nike, and many more (See Image Below for a better overall picture of its customer base). Another notable point is it\u2019s founders. According to Wikipedia, the company was founded as a joint project of 8 major companies: Hitachi, IBM, LG Electronics, Matsushita, Nortel, Seagate, Solectron, and Toshiba. This is no small matter, as these are massive companies that have large teams of experts making these decisions. The company is also trading very cheap in comparison to it\u2019s fundamentals and it\u2019s peers (Scroll down for a slightly deeper dive). A Snapshot of its largest customer base: A Snapshot Of Their Investment Thesis: Key Qualities Of ETWO, and Competitive Advantages It Has Over Its Competitors: Multi-enterprise network combining data with best-in-class intelligent applications integrated cloud platform delivering meaning ROI across supply chain First mover advantages from data connectors and harmonization Long term relationships with blue-chip, large enterprise customer base Attractive industry tailwinds and large TAM with significant white space Category-defining End-to-End provider of mission-critical software Strong network effects enhanced by flexible and integrated data model Key issues for current supply chains and how $ETWO is solving them: A Visual Of $ETWO 's business model: VALUATION The stock itself offers value to shareholders due to it\u2019s very cheap valuation compared to its peers, as well as it\u2019s massive potential for growth. At its current valuation, $ETWO is trading at an estimated EV/Rev multiple of 7 compared to an average of 11.7 among it\u2019s peers. It also boasts an EV/EBITDA of 21.3 compared to 29.2 and 59.1 from it\u2019s two closest competitors, Descartes and Kinaxis. They also boast an extremely low churn rate, which is a great indicator for SaaS platforms. This is further indication that the company is due for strong future growth. Below are some visuals demonstrating the value of ETWO: \u200b Strong Performance on Key Metrics: Attractive Long Term Financial Profile: Growth and Profitability: What Wallstreet is Saying \u201cIt takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you\u2019ll do things differently.\u201d \\~ Warren Buffett, Although it is a relatively new and low profile company (for now), it seems Wall Street is already taking notice. Loop Capital just recently rated it a BUY. Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Merwin also initiated coverage on $ETWO, and gave it a BUY rating as well. His words on the company: \"E2Open is a provider of supply chain management solutions to the enterprise. While the Supply Chain Management space is relatively mature, E2Open has assembled an impressive suite or products - organically and through M&A - which cover all functional areas of supply chain management, and importantly break down data silos to provide deeper insights into and efficiencies for the supply chain. With an improving cross-sell motion providing a $1bn expansion opportunity within its customer base today, we see long-term runway for at least low double digit top line growth along with 30%+ EBITDA margins through FY24. With shares trading at 6.1x/18.9x our CY22 revenue and EBITDA forecasts relative to similar growth peers median at 8.9x/22.2x we see an attractive entry point at current levels.\" One Final and Intriguing Note: A few popular, and reputable websites that display a company's short interest, state that $ETWO has a whopping percentage of it\u2019s float shorted (48% on finviz, at the time of this post). Short Interest: [ I am not sure what to think about this, as I also see that the put/call ratio for ETWO is a miniscule 0.02 on Barchart. Maybe someone can comment on this and maybe shed some light. Put/Call Ratio: [ Anyone interested in some further reading on the company, should check out this solid write up on $ETWO, as it makes some great points that I missed in mine: [ TL;DR: The cheaply valued ETWO and it\u2019s value proposition, it\u2019s allstar customer base (Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, Facebook, etc), as well as it\u2019s unique competitive advantage through their award winning software, offers its clients as well as its shareholders and potential shareholders, a bargain that is hard to resist. The growth potential is massive, the fundamentals are strong, and I believe we are looking at, in ETWO, the future of the supply chain management industry. Disclosure: This is by no means financial advice. I just like the stock. I also must disclose that I have both shares and December call options for $ETWO.

{"text": "Fellow morons, I'm going to keep this more or less brief, even though I'm sure no one will actually read this. Being in medical school, I may be slightly less retarded than some of you, at least when it comes to identifying groundbreaking biotech companies. Pretty much all my friends are tired of hearing me talk about this company, even as they have increased from $35 pre-pandemic to $125 in February. Just kidding, I don't have any friends. Natera (NTRA) is a diagnostic genetics company that specializes in the following three areas: 1) Pre-natal testing: making sure your kids aren't retarded 2) Pre-transplant testing: making sure your dumbass immune cells don't fuck up that new kidney you just got transplanted 3) Cancer testing: Finding out how much cancer is in your body by looking at the pieces of DNA that the cancer cells shed into your blood. The way we do this nowadays is by CT scans or MRIs, which aren't bad but can't find the cancer until it is big enough to see (\\~5 mm). Also, they cost a shit ton of money, and CT scans expose you to radiation (which can cause more cancer later). Point #3 is the reason why an irresponsibly large portion of my portfolio is in this company. They are already approved in colorectal cancer to: 1) Detect the levels of cancer in your body after surgery and help the oncologist determine if chemotherapy is even necessary 2) Determine whether the patient is responding to chemotherapy 3) Find out if the patient's cancer has come back on a microscopic level way before a scan could The way these kinds of tests go in terms of FDA approval is that they get approved in one cancer type initially before getting approved in cancer in general. More cancer types = more revenue = higher stock price. As it turns out, all cancers are kind of fundamentally the same regardless of where they come from in your body. This was the case with Foundation Medicine (FMI), a company I YOLO'd on before they got bought out at $137 a share that was first to market in qualitative tumor measurement (Natera's test is quantitative). Oh, and Natera works with Foundation Medicine, so they will probably end up being first to market in this expanding indication too. Natera just annihilated earnings but has sold off because all growth stocks are selling off. Their Y/Y revenue increased by 62%, and they have risen after earnings every single earnings report for the last 5 or so quarters. Median price target is $137.50. The only reason I'm not buying more is that I pay $40,000 a year to harvest old men's discharge from their cocks and am out of cash. Don't be like me; buy this shit at a discount and watch it print fat stacks. $Long NTRA, $NTRA 120c 6/18 TL;DR: Natera (NTRA) is going to change the way we treat cancer, just crushed earnings, and is only selling off because growth stocks are selling off.

{"text": "What if you knew where prices would go and when they would get there? It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns. \u200b Prices respect the channel lines and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play. \u200b Downtrend with channel break , you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal. ## How to Trade With Channel Lines Because channel line patterns offer areas that have a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement. \u200b ( The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the high risk to reward offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio. Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels: \u200b >Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there. \u200b ( Thanks for reading. I hope you learned something and enjoyed the article!

{"text": "[ GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on. \u200b Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot. \u200b If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips).

{"text": "On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash. And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote... By mid-July, we\u2019ll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase precious metals especially silver amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks. Gold rose over 60% in the 1930s as the prices of stocks and real estate crashed. You could buy an entire block with a one ounce gold coin. Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms. \"The Global ( Shortage\" acknowledged by the US Mint on their Facebook page. Now they sent those email to customers. There is a holy smokes now everywhere . \u200b \u200b This why stackers of all levels, whether big or small should feel proud of every gram or ounce of they own. They are draining the LBMA & CrimeX. In a highly leveraged market \u201c200 paper to 1 physical\u201d by some accounts and \u201c50 paper to 1 physical\u201d by some other accounts; Us Mint nowadays have a record high demand not seen in their history . So what's next : Aren't they required by constitution to make silver coins in a certain quantity? So which price ? Opportunity of buying silver cheap and timely is really about to end. THIS IS MEGA. It is even more evidence that the big tidal wave is turning in favour for Silver . Do not miss this train starting out, still very much at the ground floor. Expecting 15x ( 2 years .

This post isn't intended to draw away from that, just an opportunity that I see and would like to share. This play is based on $AMCs undoubtable liftoff to $30+. AMC READY TO FLY. Plenty of DD has been done on AMC and why its going to take off - I'm not here to talk about that. It is coiled, has popped, and is ready to rip a new butthole in the sky. \u200b $CNK is AMCs largest competitor and is in the great business we know as movie theaters. When AMC last went crazy, CNK ran up over 56% in a few days from 22-27 of January to $27+. In the past month, AMC is up over 50%. CNK is roughly even. It is lagging behind and is due for a major pop on this AMC craze. It is a classically more boring stock that takes a big nudge to move. CHART Breaking out similar to AMC. Insanely strong volume shelf in low 20s (high demand) and above 1D 21MA. RSI has lots of room to run. MARGIN CNK has a much lower implied volatility and actually allows for margin borrowing. This could be attractive depending on your risk appetite DILUTION/FINANCIALS CNK has almost no share dilution since the pandemic started, and it has been historically stronger than AMC from a traditional (retarded) financial perspective. AMCs market value growth has passed CNKs by many multiples over the past year. No reason she can't get some love. Don't overthink it. We love this guy.

{"text": "I know everyone is all about AMC and GME right now and by all means I have nothing but love for the Apes putting up the fight. I paper handed my AMC shares literally right before this last jump like an idiot. I bring up BBBY because right now it has a higher short percentage of float than both AMC and GME. According to Yahoo Finance as of 5/14/2021 the short percentage of float for each of these companies is: GME - 29.34% AMC - 21.13% BBBY - 64.38% BBBY also just announced a partnership with DoorDash to offer same day delivery. The stock jumped on this news. Additionally, BBBY is poised to benefit from restrictions being lifted as a reopening play. Unfortunately, the analysts don\u2019t have much consensus on the stock. BofA recommends it as a buy with a 12 month target of $38 in a report published on 5/28/2021. Morningstar recommends to hold with a target price of $22, but that report was on 4/21/2021.

{"text": "Hi here I want to tell you about what I think is the most undervalued stock right now. It can be a huge value play here\u2019s why: GROWTH : 37% yoy in revenues, cloud business with now positive Ebita and growing at 50%. The company operates in the online-retail market (mainly) in China, which is expected to grow its GDP and surpass the USA in 2028. Debt and Moat: Low debt, can pay all its debt with cash, so it can be considered a financial fortress as Buffett uses to say. Alibaba has definitely a moat with can be seen from different points of view: 1) Network effect = The fact that the 53% of online- retail sales is from Alibaba and its platform creates a continuous increase in the number of users. 2)Barriers to entry= In this market there are only few players becoming a sort of oligopoly. 3)Economies of scale= Alibaba has shown its ability to scale, and so to increase its revenues without decreasing its profit margins, and it is able to grow and at the same time to reduce the \u201cper-product-cost\u201d. 4) Substitution costs= Alibaba operates with online- salers which probably have made investments in order to position themselves in the Alibaba platforms, and it could be a huge cost to change platform. PRICE: Alibaba trades at 25/26 PE, forward PE of 20. And here nothing else to say. Considered the future growth is very cheap. WHY IT IS UNDERVALUED: It is undervalued because market hates uncertainty and I think that the market fears are A) Usa-China relationships B)CCP, because it is mainly a dictatorship and for example the ccp can do whatever he whats with its companies and population \u2014> WHY THE MARKET IS MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE: CCP is in continuous competition with USA, and I think that it will never destroy his \u201cdiamond tips - companies like BABA or Tencent. CCP ,as Charlie Munger said at BRK annual meeting in Los Angeles, has discovered the \u201cformula\u201d that is a form of economic-regulated capitalism. For these reasons I think baba is hugely undervalued and as its fair price could be 320/330$ per ADR share. P.S.

His current holding is less than 6.5 million shares. If you look at other insiders such as Ryan Taylor, Shyam Sankar, Matthew Long, David Glazer, Stephen Cohen, Peter Thiel, they also sold some although not as frequently as the CEO (yes, I know they have less shares comparatively) Now let's look at some counter arguments\\- Automatic sell: Looking at the number of shares in each transaction, you might argue that they are automatic sell. I know they are but if you believe in your company then why would you sell this kind of large number of shares that frequently? Like 3-5 transactions worth millions of shares every month, so early after the company went public? DPO vs IPO: You might say that the company went public via DPO and insiders need to sell the shares otherwise public wouldn't be able to buy them. I am here talking about the shares he kept selling after it went public. On the day they went public, they have already sold much larger shares. For example Peter Thiel sold 23 million shares, Alex Karp sold 13.7 million shares etc. Also, there is no shortage of float in market. On the first day of trading the volume was 338.5 million shares whereas 90-days average volume is only 74 millions. So, no he does not need to sell that frequently to keep the liquidity with demand(!). The price action rather says the opposite is true. Stock-based Compensations: You might also say their salary structure is heavy on stock based compensations. The company has been around over 13 years and he waited enough so he deserves some lambos. Yeah bla bla bla whatever as if he did not withdraw any salary each year. Now tell me why wait 13-14 years to go public? He needs money like everyone else: Another argument could be he needs to buy a Yacht or a mansion or a jet or whatever. Make the company profitable and cash positive first and then those $20 dollars stock will go to $50 or even $100 and then freaking buy 2 mansion and 3 yacht or whatever. If you keep dumping millions of shares each month when the stock kept tanking, many investors including retail and institutional, are holding large bags. Cathie alone will not be able to save it, she has already bought all the shares you sold since November 2020, and some more. TlDr: Not giving any kind of financial advice. I am not going to touch PLTR unless insiders, specially the CEO stops dumping shares frequently. If he does not like the stock of his company then who the hell am I.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-09 08:58:44", "id": "n7ziwe"}
{"text": "Looking closely at how the next couple of days go in AAPL. If we see a reversal back to the down side there could be a large pullback since this would confirm a daily head and shoulders break to the down side. Looking for a measured move from head the neckline, which falls the in the range of also filling a gap @ $96.19. Also, this past week AAPL has been testing it's 200 day moving average. If we continue the rally strong from this area then it will invalidate the head and shoulders pattern outlined above. If we close below that (currently @ $123.69) that would give more confirmation of this head and shoulders break to the downside. Another point of interest is that the SlowRSI is currently @ 33.29. Typically a bottom is put in when this reaches the 20 level or below. This itself is no reason for a pullback, but everything said put together strengthens the pullback argument. All said and done, I am bullish on AAPL but believe we need to see a deep pullback in order for it to be more attractive to the masses and drive more volume into the stock. After this potential pullback I can see AAPL rallying hard to the upside, so pay attention and be patient for a good entry.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-21 04:40:08", "id": "nh6ijq"}
{"text": "TLDR: The U.S. Government has confirmed several sightings of UFO's (possibly aliens). Several government officials have come out and said that U.S. military has had several encounters with physics-defying vehicles. Based off this evidence, defense stocks have a direct relationship with UFO disclosure. I recommend purchasing U.S. defense stocks due to recent UFO activity and human emotions. PLEASE READ, THIS POST IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME \\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is my first time posting on this subreddit. I hope this post can be welcomed with open arms like many other posts on this platform. This is a rather long post but it is definitely the most important one for not only this subreddit but Earth as a whole. I beg of you to take this post as serious as possible as I lay out claims that might not be considered \"realistic\" by some of you. Again, this is one of the most important issues of our time and I thought that it would be a great way to share this information with you guys since the spread of information on this platform is unmatched. The issue that I am referring to above is the growing contact/sightings of possibly extraterrestrial or extra-dimensional beings and crafts on Earth. This is an issue that everyone in the world should be familiar with and allocate their greatest interest in order to find the truth behind this. This post is very unusual compared to the others on this subreddit as most posts are stock market related. However, I promise that I will show the intersectionality between this global issue and finance throughout this post. I first began to become interested in this issue in December of 2020 while quarantined in South East Michigan when the former Israeli space security chief, Haim Eshed, announced to the Jerusalem Post that aliens are indeed real. He later stated in the interview with the reputable news source that extraterrestrials from distant planets are engaged in a \"Galactic Federation\" where important policies regarding issues between civilizations are made. Eshed exclaimed that the United States is in talks with the Galactic Federation and even have American representatives participating in meetings and research with these extraterrestrials in an underground base on Mars. The former space security chief states that the main purpose of the research is to understand \"the fabric of the universe\". Around this time, America's former president, Donald Trump, established the seventh branch of their military, the Space Force. Haim insists that Trump was briefed and is fully aware of this situation. He even says that Trump was \"on the verge\" of disclosing their existence, however, he was stopped by the Galactic Federation as they didn't want to cause \"mass hysteria\" due to the many conflicts we are facing today such as political divide, COVID-19, and degrading international relationships. Keep in mind that Haim Eshed is the one of the most credible, reliable, high-ranking, and intelligent individuals in regards to this issue. This would be comparable to if the head of NASA announced that intelligent life from other planets is a reality and that they are in communication with our highest-ranking officials. It is also important to mention that Israel's space agency is one of the best as they are one of only seven countries on the planet that build and launch their own satellites into orbit. Not only that, but Israel and the United States have a very good relationship regarding not only trade but military operations as well. This means that information is without a doubt transferred between the countries' military in regards to warfare and space. You may be asking why Haim Eshed is going public with this reality-shattering information nine years after his retirement in 2011. He claims that a lot has changed in the scientific community and that \"if I had come up with what I\u2019m saying today five years ago, I would have been hospitalized\". In the end, he stated that he is one of the most respected individuals in the academia setting and that he has \"nothing to lose. I\u2019ve received my degrees and awards\". Again, this is a man who served for 30 years as head of Israel's space program and is a three-time recipient of the Israel Security Award. Here is the original Jerusalem Post article \\PLEASE READ\\: Jerusalem Post Article or UAP's (unidentified aerial phenomenons) as they are known today by the U.S. Government. In the NYT report, it provides evidence to prove the U.S. Government's involvement in research programs investigating UAP sightings. According to Defense Department officials, included in the $600 billion annual defense budget was a virtually impossible to find $22 million allocation of money to an unknown Pentagon program called the Advance Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). The program's main responsibility was to examine proof of UAP's provided by various military sources and to determine whether or not it posed a threat to our country. The program was ran by a former military intelligence official named Luis Elizondo on the fifth floor of the Pentagon's C ring. The Defense Department has never acknowledged the existence of this program before and when asked about it recently they said that they shut it down in 2012. However, when the program's backers were asked about it, they confirmed that the Defense Department stopped funding back in 2012 but the program still continued to investigate several more episodes provided by service members until October of 2017 when Luis Elizondo resigned from the Pentagon to protest excessive government secrecy about this issue. New York Times Article \\PLEASE READ\\, Raytheon ($RTX), and Boeing ($BA) will be a great long term investment because I hypothesize that this situation is caused by only three scenarios. The first scenario is that there are extraterrestrials/extra-dimensional beings navigating the UAP's shown in the evidence above. The second scenario is that one of our country's nemesis like China or Russia has technologically leaped frogged us and created aircrafts that has defied our current understandings of physics. The final scenario is that the U.S. military has developed these crafts and in an attempt to keep our rivals from figuring out this information, they made a massive effort to hide it from the general public. All three of these scenarios ultimately conclude with the U.S. military's capabilities being expanded along with a giant budget increase. Higher budget means more money for big military companies like the ones stated above to develop cutting edge technology for the government. Again, whether this happens in June when UFO disclosure is released or 10 years from now when aliens make contact, this is an asymmetric trade meaning that the potential gains of buying defense stocks FAR exceed the potential losses. Now if you can take one thing from this post, it is that information is ESSENTIAL. What the U.S. Government has held from its people, is the greatest intelligence failure in United States history. This global issue affects us all significantly and as people of Earth, we deserve to have this information told to us in full. \\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Resources: THESE RESOURCES ARE STRICTLY FOR OBJECTIVE PURPOSES ONLY, NOT POLITICAL ( \\- UFO/UAP Sightings posted every single day ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( (", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-12 02:26:53", "id": "n9zlpn"}

{"text": "Everywhere you see, new car production is down, but demand is up. People can't make cars, people are buying cars, we even have used cars being used as an inflation hedge. Auto Nation, the most rednecky retailer in the USA, has almost tripled because of car demand. But we're running out of new car inventory, according to all auto retailers. And while production is super-low, factories closed everywhere, PGM's are super high anyway, even though PGM mining production hasn't dropped a ton. The only thing PGMs are used for (today) is catalytic converters, but soon they'll be in all of the hydrogen electrolyzers too. Sibanye bought Lonmin at the rock bottom of the platinum market. And then held them over the fire and renegotiated the deal, when platinum was at its lowest price ever. Best cost/ unit producer out there. I feel like their high, but stable, but high, but stable, price this last month, is about to take off, because of platinum prices. But I'm waiting for a dip anyway because the PGM market is nuts and I don't trust stability. Back in 2014, there was a big \"Platinum War\" where it was at 1400/oz (Sibanye bought Lonmin when it was 680/oz) new mines were being opened, ect, based on a 1400 ounce, (insert 'one does not simply open and close a mine' meme) then Europe switched from consumer diesels to electrics, PGMs tanked, and all the mines tried to keep staying open anyway. Low cost producers over-produced to force their higher cost competition out of the market by tanking the price even more. It worked. They flooded the market with platinum that is still getting burned off, and long term production tanked. Last time I checked, PGM production was below demand, pre-pandemic. There's someone out there who makes a good report if you want to check. Russia is opening a new platinum mine in Zimbabwe that should be open sometime. All I'm saying, is that when auto plants can stay open 24/7 after their workers are all vaccinated, there's a lot of demand to catch up on. And have you seen rhodium prices lately? Rhodium is used in hardening all PGMs for all industrial applications and is SBSW's biggest profit driver. What happens when platinum stops being dirt cheap, the excess is burned off, and the production deficit (mining production) is still there? This is the bottom of a long bull run that could have some crazy spikes from PGMs, especially rhodium, becoming more scarce.

{"text": "What up peeps. I want to cover two tickers here, $SNDL which currently meets the sidebar rules with today's move. 1.6B market cap and is trading above $1. I get it mods, you gonna mod but I'll keep writing. The other is the infamous $TLRY. The News... If you haven't read yet it looks like Federal Cannabis legalization my be around the corner. Here. $SNDL I'll start with the cheaper YOLO, $SNDL. $SNDL short interest isn't high, but the company did issue convertible notes a while back around .7c if my memory is correct. I'm not saying they won't do it again, but they should be in a good place fiscally for now. Float is high with about 1.6B shares out there. However today's volume at the time of writing is over 415M. That's not bad given such a high float. It's about 200% more than the average volume. The options chain on $SNDL has me giddy. With over 200,000 options currently in the money on todays move above $1 there is some high potential here for some interesting action. The put to call ratio is just obnoxiously low at .08 it's screaming upwards betting. If we hold above $1 the potential squeeze up could be amazing. It's also broken up on the trend lines and out of the downward channel it was in. The regression channel from the peak squeeze back in Feb just broke out today according to my crayons I have laying around. $TLRY $TLRY was the squeeze of a lifetime if you remember it back in 19'. The ticker was just a money printer with it's low float and stupid hype. Then they proceeded to do, like they all do, and issue debt. Shares tumbled since then falling from $120 --> $5. Ouch bag holders. Like all the cannabis stocks the Feb bump pushed $TLRY to above $60 in an amazing move. $TLRY has a lower short interest than $SNDL, but it also has a much lower float at about 300M. Compared to $SNDL the volume here isn't as good, but still remains decently above the avg volume around 36M as of right now. If we peep the options chain we also see a crazy low P/C ratio around .11. But we don't have the Open Interest in the chain like $SNDL does unless you roll out to Jun 18. Then we finally get some decent OI. Personally I am going with $SNDL. The option's chain looks better, the stock is cheaper, and the short interest is a little better. My advice would be to roll out till at least the Jun 11th $1 strike to not get eaten alive by Theta and IV crush. But WSB does what WSB wants and that's why I love you all. Do not go above the $2 strikes IMO. You will get crushed by theta unless we get an insane move, which could happen but I don't see the risk / reward there.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-29 04:33:28", "id": "nn326f"}
{"text": "Disclaimer This is my first shot at a DD since joining a year ago. Just as a disclaimer I\u2019m kinda retarded and not an expert at financial advise. I also hold 70 shares so I\u2019m definitely biased. What the hell is NNDM? Nano Dimension is technology company that specializes in 3D printing computer chips. The are aimed at disrupting the current method of computer chip manufacturing called PCB (Printed Circuit Board). Why should you care? As technology develops the need for more complex computer chips increases. Normal PCB fabrication is limited in is manufacturing capabilities. Nano Dimensions printers can print in 3D with multiple materials, allowing for better optimization of electronics. This has the ability to disrupt the ~$60 billion dollar PCB market. Also imagine having the capability of 3D printing chips in space without having to be resupplied every time you need electronics equipment. Not only does their product have the potential to be revolutionary but they manufacture and supply all the bulk materials for there product. So once a company buys their 3D printers they almost have to buy the consumables from NNDM. 2/3 of their revenue comes from the printer itself while the other 1/3 comes from support/consumables. They are buying up smaller nano printing companies and have secured almost all the competitive patents. One article said the next competition is 2-3 years behind NNDM What are the downsides? NNDM has been underperforming over the last year or so in its transition to mass market vendor. They are also struggling to gain a foothold in the PCB market right now. It\u2019s also been a rollercoaster of a stock, I have seen massive gains and subsequent losses all with in a few months of each other. Conclusion This is not a stock to buy if you\u2019re expecting instant gains with in a week or so. You invest in this company if you like the potential in their technology. I believe the stock right now at $7 a share is a steal because if they can optimize production for mass market I believe their stock could be $30+ in a few years. Also the short volume ratio is sitting at 27% which is higher than AMC\u2019s 23%.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-30 03:12:35", "id": "nnqo52"}

{"text": "Morning everyone. This post is by no way detailed with statistics or a deep dive into the company, this is just something I have been watching over the past 6 months as a very active social media user. Draftkings has 3-4 active Twitter accounts. The main one of coarse being simply @ Draftkings with 320K folowers (@ Fanduel only has 254k but who is keeping score) . Anyway, as Draftkings rolls out new programs like Sports Betting (@ DKSportsbook) or Casino (@ DKCasino) and you can get a pretty good idea of what the company will be doing or acting like by simply scrolling down their feed. Well if you have a minute, I suggest you scroll down the Twitter feed of @ DKCasino. They only have 200 posts or so since they are relatively new but you can see that when they started posting late last year, and literally only being live in a handful of states, they had free money promotions with almost no interaction. But now, especially the past month or so, you will notice every one of their tweets is now 1) a direct advertisement of one of their games that you can currently play 2)a sign up promotion 3) interactions with a player who has won money. 4) starting to have 30+ comments on every tweet. I think #3 is the key to the future. When investing in Draftkings everyone including myself constantly thinks \"Sports betting\" which we can all agree is a young mans/woman's game. Very few, including myself, have realized that Draftkings will be using all its power of brand name, player connection and social media to delivery a full LEGAL casino to your iPhone. The last sentence is simply fact, as I stated @ Draftkings twitter account has 320K followers, the @ DKCasino only has..... 2607 followers. YUP, thats IT, only TWO THOUSAND followers so far. I think this is a huge reason institutional investors like Blackrock or ARK are going in head first. They are buying a fully legal casino delivered to your door. You know those busses they run out of retirement homes into Casinos and back 3 times a week? Well why on earth would those old people spend hours on busses when the future of Casinos is a Draftkings app on a 24 inch Ipad screen in their rooms? Now you say \" Hey buddy, what does Draftkings know about casinos when they will be competing with PENN or MGM or WYNN. And in a sense you are right. But for a second, lets look at that retirement home scenario. Draftkings has NO brick and mortar casinos. Unlike PENN or MGM. Who benefits more from your grandmother NOT taking the free shuttle bus to the brick Casino, PENN/MGM who make money either way, or Draftkings who spends 0.0 $ on storefronts, employees, and every penny that Grandma spends playing in her room is 100% PURE profit taken away from PENN or MGM. Everyone keeps focusing on the amount of money Draftkings has spent on customer acquisition lately. That is the reason the stock price is down. Well if you think of them acquiring future Casino customers that they are taking away from PENN, MGM and WYNN. It makes more sense of why they are spending so hard.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-05-28 00:37:15", "id": "nm7muv"}
{"text": "I have done so much DD on this play and I really want to share it with you guys since WSB is the reason I started investing over a year ago. In this post I'm going to not talk about some kind of currency that can get this post removed. Hint: it crashed big time yesterday. You know the one. There is a new kind of this currency that uses a lot of computer storage space. How much? Well - 7 EXABYTES and it's currently adding 1 exabyte every 3 days. I'm going to assume you know about this currency and if not you can look through my post history and see which subreddit I've posted to recently involving this particular one. #Topics of discussion: Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks WDC Fundamentals * Bear case #If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. #Fundamentals WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency. WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay. #The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market. The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality. The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them. But wait - there's more. WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant. A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually. #Bear case Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed. The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects. The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. #Summary TL;DR HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80Positions\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 ( ( I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency.

{"text": "\u200b \u200b Introduction to the upcoming pool supercycle: I'm sure you have all seen the post-pandemic housing boom and the effects it has had on lumber prices going through the roof. Many of these houses are being built in suburban areas where backyard pools are very popular. Having a pool is not just a one-time expense like building a house would be. Pools require constant maintenance and expensive servicing and chemicals almost like owning a pet, you're always buying something else for it. There are 5.2 million residential inground pools in the U.S. and 255,000 commercial pools. It is estimated that 60-70% of these pools use chlorine tablets. There are an estimated 200,000 new swimming pool purchases in 2020-2021 a dramatic increase. Adding pool permits has seen 32% year-on-year growth. The rapidly rising number of new pool owners combined with a major chemical plant fire in Lousiana has caused an upcoming massive chlorine shortage. Chlorine prices in some areas have already doubled. Chlorine prices are expected to spike up to 70% this summer. There is one company that is uniquely poised to benefit the most from these circumstances, that company is Leslie's Swimming Pool Supplies. Ticker $LESL \u200b \u200b The Company: Leslie's swimming pool supplies is the largest direct-to-consumer brand in the U.S. pool and spa industry. They have been in business since 1963 and have 940 physical locations and a large e-commerce platform. Leslie's serves residential pools, residential spas, professional pools, & commercial pools so they cover all the bases. The majority of Leslie's products are non-discretionary and exclusive. 80% of their sales are non-discretionary (necessary purchases) \u200b \u200b The Chlorine Situation: You may be thinking to yourself well this sounds stupid wouldn't the manufacturer of the chlorine tablets just pass on the added costs to Leslie's. Well, aren't we in luck turns out Leslie manufacturers their own chlorine tablets. This puts them in a great position as one of their competitors literally burned down. 45% of Leslie's sales come from chemicals. They make and sell the chlorine tablets with almost half of their business coming from chemical sales the majority of that being chlorine. \u200b \u200b Financials: Leslie's just became publicly traded last fall. They have had 57 consecutive years of sales growth with a 7.1% sales CAGR since 2001. They just recorded record 2021 Q2 earnings. They had sales of $192.4 million, an increase of 52.3% from the prior-year quarter. They had a net loss of $(6.5) million compared to $(29.8) million in the prior-year quarter. They adjusted EBITDA of $9.5 million compared to $(8.1) million in the prior-year quarter, an improvement of $17.6 million. They also raised their fiscal 2021 sales outlook by $75 million, Adjusted EBITDA by $25 million, and Adjusted net income per share by $0.10. Gross profit increased 79.6% to $71.7 million from $39.9 million in the second quarter of 2020 and gross margin was 37.2% compared to 31.6% in the second quarter of 2020, an increase of 567 basis points. Following this news, the stock rose 10%. Just kidding lol, $LESL tanked to a low of almost 13% today murdering my calls. \u200b \u200b The Bear Case: There are two other chlorine manufacturers in the US, one is not publicly traded and the other is not a favorable investment in my opinion. Another bear idea would be to just invest in one of their competitions like $POOL who would seem undervalued compared to $LESL at a short glance. $POOL primarily deals in the selling of construction equipment for the building of the pools and is not as favorably positioned as $LESL on the chemical and pool upkeep side. Obviously, I did not spend a lot of time on this section because I'm not an idiot who believes the collapse of the global financial sector is imminent. \u200b \u200b Wrapping it up: I think $LESL is a very favorable play for the upcoming summer. I think with the mass vaccinations people will want to hang out with friends by the pool more than ever and the upcoming shortage and amount of pools built is already proof of that. Another thing to keep in mind is the summer Olympics this summer could make people want to swim. That's kind of a reach but I think it will. I would play this by buying a calls a few months out. I will be readjusting my position after getting crushed on the ER selloff today. \u200b This is not financial advice spend your money however you want.

{"text": "Hi there apes, So since the wrong SI% of float report came out, lots and lots of calls have been bought (maybe too many?). Right now the SI% of the float is actually still very high around 41% according to S3Partners, equal to 44.7m shares shorted. This leads me to the next thing, the total OI for calls is 598,882. If all these were to be executed that's 59.8m shares. So 59.8 (call OI) + 44.7(shares shorted) = 104.5m shares. The public float is 109.8m shares. Vanguard holds 26.2m shares. If you add these 26.2m shares to the 104.5m shares that is a total of = 130.7m shares. 20m+ shares MORE than the public float? Even if Vanguard sold covered calls on all their shares that would leave us with only 5.5m shares not being sold CC's on (not very likely) So this means lots and lots of these calls are sold naked! For a gamma squeeze to happen you would need lots of calls at different strike prices, which CLOV has! Actually, it's insane to me how this many May and total calls have been sold, with literally no shares to back them up. Options table of CLOV below: \u200b Picture down below of the Call OI. Table of how all this is calculated What could be the catalyst start all this? Well ER is on the 17th of May, so before all the may call expire. Furthermore, the DOJ investigation (what actually caused CLOV to go down in the first place) is now over. No PR yet, so I assume they will bring this up on ER! Other than that, they have not yet made an announcement, but they just got approved to expand in 10 more states. That is massive. On top of that Biden and democrats are looking to lower the Medicare eligibility age to 60. That will help Clover get a bunch of new customers.

I\u2019m not good at words so here\u2019s some things someone smarter than me said along with the most recent Ortex so about 15mm shares. This theoretically lowers the float to 90mm shares because most institutions will hold long term. So realistically we are looking at >30% of float is shorted. Also keep in mind that the numbers are estimates and this could very well be higher as utilization has also been 100% for a couple weeks now. \" - /u/Strobe\\_light10. Looking at $GOEVs low volume along with the open interest for the 5/21 OTM call options is where things get insane. For those too lazy to read and don\u2019t know, open interest is the number of options currently open. \u200b \u200b |5/21 Strike|Open Interest| |:-|:-| |10|16481| |12.5|6787| |15|20273| |17.5|7515| |20|8164| |22.5|16273| |25|7868| |30|4430| |35|7175| \u200b Numbers were pulled today at 3:00 HOUSTON TIME \u200b If you don\u2019t know that each option represents 100 shares then you\u2019re a literal moron and belong in this shitty sub. So those 16k 5/21 10c contracts are equivalent to 1.6m shares. When GOEV hits $10, market maker bitches will have to buy 1.6m shares to cover the call options. This is also assuming that market makers haven\u2019t hedged the 10c, which why would they? The stock is shorted to shit and no one expects it to hit $10. And that\u2019s only the 5/21 10c, look at the other strikes. My bet is if this shit hits $10 next week, the damn thing is soaring into the 20s, maybe the 30s. EARNINGS REPORT The one and only catalyst for this play; the earnings report happening on 5/17. Last earnings call went to shit and stock price tanked after Tony Tequila opened his big stupid fucking idiot dumb mouth. What this means though is that they\u2019ll want to send some good news our way and save this shitty boat from sinking. In all seriousness, I\u2019m a fat Canoo bull long-term after listening to last earnings call, but investors panicked and shorts hopped on the red train. Tony mentioned releasing good news \u201csoon\u201d (manufacturing details among other things) and this could happen during this call. CONCLUSION This powder keg is ready to explode and all Canoo has to do is give us some good news on 5/17 to ignite the barrel. Quit FOMOing into shit after it\u2019s already popped, and jump on the boat before it leaves the harbor. This is a short-term play with a long-term hodl potential, so calls if you're a ultra giga chad, shares if you're just a chad. Pros: \\- Short interest is through the fucking roof \\- Open interest is higher than shit and has created a nice gamma ramp that we can walk to the moon on \\- Canoo is feeling a lot of pressure from investors to release some good news \\- GOEV is near its ATL, literally can't go any further down Cons: \\- This earnings call could be negatively received like the last one \\- It'll be hard to decide whether to buy a lambo or yacht first If you want actual long term hodl DD on Canoo, the crazy motherfuckers on the Canoo subreddit (who are wanting to stalk Tony Aquila's private jet) would be more than happy to tell you why GOEV is a solid investment.

{"text": "First off, I\u2019ve seen a lot of LOW QUALITY DD coming out recently. So, I\u2019m looking to change that. This is my second DD, and my goal (as always) is to provide you with ALL the info I have so you can make your own EDUCATED decisions. THAT MEANS do not just take my word for any of this. I suggest you all \u201cTrust but verify\u201d. Similar to my first DD (Energy Transfer, ET \u2013 which has done quite well btw), I\u2019m not going to mention short interest because you should invest in shit for better reasons (my personal opinion). But briefly...there isn't much short interest. Which indicates to me that the market as a whole is bullish on this pick. # ------Ternium ($TX)------ Background As any quality DD begins, lets start by explaining basically who Ternium is. Ternium ($TX) is Latin America\u2019s leading flat steel producer with an annual crude steel production capacity of 12.4 million tons. TX operates in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, the southern United States and Central America through regional manufacturing facilities, service centers and its own distribution network. In addition, TX participates in the control group of Usiminas, a leading flat steel company in the Brazilian market. Their customers range from small businesses to large global companies in the automotive, home appliances, heat, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), construction, capital goods, container, food and energy industries across the Americas. TX\u2019s industrial system has various production technologies that provide a diversified cost structure, based on different types of raw material and energy sources, and a flexible production configuration. The industrial system includes proprietary iron ore mines and processing facilities, steelmaking facilities, finishing facilities, service centers and a broad distribution network to offer slabs, billets, hot-rolled products, cold-rolled products, galvanized and electro-galvanized sheets, pre-painted sheets, tinplate, welded pipes, rebars and wire rods as well as slit and cut-to-length products. A large number of co-products result from the steel manufacturing process. These can be reutilized, thus helping to reduce CO2 emissions. In the latest years, TX has achieved a 100% material efficiency and the number of co-products resulting from the manufacturing processes has increased significantly. Their steel then created utilizing both Electric Arc Furnaces and BOF Converters. Blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace uses iron ore as its base raw material that accounts over just 50% of BOF steel costs, and electric arc furnace uses scrap as its base that represents around 75% of EAF steel cost. The Basic Oxygen Steelmaking process differs from the EAF is that BOF is self-sufficient in energy. \\------------------- Fundamentals and Recent Accomplishments/Developments: P/E=4.81 (really fucking low, which means it has room to grow) Forward P/E = 5.42 (Growing and still low, which means its growing) Debt/Eq = 0.25 (very very low, stable company) EPS has been consistently improving \\(and beating\\) expectations. futures. ]( \\------------- Fair Value Estimate: Tipranks: Hold - $44, corresponds to Scotiabank estimate FINVIZ: Target Price = $45.73 \\-------------- Outlook Ternium expects a sequentially higher EBITDA in the second quarter primarily due to an increase in realized steel prices, partially offset by higher cost per ton due to higher iron ore, scrap and slab costs flowing through the company\u2019s inventories. Following the pandemic-induced decrease in steel consumption during the first half of 2020, an increased demand for steel has outpaced the speed of the recovery in global steel production. This has driven a significant increase in steel benchmark prices around the globe over the last nine months. Iron ore benchmark prices are also reaching multi-year highs. The company currently expects these conditions will tend to normalize during the second half of 2021. Ternium expects the commissioning of its new hot rolling mill in Mexico during June 2021, with ramp-up during the second half of 2021, will contribute to increase its market offering in this scenario, with an expanded product range and improved productivity levels in its industrial system. Ternium anticipates sequentially higher realized steel prices in Mexico in the second quarter of 2021, as prices in the USMCA market continue to increase and quarterly contract prices reset. Ternium also expects volumes in Mexico to increase in the second quarter, with strong demand from exports-driven industrial customers and steady activity in the commercial market. \\-------------- Catalyst \u2013 Biden Infrastructure Plan At least 21 senators from both parties have backed a framework that seeks to spend roughly $1 trillion on transportation, broadband and water systems. This requires a fuck-load of steel. The talks are still ongoing though, so we\u2019ll see if something gets done.

{"text": "Since I saw a lot of misinformed comments in the daily threads, I figured I would share this information. The current borrow fee rate for CLOV is 116.7% ( The borrow fee rate is not the short interest; that is the number of shares shorted. The borrow fee rate is the amount it costs per year to short a share, as shorting requires borrowing. To put it into perspective, for a costant price, a yearly borrow fee rate of 116.7% would imply a daily cost of paying 0.3197% of the value of the shorted share. 0.32% in the world of returns is a lot. Yesterday, the short interest rate on CLOV was 43.54% ( This number might be lower now, as the borrowing fee rate depends on other factors (volatility, ease of locating shares) than just the supply available; shorts may have covered a bit. It will, however, not be a lot lower. What this implies is that for some 30%-50% of the number of shares available on CLOV, the shorts are paying 0.32% of the price of the share just for holding the position, every. single. day. The shorts are absolutely bleeding buckets. In fact, this situation, including the drop today, is incredibly similar to GME; I dare say even more so than AMC. Another great buy, support each other please. I currently hold multiple call options comprising 19% of my portfolio, and that's only because GME takes up 60%. Obligatory rocket emojis \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Edit: Since I made this thread I received a lot of good, confirming information, which I would like to summarize here: - The short interest rate is currently at 50.42% according to Ortex. - model states CLOV is currently most likely to squeeze. - questrade Canada also has a borrow fee of 59%. - Additionally shows that CLOV has a bullish sentiment with a low share availability score of 4, meaning shares are confirmed really limited across the board. This means multiple brokerages are confirmed to have a hard time locating shares. That is huge. Remember what caused GME to not be allowed to be bought anymore? Borrowing fee rates were high for a ton of brokers, and some, including IBKR and Robinhood, had these high borrowing rates in place because they were running out of shares to locate. They could no longer provide the shares they are obligated to provide to those who either want to short or buy the share. And hence they shut both down, as otherwise the brokerages themselves would trigger an insane and instant shortsqueeze. An incredible indicator.

{"text": "I\u2019ve been following since IPO and I\u2019m very familiar with how it trades. I\u2019m not here to convince anybody to buy and I\u2019m not here to say other stocks suck. Go ahead and promote your stock I don\u2019t give a shit. I\u2019m simply stating what I believe is going to bare investors fruit soon. Great part is you don\u2019t have to hold through all the bullshit manipulation to capitalize. Before diving in to why I think RKT is a huge buy right now there\u2019s something that should be discussed before reading this. All these \u201cmeme stocks\u201d are posted when the stock is already up 50%. This one of those get in before that happens. I don\u2019t think RKT is a meme stock to be honest\u2026and fuck that term. Just because we do our diligence and like the stock doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a fucking meme stock. I get that this is a Wendy\u2019s, there are dumb asses, but dummies can make money too. I like the idea of buying/hold and averaging down here at this moment. It might not go back down too much at this point. RKT is up 20% over the past two weeks. There are a lot of retail investors that were ready to get out at 22 and a lot of swing traders just playing the gap fill. The thing is those shares have been getting brought up. The only reason the stock dropped as low as 16 is for two reasons: one, Gilbert transferred class D shares to class a shares for employee stock program at a 15% discount in order to increase the float and allow for more institutional ownership. This actually really helps the stock. Two, Growth funds sold the stock and now value funds are eating it up. This also includes a recent purchase from Swissbank. The stock is trading differently and shorts are having a lot harder time manipulating it due to the institutional accumulation in the Russell 1000 and additional value funds. You can check my previous DD\u2019s for sources and more info. Right now the stock just filled the gap and hit a wall around 22.7. Institutions are letting retail buy and testing their patience. Reason why institutions do this is because they need to determine whether there are real investors or just impatient little children that cry if a stock doesn\u2019t go up 50% in 1 hour. Once they see where we are buying they won\u2019t allow people to accumulate very long at those levels. What happens next is called a retest at 22.7. Since Its already been doing some consolidation at those levels it will most likely break and when it does break it will go to 25. If 25 creates a lot of volume and attention there are about 45,000 contracts for June 18 at 25. 25 could be a huge wall of resistance but there could be a plan in place or this could just be a fake out before it actually takes off. I believe the floor 18.5 or 19.5 so I would look to accumulate at now, 19.5, and then load up at 18.8 with a stop loss of 16ish if you want. I believe they would initiate the buyback before it gets back below 17 simply because employees get the stock at a 15% discount and Dan transferred shares at 16.8ish so I would assume the stock stays 15% above this level. Now I wanna be very clear that this is not a fucking mortgage play. Right now that is what the market wants retail to believe. This is about a company I have previously worked for and I know firsthand that they achieve the goals set forth. They have yet to prove otherwise. Rocket homes is basically Zillow and their activity increased 300% in quarter one. Additionally rocket auto drops this August. I don\u2019t know about you but I don\u2019t get too thrilled going on to Carvana or Kelley blue book in order to find a car I talked to three different people before I actually get to the person that I want and then I have to find financing. Rockets mission is to make this as easy as possible so you can go onto a very clean website pick a car you want they will do the financing for you and then provide you with the vehicle. Won\u2019t be surprised if they shipped the shit right to you eventually. Keep in mind that Detroit used to be the home of car manufacturing. Didnt Gilbert basically owns Detroit after buying up all the real estate after 2008 and has been rebuilding it since. It\u2019s a totally different city now I have recently been there. One thing I really want to put emphasis on is the brand. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you started to see rocket homes commercials and a rocket auto commercials before September. They have also linked partnerships with golfers with big names and are using that for more marketing. As of right now they have not even started marketing these aspects but trust me it would be insane to think that they won\u2019t make it work because if it\u2019s one thing they know how to do it\u2019s to market. Everyone wants the next big thing, you\u2019ll see commercials over and over again and eventually you\u2019ll actually see what rocket auto is about. When you see the platform you will hands-down choose it over any other bullshit website out there currently for cars. On top of that, they\u2019ll be the ones to provide you with the loan, they\u2019ll be the ones to profit off the sale. They don\u2019t need a financing company like typical dealerships when you buy a car. They will fund it right to you. Competing with Zillow is a bit more of a challenge but I still think they will prevail. The company has a shitty PE ratio right now because it\u2019s still being valued as just a mortgage company. Institutions however aren\u2019t stupid and know this will change once the sectors start being marketed. You can see the price action right now is it institutional accumulation before they let retail pump it up. If you think that institutions would start buying a stock based off of mortgage credentials in a rising rate environment then I don\u2019t know how you\u2019ll ever be convinced. That is not what they\u2019re doing. What I do know is that they probably believe that the amount of income they\u2019ll receive from their new revenue streams will certainly provide RKT the capital to obtain more market share in that field. Which is lucrative. Companies like Amazon wish they could get into mortgages. Except it\u2019s very difficult field to just enter. No one knows anything about mortgages except for people who do it. Did you know that Lindsay gross gave a speech, He was Dan Gilbert\u2019s roommate in college at law school. He actually expressed Amazon had an interest in mortgages, this is when the company was private. After looking over all of the financials and complications they decided they wouldn\u2019t actually be able to be successful due to their business model. RKT got lucky and was at the right place at the right time. They merged technology with mortgages which is extremely profitable allowing for a constant stream of very high revenue, thus creating easier means to market additional revenue streams as they plan on doing. Position: 2600 shares @ 17.86 and 100 40.89s for 2023. I also have additional calls but I don\u2019t really like giving that information out because I\u2019m a little paranoid about hedge funds reading this shit. This is not advice I\u2019m just stating the facts. If you\u2019re looking to enter a position I believe the stock will test 25 and possibly all time highs in the next few months. I believe by 2023 it\u2019ll be over 150 a share. I would buying share until iv dies down on options. Another thing I want to mention is that leaps are crazy expensive right now. I wonder why. TLDR: rocket auto and rocket homes are soon going to be a very well-known products and institutions are starting to accumulate and take notice. This is not a mortgage play this is a value play. Don\u2019t ever listen to any articles to justify price action that\u2019s for the sheep. It just makes sense. All you have to do is accumulate for the next two weeks and I think you\u2019ll just see green moving forward. Below $20 a share won\u2019t be seen after September ever again imo. Edit: typos Edit 2: if you want to invest in a mortgage company then sure invest in both RKT and Uwm. If you want to invest in a mortgage and soon to be tech giant with massive growth and 194th richest company on Fortune 500 then invest in RKT. Idk about you but mortgages are boring. I like innovation. I like a company that\u2019s ranked the fifth best place to work in the entire country. I like the company that is ranked the number one largest mortgage lender for over 10 years by JD powers. The best part is, it took three decades to get to this point so any competitor is going to have to play 30 years of catch-up at Rockets pace and trust me nobody works more than the people at RKT. 60 hours a week is a norm but execution is worshipped.

{"text": "Strap in, this is gonna be a long one. A lot happened this week, yet despite all the turmoil the SPY closed down less than %3 on the week, IWM a little worse off at under %4 and QQQ about unchanged. As we\u2019ll discuss, there\u2019s a different story lurking beneath the surface and it\u2019s questionable just how much this volatility can be contributed to the Fed\u2019s comments on Wednesday. ###Fed Reaction At the risk of being labelled a Fed apologist, I have to ask what were people expecting? Those recently screeching about inflation risks should be happy: the Fed has taken note that it\u2019s transitory, they are guiding for possible rate hikes in 2023, two years from now. Though this view could change in the coming months as supply chain issues resolve and data \u201cnormalizes\u201d, this recent adjustment in guidance shows that the Fed seems to be acknowledging current data and willing to quickly adjust it\u2019s long-term view. Like, what more do you people want? This is not a bad thing, and given their current intention is to create some inflation (but not too much), I think they\u2019ve been dead-on in their approach. ###Market Reaction From a market perspective we had two catalysts this week: the Fed notes on Wednesday and a quarterly Opex on Friday that involved a massive gamma roll-off have been on the up. ###Reflation Trade Breakdown? XLF 1y followed through on that failed breakout. Looking to bonds, US10Y yields shot up post-announcement and then came right back down: TNX 5d indicating that \u201c\u2026investors are pulling back on expectations of inflation remaining sticky and are beginning to price in a more benign inflation outlook in line with the Fed\u2019s forecast of a transitory or temporary increase in inflation\u2026\u201d (source is marked as spam): US30Y less US05Y and is pricing that in. ###Opex Volatility Contrary to the action above, SPY and QQQ held up Wednesday into Thursday and then had moves to the downside Friday (though the latter held up well), which I think is more a result of the massive Gamma roll-off rather than reaction to the Fed. SqueezeMetrics SPY/DIX/GEX. It is worrying that this trade has lost steam prior to this week, but the sudden pivot by markets to think that we won\u2019t have any inflation does not line up with what the Fed has been indicating with it\u2019s average inflation targeting - we\u2019ve just gone from the markets thinking the Fed won\u2019t be able to control or prevent runaway inflation to the Fed crushing any inflation at all (i.e. the last decade). I think we\u2019re gonna be somewhere in the middle or the former: wage increases aren\u2019t going to reverse and the Fed wants some inflation stickiness in the short-term - it\u2019s a good thing!We\u2019ll need to watch this trade for the next few weeks to see if it is truly done with or this is just a reactionary pullback. The Gamma unwind sets us up for possible volatility, and downside risk remains. Analysts have been suggesting a pullback towards the %10 range for some time now, but markets have remained resilient overall. This could continue but the specter seems to loom larger the longer we go. Pullbacks are normally a healthy thing, and a buy-on-dip opportunity if we get one. Overall, one or two days does not establish a trend and I think we need to watch closely over the next week or two to see how things resume after this past week\u2019s furor. #Bonus Charts In one of my previous posts I highlighted a possible breakout/breakdown in ATVI and APPL respectively and wanted to revisit these charts: ( ( ATVI broke above my signal line at the $98-99 range and then immediately broke down ( Meanwhile, AAPL flirted with breaking below it\u2019s 200DMA and then immediately reversed and established an upward trend. It\u2019s hitting resistance around the $130 level, and I\u2019d say we\u2019d need to see this break out above the $135-136 level to be legit. ####Previous", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-06-21 06:29:35", "id": "o4d2vf"}
{"text": "Renewable Natural Gas has the lowest uphill battle with the maximum amount to gain. Summary of article: There are 4 types of alternative commercial transportation energy options: Biodiesel and Renewable Diesel Natural Gas Battery Electric Hydrogen Fuel Cell CNG and RNG provided cost savings of around $1 per gallon over diesel before the crude oil market plummeted at the end of 2014. This was when the price of oil was above $100 a barrel. With fuel spikes this will come back where cng is more economically feasible. CNG is positioned to be one of the most practical alternative fuels if all other factors align. Battery Electric requires a lot of infrastructure and stations to recharge. Limitations on the range of battery charge further exacerbate this challenge. Batteries are extremely heavy. Trucks have weight-restricted carrying capacity, so it is unappealing to forego a full truck for an electrified powertrain. Additionally, battery technology is limited by time and range. Once it is fully charged ranges sit around 200 miles. Most long-haul shipments are 1,000 miles or more. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles face an even steeper uphill battle than electric in terms of infrastructure. While hydrogen trucks will need fewer recharges due to their extended range, they still need specific hydrogen fueling stations.

Sofi has features such as Checking Accounts, Credit Cards, Stock Investing, Student Loan Refinancing and Origination, Personal Loans, Mortgage Refinancing, Auto Loan Refinancing and Early Payday, so you can blow your Wendy\u2019s paycheck 2 days earlier. The vast array of products they offer and partnerships they have formed with other companies gives them a unique ability to cross-sell their products to customers and retain customers by doing so. For example, someone may come to SOFI refinance their gender studies student loans, but end up banking and investing with them. This is because of a singular key factor. Convenience. Sofi\u2019s target audience for their products are millennials who are financially savvy. What do we know about millennials? They value convenience. It\u2019s why people will use Grubhub, Doordash or Uber-Eats despite the absurd fees and cold tendies they receive; why people will use Amazon Prime to order stuff rather than go in person; why people will use Robinhood despite it going down every time something interesting actually happens in the market. This creates a dynamic where people will switch over their entire financial life to Sofi in order to simplify things, and makes Sofi in many ways, a superapp in the making, similar to that of Alipay. Sofi has worked out deals with big banks so that retail can get an equal footing in IPO\u2019s. Provided a Sofi member has $3,000 in their Sofi Invest account, they are eligible to get in on an IPO at the IPO\u2019s reference price, as opposed to market price. lending, which makes up a large portion of their revenue, however as time goes on and we see an expansion and more adoption of their financial services (Banking, Credit Cards, Investing), we will see this shift to be more diversified. Sofi projects 43% CAGR, which is far above other companies in the sector, such as PayPal and Square, who project 20.2% and 29.3% respectively. Sofi will be profitable this year as well, and by 2025 will be raking in Billions of dollars in annual profits. Overall, Sofi is in a very healthy position with a boatload of cash on hand ready to expand the business, be it through acquisitions, or building out products. Graph go brrrr today. Companies such as Robinhood rely on Galileo to power aspects of their business, such as issuing debit cards and opening accounts. What this means for all you smoothbrains out there, is that as those companies grow and gain members, Sofi gets a cut of that. Though Robinhood is the most well known of the companies handled by Galileo, there are dozens of others who all rely on it to power their businesses. !img Price Action? Crayon Says Stock Go Uppies \ud83d\ude80 is when big investment firms are offered the ability to invest before a merger is announced at a favorable price. In doing this, their shares are locked up for a period of time so that they don\u2019t immediately sell. As of last Friday, PIPE investors were able to sell their shares if they wanted. On Friday and Monday, we saw high volume price action with lots of volatility. Friday was somewhat brutal for holders, but Monday not only presented opportunities for dip buying, but had a great close. Sofi rejected the lows of 17.6 and closed at 19.4, significantly above the $18 support level. TLDR? Stock Goes Uppies Tomorrow. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 !img Short Squeeze? Sofi currently has over 28 million shares short sold, with borrow fees costing hundreds of % in fees. Admittedly, some of this is due to PIPE holders hedging their positions (Long PIPE shares, Short shares on the open market), but there is almost certainly some non pipe related shorts. There are almost no shares available to short at any given time however, and retail are getting paid 46% interest just for diamond handing shares and lending them. Pretty sweet right? With the bullish price action today and high short interest, this could be a powder keg ready to be set off with rocket fuel \ud83d\ude80.

Losses on your investments are first used to offset capital gains of the same type. So, short-term losses are first deducted against short-term gains, and long-term losses are deducted against long-term gains. Net losses of either type can then be deducted against the other kind of gain. For example, If you have $2,000 of short-term loss and only $1,000 of short-term gain, the net $1,000 short-term loss can be deducted against your net long-term gain (assuming you have one). If you have an overall net capital loss for the year, you can deduct up to $3,000 of that loss against other kinds of income, including your salary and interest income. Any excess net capital loss can be carried over to subsequent years to be deducted against capital gains and against up to $3,000 of other kinds of income.

{"text": "MP Materials. Ticker symbol MP. I can make this sophisticated but will keep it short. The hot topic seems for ever are electrical vehicles. And if anyone thinks we here in the USA has a clear cut advantage; you're mistaken. You can be the most talented cook in the world and make the greatest steaks, but what happens if you have no access to cows? Your talent is irrelevant!!! Listen to these FACTS carefully: Without the ingredients such as you can't make a steak without cows; without RARE EARTH ELEMENTS, there is no such thing as an electric car. So the talented engineers of electric cars in the USA have a problem. The problem? 85%. Yes 85% of the world's RARE EARTH ELEMENTS, the ingredients needed to make an electric car, comes from China!!! Yes China. You can say 95% of Tesla's parts are Chinese. And now China is in the electric car game in an ALL IN fashion. And I am talking ALL IN!!! Do you guys really think the Chinese will first support the Chinese electric car manufacturers or foreign ones like Tesla? China has TWO billion people and they are LITERALLY at the brink of converting the entire country into a highway system. Imagine when cars first came to America. That is whats going on in China and ALL of these cars will be electric. So the demand for RARE EARTH MATERIALS will go through the roof in which China WILL HAVE to ostracize all other nations and ONLY give their rare earth elements to their OWN electric car manufacturers period. Its common sense. Human behavior. Market behavior. Lets not be naive. But, we have been given a GIFT from the EV gods. MP. MP is the ONLY rare earth elements miners in the ENTIRE United States and heres the good news, they account for 15% of the entire world's rare earth elements!!! Without MP, trust me electric cars in the United States would be risky because we are 1000 percent dependent on China. But, MP takes us off the hook. With MP, we prevent geopolitical tensions between China and the United States. Oh yes thats where electric cars are going. Its no different than the missile race of the 80s between Russia and America. Ev cars are the NEXT big thing for economies because with EV we also must consider autonomous driving that would change the world. So EV is not just a green save the planet play. Back to MP. Our United States EV makers are sooo lucky to have the SECOND largest rare earth miner in the world to support the United States electric vehicle car makers! And the company is ALREADY profitable and growing like weeds. They are growth story that is already profitable with no debt!!!! As solid of a stock in this situation as you can get. But, yet....yet TWENTY PERCENT of MP stock is short. I've done zillions of hours of research where many think the Chinese are shorting it and many have other theories. And the EXPERTS in consensus continue to say you have to be crazy to short such a stock destined for greatness. MP protects us ALL in the United States literally. They are our protectors for the EV battle and race. And I hope we all can understand this. That without MP, electric cars in the US long term is a pipe dream. We need OUR VERY own to supply the United States with the ingredients (rare earth elements) to make EV vehicles. Without the mega success of MP, what happens if China tells are US electric vehicle manufacturers, \"sorry we are low on supply this year and we cannot provide you with the elements you need.\" That WOULD happen 1000% and it would send a shock to our ev markets. But, with MP we would never ever have a supply issue and hence because MP is our very own and with government subsidies etc- will help our own EV manufacturers to produce even cheaper. MP is a NATIONAL SECURITY play PLUS a phenomenal profitable company that LITERALLY has the largest rare earth mining in North America. YET IT IS SHORTED 20%......Folks TWENTY PERCENT......Now let's not be naive. Ask yourselves who would want MP to fail? Let's not be naive. Obviously this highly shorted tells me, someone is scared of MPs success and I believe its geopolitical. As Americans lets drive these shorts out of this PURE AMERICAN SECURITY company so MP can supply US EV MAKERS FOREVER! Lets burn the shorts here. And the stock is pure fundamentals as well.

{"text": "Again, disclaimer for the 9 million idiots who joined WSB since the new year, this is not a sq\\\\\\*ze play and if you\u2019re looking for one you can head somewhere else. \u200b #What is Autohome? \u200b Autohome is a Chinese holding company founded in the late 2000s that provides online platforms for dealers and people selling used cars. Their websites are a medium for car sales, used or new. They also profit off of advertising, financial services for these sales, and offer data analytical tools for sales and marketing solutions to their automaker and dealer customers. Their data products consist of automaker data products such as Intelligent R&D, Intelligent New Car Launch, Intelligent Marketing, and Intelligent Activities and end-to-end SaaS-based services to dealers, such as Intelligent Showroom, Smart DCC (direct call center), Smart Call Out, Smart Assistant, Smart Sales, and Smart Aftersales. Their market cap sits just shy of 10 billion, although I\u2019ll get more into their fundamentals later. \u200b #What\u2019s the case? \u200b Well first off, to give some context to the numbers I\u2019m about to throw out, here\u2019s a quick look at Autohome\u2019s \u200b 2-year chart, and their continued development of their apps/websites which Chairman of the board Quan Long (fantastic name by the way) discusses as important parts of the digital transformation taking place in the automotive industry. Their product development is about to be upwards of 50 million per quarter as they continue to roll out initiatives such as \u201cAI, Big data and Cloud capability, and SaaS strategies\u201d. \u200b Now you might ask why the stock is down so much in the context of the highs seen over the past 5 years, and for the love of god I hate to say it, but part of that was due to the spike you can see over January/February. Why, you might ask? Because people picked up that Autohome had a larger than average short position, every news site began releasing lists of companies prime to be the \u201cnext Gamestop\u201d, and the stock jumped. This happened to coincide with earnings, and when earnings came out and people realized Autohome wasn\u2019t selling the Nintendo switch and Pokemon plushies to greasy middle aged white men, the stock fell right back down to the previous range of hovering around 100 dollars per share. This downward momentum put a nice stain on earnings, and when Autohome released earnings recently in May, missing consensus EPS by 1 cent along with Chinese car sales dropping to 2019 levels due to Covid and the steel and chip shortage, the stock continued to fall down to where we see it today; with a consensus price target of $96.05. \u200b #Why I believe this is no longer a falling knife Autohome and its trendiness has just crossed over the EMA (exponential moving average) with a divergence of .63. While this alone does not indicate a guaranteed reversal, paired with other indicators (such as the substantial divergence between the current stock price and the 50/100/200 moving averages above) the MACD can be a great indicator of reversals. \u200b Autohome RSI \u200b Options: I currently do not own any options, though I plan on purchasing them this week. I\u2019d prefer not to say which options I\u2019ll be purchasing on this DD (though I\u2019ll most likely buy ones with September expiration), due to the high bid-ask spread, low volume/open-interest, and low number of options available leaving these options fairly open for a potential P&D, something I\u2019m not interested in.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-06-30 11:10:03", "id": "oal1p7"}

This is a buyout that only cost them 37$ million, so far, they have nine figures of cash in their balance sheet, which means the acquisition, didn't cost a lot of money for the Chef. The New Mexico facility in Albuquerque, currently produces Mexican foods, including quesadillas, burritos, and other hand-held items as well as sauces. The second facility in Karsten is brand new and will enable the company to have extensive tortilla manufacturing capabilities, as well as to be able to customize the existing footprint. This deal, it's going to increase revenue dramatically for Tattooed Chef and allowed them to basically get a ton more production, as they continue to expand into more and more stores, plus they get to control everything that goes into the product, to make sure it's near-perfect every single time. Tattooed Chef, launches vegetable products in Whole Foods Market nationwide. This is just the start of them getting into Whole Foods, and they might increase their presence there much more over time. Whole Foods is brilliant for branding, because it's seen as a high-end store, and you want to have your branding and your products there. It's very important for Tattooed Chef to have a relationship with Whole Foods because it is owned by $AMZN (Amazon) In this way, if Amazon has ambitions to get more and more into grocery, and in the future, more people are starting to order groceries online, then obviously you want to be in a position where you're in with the biggest online retailer in the world. \ud83d\udcf7 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude68 Sales are just booming for the company, increased 105% and revenue increased 59% to 52.7$ million compared to 33$ million the previous year in the same quarter. Tattooed Chef is growing rapidly especially within the food industry. Food companies usually when they're doing well, they're growing at like 20% - 30% type growth rates, it's hard to get 59% in the food and drink industry. Regardless of how good or interesting your products are, these numbers are absolutely extraordinary. \ud83d\udcf7 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude4b\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude68 Tattooed Chef, by the end of Q2, expects to be in an additional 1.162 stores, with 8.000 new points of distribution, including several large grocery chains. They are getting closer to their annual objective of 10.000 stores, and 65.000 points of distribution. The company has the opportunity in the future to go beyond just the freezer aisle, and get into more and more product categories over time. \ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63 This is a type of stuff you just love to see, if you own an expanding company in the food and drink space.

{"text": "Palantir. Love it. Hate it. You will never stop hearing about it. And here's why. Palantir was created for a world that didn't exist yet. A world where information and data would become so large no human workforce could ever be able to manage it effectively let alone, extrapolate insight from. So what's data do? It either sits there, or becomes a parasite on you for companies like google and facebook to target your dollars in the form of user specific ads. This way of utilizing data is indeed parasitic, and Palantir rejects this use of data in everyway possible. But what if data wasn't used to fuck over your own customers, but instead used to help save them money and resources. Perhaps their lives? Restore supply chains, accelerate cancer research, and help restore the world to (somewhat) normalcy post pandemic. The sophisticated tools required to manage this type of data would have been inconceivable. No one predicated this kind of disjunction. Well. maybe some, but no company that would sacrifice half their revenue in R & D to solve problems of this magnitude they may or may not come to fruition. No one. Except 1 company. Valued at less than 1 billion back in 2010, then up to 9 billion in 2013 and 20 billion in 2015. And as high as 41 billion right before becoming public. Palantir 40x in 10 years is impressive, but its total addressable market would suggest a runaway so large and growing so fast that those returns are far from over. How big is this market? Well. Looking at the S-1 Filings it's estimated to be 119 billion. This is broken down into 63 billion in government and 56 billion in commercial. This is less than a fucking percent. How fast is it expanding? Well the S-1 is old news in my opinion of the \"macrotrend\" that Alex Karp says is happening. This comes from COO Shyam Sankar himself... \"And -- and with our investments in the end-to-end, sensor-to-shooter workflows from space to mud, we're not just going after the roughly $60 billion of government IT spend anymore, we're talking about the quarter-trillion dollars of U.S. DOD weapons system spend in 2020.\" This is fucking huge. And is completely overfucking looked. Everyone is still looking at the S1 filings about PLTR's TAM and its just wrong, it's so far much more now. This is why perhaps that government revenue is actually picking up at a more rapid pace despite it being their main customer base to this date. Government revenue grew at 68% YoY in Q3 2020 and in Q1 2021 it was 72 percent (With US revenue at 83%). All-in-all I believe that a price to sales ratio of 40 is completely justified. This TAM is most definitely expanding into the commercial space as well. As IBM pointed out, 90% of all data has been generated in the last 2 years alone. This means that the data is growing faster then people can analyze it. This is where software like Palantir will be crucial in the future. What we're seeing with covid is all but just 1 example of how Palantir has been preparing for a future of disjunction. Palantir's investments only exacerbates the obviousness of the problem the large amounts of disperse data creates. They're putting their money where their mouth is by not only putting half of their revenue into R&D (561 Million, up 100% from 2018) but taking whatever's left over into data-intensive business startups that utilize Palantir software. These actions of SPAC investments are probably more or less on Peter Thiel's part considering he's created the Founder's Fund and has a track record of picking innovative companies. This doesn't suggest that Palantir is slowing down and that Palantir simply doesn't know where to put their money, but they're more or less trying to plant seeds in industries and sectors that they are wanting to penetrate. Not only could they see significant returns that startups that succeed bring about, but also an increase in reputation and a testament of Palantir's usefulness in that sector. They want to make examples like BP saving 50 million in the first 2 weeks to potentially a billion a year off using Palantir's software become the Rule and not the Exception to the Rule. Palantir's usefulness is not 'niche' but can be applied across any sector. I don't want to consider this DD as I barely did any research that I'm sure most of you guys didn't already know. My main point here is the counter argument to Palantir's valuation. And the skepticism surrounding its potential slow down in the future. In my opinion, Palantir and their competitors aren't growing as fast as the TAM and that's why I don't expect to see revenue both on commercial or government to grow slower than 45% in a couple years when the entire commercial sector will start to generate so much data that they'll have to switch to something new then their own built in piece by piece enterprise software that simply just doesn't work. This is the reoccurring problem Palantir has on it's sales side. It's not other software enterprise companies that they mainly compete with, but their own customers that try to build their own systems. If they can get this much revenue from less than 200 customers (not to mention that the top 20 customers continue to pay 30%+ more for their subscriptions on a YoY basis) then any fear of a slowdown should not be on your mind when deciding whether or not to purchase Palantir stock. My main concern for Palantir is ironically how much cash it has. I say ironic because Peter Thiel ripped in Googles cash hoard saying they aren't innovative enough to know how to use their 50 billion cash hoard. Now Palantir only has 2.3 billion cash but there market cap is much smaller than Googles back in 2012 when their massive cash hoard was addressed. (50 billion Vs Googles 270 billion). Now this cash hoard isn't nearly as severe and a drag as google's through the forces of inflation but it does pose some headwind if they cannot utilize it in innovative ways. Now Palantir has invested in 4 additional SPACs that I'm aware of since their ER (Perhaps 5, Idk if the \"partnership\" with Primer includes a PIPE investment) and perhaps we may actually see a decrease next quarter on their cash on hand which I'm not opposed to, as long as its being reinvested in some way. \u200b TLDR: Palantir may be a multibillion dollar company but the the billions of dollars spent on R&D are just now beginning to pay off as the macrotrends are beginning to point closer and closer to companies like Palantir to be the next solution to the next problems that will plague the world in the not too distant future.

{"text": "Dear fellow investors and apes, First of all, I'd like to highlight that I'm indeed a new account, so apologies to people that only trust \"buy and hodl to the moon\" comments/posts from old legit reddit users. Secondly, I already made a post where I highlighted several reasons why you should make a WISH and, if you haven't already read it, I suggest you do so as I will not repeat all the points on this post -> Why you should make a WISH: Aliexpress marketplace is probably WISH's most direct competitor and represents 86% of BABA's revenue Ebay (EBAY): Global marketplace but unlike WISH, people can also sell their items. Mercadolibre (MELI): Commonly called the \"Ebay of Latin America\" Poshmark (POSH): Marketplace to buy and sell new and secondhand cloths Jumia (JMIA): e-commerce platform similar to WISH but active in Africa Shopify (SHOP): Provider of commerce platform for merchants \u200b Fundamentals comparison Methodology: Comparing 1) \"fundamentals metrics\" such as estimated revenue growth, estimated EBITDA Margin and current Debt-to-EV; 2) \"valuation metrics\" such as estimated price-to-sales EV-to-EBITDA ratios. Estimations for revenues and EBITDAs are based on analysts forecasts from Bloomberg for 2025. (Note that POSH has forecasts until 2024 only). Results: WISH has estimated revenue growth and EBITDA margin lower than average but lower debt ratio. Assuming Ebay and Shopify are good proxies for a value and growth stock respectively, from a fundamental point-of-view WISH seems in-between. However strikingly t its valuation ratios are even cheaper than Ebay's ones. I believe that a discount in valuation is normal given its exposure to China and actual negative EBITDA, but the actual discount is just too huge compared to averages and companies in similar positions (JMIA and POSH). Valuation metrics based on estimated fundamentals instead of EV/expected EBITDA, as the latter would provide meaningless results for negative EBITDAs (similar to a meaningless P/E ratio for negative earnings). Evolution of estimated EBITDA yield and even the worst PT is above current price. What is also interesting to note is that analysts are bullish on the industry as highlighted by no sell recommendations at all (expect one for Shopify) and a majority of buys. Analysts price targets, revenue above ($772m VS $743m expected) and revenue forecast for Q2 below estimates ($715-730m VS consensus of $759m). I'd expect a drop in the price given the lower guidance compared to forecasts, however that day the company lost roughly a third of its value (though guidance was only 4-6% below). But guess what, the following day was precisely the end of the lock-up period and insiders could start selling their shares (check by yourself: IPO prospectus... Coincidence? Well I personally don't think so, market makers know very well this kind of information and given the important change in the float following the end of the lock-up (from 60m to 375m shares as shown in the following graph), I wouldn't be surprised if they kept lowering the price in order to buy shares from insiders at a wholesale price (in the end the market maker is indeed a wholesaler...) Recent price action VS float \\(green line\\). If that happens and with recent strong increase in volume, I believe that more buyers will join the party (institutional investors, momentum algos, etc).

{"text": "$CPNG - Coupang # \"Korean Amazon\" with limitless potential. Coupang is dominating the competition by delivering a next generation experience for retail e-commerce, consumer food services, and digital entertainment in South Korea. There is incredible growth potential ahead as Coupang expands beyond Korea and enters new sectors. Stock has room to run and very little competition. The global e-commerce market = $4.9 trillion in 2021. $6.4 trillion expected in 2024. Coupang reported net revenue growing 74% Y/Y in Q1. The company reaffirmed its solid growth after posting first-quarter results last month on May 12. The firm reportedly plans to enter the nation\u2019s travel sector. In April 2021, Coupang expanded into Singapore, the company's first overseas foray. On June 4, 2021, Coupang announced that they have started operations in Japan. Korea\u2019s e-commerce opportunity is growing at 20% compounded annually. It trails only China as the second-fastest growing region. Coupang\u2019s dominance suggests that it could become the next Alibaba. In the last seven years, the company invested in end-to-end integration. It has a fulfillment and logistics infrastructure giving Coupang a moat competitors will have a tough time crossing. The trust of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation made major investment changes in the first quarter by selling all their investments in Apple & Twitter and initiated a position in Coupang. \u200b Coupang was founded by Bom Kim in 2010. A student of Harvard University Free Returns within 30 days Rocket Fresh Rocket Fresh is a fresh food delivery service. Similar to Rocket delivery, Rocket fresh delivers fresh foods overnight. A significant number of restaurants use Rocket Fresh Coupang Eats Coupang Eats is a food delivery service alike Uber Eats. During the delivery, users can track their food real time. Covid related expansion has led to customer growth and retainment. Coupang Flex Coupang Flex is a service that provides temporary employment to anyone over 18 years old. People can choose the date they wish to work and their main work is delivery. Coupang Play Subscription-based video streaming service launched by Coupang in December 2020. \u200b Key Financial and Operational Highlights: Total net revenues increased 74% on a reported basis and 63% on a constant currency basis. Total Active Customers grew 21% year over year to 16 million and total net revenues per Active Customer was up 44% to $262 in the first quarter. Gross profit was $733 million in the first quarter, a 70% increase from last year. Short Interest 50.51M Short Ratio (days to cover) 9.44 Owned by Insiders (%) 2.51% Owned by Institutions (%) 83.94% Float 496.86M Takeaway Coupang is an undervalued stock. It is in the post-IPO phase, which will introduce near-term volatility. Strong quarterly earnings growth will win the most cautious investor. This is a stock that should perform well for investors. Position: 450 shares with an average price of 39.30 Note: I believe Korean dominance is priced in. Japan and Singapore will come online to provide substantial upside. The business combination of Amazon e-commerce and digital entertainment with Uber Eats services are highly attractive. I definitely believe Coupang will take over Asia as an all encompassing service provider of several services. There\u2019s essentially no limit to the various products they could provide. I know air travel is a focus for Coupang at the moment.

{"text": "First let me start out by saying I'm an APE who eats crayons but had to post this because this spot right here is the biggest, rarest, and last opportunity we apes have to buy in at these cheap prices. WallStBets know that if they let GME drop, from this spot here, the entire meme frenzy will die. This is 100% the next rip. Also, I absolutely hate fundamentals but this isn't a play based on that, but rather based on the momentum. Old heads don't see that and are still buying shares of the DOW on their quotrons. Now, let's look at the technicals. Here's where shit gets interesting... PRICE ACTION First off, we need to analyze the price action of GME and right off the bat we see a MASSIVE gap right at $305. Short sellers came in right at the $350 mark and beat it down because if it blew the top off this daily resistance at $326-350, we will absolutely moonshot to $400+. That is if however we transition from these irrelevant CLOV and BB stocks and roll over our gains into GME. \u200b Also, RSI starting to taper. Historically GME has sold off after every earnings call for the past two years so I'm not surprised to see a dip right here. The thing is however that GME absolutely crushed earnings. The previous gap at $210 just filled and we needed that in order to make a higher low. FIBS This spot right here is the single greatest Fib retracement I have ever seen. Hovering right at .618 otherwise known as the \"Golden Trade\". The support level we are bouncing off is in line with the fib levels almost to a T, so we can expect a reversal is coming. \u200b OPTION VOL Now the icing on the cake is the option volatility that is absolutely sky rocketing. You can see the slight dip in call vol when we had the fat dip and see it start to pick up when we hit the golden fib ratio and set the gap at 310. Let's also look at the put volatility which has been linear. This is due to the Hedge Funds shorting the fuck out of this stock doing everything they can not to let the redditors and tards win. Options contracts are expiring on friday and are being rolled over, so on monday we will see a new wave of price fluctuation and option pricing where the contracts for next week will begin to drop. If my theory is correct, more buyers will jump in at the cheaper call prices when GME is pumped on market open on monday when it starts looking to fill the $310 gap. \u200b PC RATIO Put call ratios look overall bullish and this call option right here stands out. a $4,000,000 call in July? That's big money and while these big institutions are shorting, the smaller guys and smaller firms are pouring money in. You can see that there are a couple of multi-million dollar call spreads and naked calls. The problem here is that your average tard doesn't have $3000+ for a naked call so that's why cheaper contracts will fill the gap. \u200b If you believe in the technical analysis and the fuck fundamentals revolution of stocks happening right now, this could be the biggest trade of the year. WallStBets is an organization that I believe will not go down without a fight, and I see them planning a massive rally with GME through their instagram and twitter pages. What you apes don't understand is that there is a hierarchy to everything, and the organizers of WallStBets are absolutely BANKING on the shit that is ripping. A lot of the retards buying can barely navigate this subreddit and see \"BUY GME CANNOT GO TITS UP\" on the front page and just let er rip with a $500 call on their Robinhood account expiring next week. At the end of the day, do your own due diligence. The stock is cheap right now and I'm definitely buying. I believe in WallStBets and I think this is only the beginning of the meme stock revolution, and that these events will be engraved in financial history.

{"text": "I'm just going to start this DD off by saying if you're looking for the disgusting little \"sqze\" word, then just keep it moving because I'm not going to waste my time with that. How is Corsair looking at the moment? Over the course of the pandemic, gaming has continued to explode. With half the developed world locked away in their houses coinciding with the release of the Xbox Series X and the PS5, it\u2019s no secret that online gaming has continued to develop into one of the most lucrative businesses in the technology sector. Every indicator of mobile, console, and PC gaming has been compounded: from Twitch streams, to console sales, to purchases of PC parts, everything\u2019s been pretty much nuts, but you all know this. The important thing here is that the pandemic is ending, albeit slowly and a little later than expected. This means that a significant amount of analysts have lowered their forecasts for the gaming industry as people get back out of their houses to go frolic in the flowers or whatever the fuck regular people do. This prevailing narrative has led to Corsair\u2019s stock hitting around 46 dollars per share in the beginning of February, and then sharply declining for the next 30 days to hit 31 dollars at the beginning of March. Since then, the stock has continued to bounce up and down in the range of roughly 30 to 34 dollars, save for a brief dip under 30 and the brief spike to the high 30s a week and a half ago. With 40 days until earnings, Corsair\u2019s stock looks as stable as ever and has seemingly priced in a severe reduction in growth. So, you might ask, why should you bet against the crowd? Because they\u2019re stupid.* Gaming isn\u2019t going anywhere, and that\u2019s clear to anyone who knows jack shit about gamers and people who game casually. Is the field going to shift while things open up? Certainly, and anyone who thinks it won\u2019t is kidding themselves. But let me tell you, purely anecdotally, every single person I know who purchased expensive consoles, new headsets, new gaming PCs, new games? They\u2019re absolutely still using them, because they\u2019re going to get their money\u2019s worth. Everyone out there who just dropped 1500 dollars on their new setup isn\u2019t just going to let it go to junk and stop gaming overnight. Sales might not see the type of explosive growth they saw during the pandemic, but there are a few reasons why they\u2019ll certainly keep rising. Reason Number 1: E-Sports E-Sports were actually somewhat negatively impacted by the pandemic, even with E-Sports viewers in the US rising by 70% in 2020. The industry itself, already a multi billion dollar industry, saw a string of cancellations across the world that put a halt to the fastest growing sport (yes, a sport, just go with it) in the world. E-sports is slowly going mainstream, with companies such as Red Bull, Honda, Coke, Kraft, Marvel, Mercedes, even the fucking Air Force sponsoring E-Sports over this past year. Forecasted to hit 474 million viewers In 2021, games such as Rocket League, CSGO, and League of Legends have drawn the attention of hundreds of millions of fans desperate for tournaments, competitions, records and streaming out the wazoo. The primary importance of E-Sports to Corsair in my personal opinion? Accelerating the growth of gaming and competitive gaming as a mainstream activity rather than something viewed by boomers as a waste of time. This industry\u2019s growth over the next decade will be explosive and Corsair is poised to profit handsomely off its growth. Reason Number 2: Summertime Gaming This section is going to be short and sweet. It\u2019s summer. School is out. Countless millions of children have suffered through another year of school, and though many were online a lot of pandemic, most kids went back to In-person school this past year. Now they\u2019re finally getting out, and ready to spend 3 months straight pissing in soda bottles and playing Fortnite and League until the capillaries in their eyes burst. Reason Number 3: Unemployment Stagnation Unsurprisingly, gaming sales experience huge success during times of high unemployment, because people need something to do, and thankfully gaming is a great way to sit down and lose 12 hours of your life without remembering that you\u2019ve got rent due in 2 weeks with negative 14 dollars in your bank account and no job. Good thing federal unemployment benefits are still pretty damn great, right? Some states may be gradually reducing these federal unemployment benefits and reinstating job-seeking requirements for these benefits, but that\u2019s to be expected in a reopening economy. However, if you hop on over to the United States Department of Labor statistics on Unemployment Insurance, you\u2019ll notice something funky: the decrease in unemployment claims has begun to stagnate, as available jobs is at a record high but tens of millions of people stay unemployed. This disparity is due to a variety of factors that I could write an entire other post about, but I\u2019ll leave it at this: from skills mismatch to federal unemployment benefits being higher than minimum wage in some cases means that the unemployment rate is going to stay above the pre-pandemic unemployment rate, and people will continue to game. Fundamentals Fundamentals are fantastic, I\u2019m not going to go into extensive detail but Corsair has a P/E of 20 ATM which solid for the industry and doesn\u2019t indicate significant speculation for the future, operating margin is great, and their market cap sits at around 3 billion on nearly 2 billion in sales and 150 million of profit. Their fundamentals have been explored to death in other posts so I won\u2019t continue to beat a dead horse, but just wanted to establish that their fundamentals are solid. Predictions for the future As I said before, earnings are in 40 days. To be honest, I\u2019m sick of trying to hop in right before earnings on every stock after a significant runup has already occurred and I\u2019m sure you all re too. So, in preparation for another round of fantastic earnings, I\u2019m getting in early this time. I believe that earnings will be fantastic once again beating analysts reduced expectations for the reasons listed above, with growth higher than many are expecting post-pandemic. The acceleration of E-Sports over this summer and fall will continue to drive the share price back into the high 30s soon enough, possibly even low 40s over the next 4-6 weeks. Given the slightly longer time frame, I\u2019ve bought a healthy mix of shares and leaps for the coming storm.

{"text": "Summary Rite Aid stock fell sharply after last quarter's results. Heavy debt an ongoing concern. Investor interest in bricks-and-mortar retail drug stores may rise. Stock due for a short squeeze. Since posting its fourth-quarter results, shares of Rite Aid (RAD) are trading in a tight range around its key moving average. With short-sellers circling RAD stock with a 16% short float, one would think that Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets would look at the turnaround pharmaceutical retailer more closely. Rite Aid should join Reddit\u2019s meme stock rally for two reasons: short-squeezing hedge funds and the company\u2019s name. Just as ContextLogic\u2019s (WISH) \u201cwish\u201d caught on, \u201cRight\u201d Aid may trend next in the sub-forum. Memes aside, investors may look at the company\u2019s upcoming quarterly earnings this week next. What should investors expect from Rite Aid? # Mixed Q4/2021 Results Last quarter, RAD stock slipped after posting anemic revenue growth of 3.3%. Same-store sales fell by 0.3% Y/Y. Sales in cough, cold, and flue-related categories fell by a disappointing 37%. With the stay-at-home order and working from home, customers were less likely to catch the cold flu. Now that Rite Aid is trading sharply below its $28 peak in 2021, the stock could come back from here. Management forecasted total revenue in the first quarter in the range of $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion. Retail pharmacy same-store sales will fall by between 7% and 9%. It will earn up to $10 million in the first quarter. The company set a low bar. If its earnings come in higher on June 24, the stock could catch Reddit\u2019s speculators quickly. Last week, Corsair Gaming (CRSR) and Rocket (RKT) both spiked higher. Neither stock shared any fundamental news that would explain the rally. CRSR and RKT stock have a short float of 6.5% and 17.7%, respectively. Unfortunately, both companies each have one major shareholder ready to sell the stock whenever it rallies. In fairness, Rite Aid has 61% institutional ownership. This could limit the stock\u2019s rally. Still, a brief jump would give speculators a quick profit this week. \u200b ## Opportunity Rite Aid\u2019s modest revenue growth is frustrating shareholders. Digitally enabled sales grew by around 170% Y/Y but did little to add to the 3.3% increase in revenue. Source: Rite Aid Q4 2021 Presentation The retailer refreshed its website and mobile app. It updated the exterior of over 1,200 stores. So, as the US regains control over the Covid-19 pandemic, store traffic may improve. Rite Aid hired new sales and account management to implement its go-to-market strategies. The soft peak flu and Covid are now behind. The company completed its remerchandising strategy. It cleared all inventory that was not turning over and not relevant to its target customer. Now, it may pivot its sales as it opens new flagship stores. Pharmacy growth is critical to the company\u2019s turnaround. \u200b ## Risks Amazon (AMZN) could renew its bid to dominate the drug pharmacy business. Walmart (WMT) may leverage its low-cost operating model and drive sales of drugs at its pharmacy. Given its barely $1 billion market capitalization, Rite Aid is nimble enough to respond. By comparison, Reddit\u2019s favorite stocks like GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC) trade at $26 billion and $30 billion market capitalization as of June 18. Still, debt weighs on RAD stock. As of Feb. 27, Rite Aid had $3.1 billion in debt: \u200b Source: Rite Aid Q4 2021 Presentation, Slide 22 ## Related Investments Income investors may consider Walgreens (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS) instead. Both stocks score well on both the profitability and value categories. RAD stock only scores well on value. Plus, RAD stock scores better on growth than its peers: \u200b \u200b Data from SA Premium Given their strong profitability, both Walgreens and CVS Health are dividend income champs. \u200b Above: Rite Aid shares rose by above 100% before crashing lower in April. Rite Aid does not pay a dividend and has a high debt-to-equity ratio. Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Bausch Health (BHC) are examples of drug companies I analyzed before. They have high debt. Their performance weakens when interest rates rise. \u200b ## Your Takeaway The brick-and-mortar retailers are on the verge of a comeback. In the drug store space, Rite Aid is the smallest among the three firms. Speculators should look at this stock once again.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-06-21 18:49:10", "id": "o4py5r"}
{"text": "TL;DR - ITUB making huge strides to be a clean/green FinTech in the world's fifth largest banking market (Brazil). Go green, make green, print green. Oh also they rode strong through covid, have beat earnings recently, and Brazil is primed for economic rebound from the pandemic. ^(That was a really long TL;DR and I apologize for that. I know some of you don't have the patience to string 20 words together in an intelligible fashion and that's why people like me exist; to string 20 words together into what appears to be an intelligent thought. Disclaimer: I have no idea what I'm doing and this is not financial advice.) Hello again apes, cows, 4th time ev enthusiasts, and iTub pre-orderers, # ITUB filed a 6K today with the SEC that contained a gem of an announcement for the company, a mega investment in a green future... Firstly, for those who have been inside larping on the internet all day, ITUB is a Brazilian mega bank (largest private bank) who has been repositioning themselves as a FinTech recently with much success. You can read another DD from my profile on the company or one of several others on this sub that are much better. Now for the green stuff, I'll let the 6K do the talking... \u200b $400 billion in green investments by 2025. That's about $150 billion annually invested into credit in sectors such as health, environment, infrastructure, etc. I've seen a metric fuck load of virtue signaling on here in the name of renewables and cow farts in the last 2 weeks and I love to see it. Here we have a fucking mega corp putting their money forward to encourage this in Brazil; a developing country market larger than most in the world. # \"That's great, what a bunch of tree hugging rainbow bears. Do they make money?\" Yes, they do; fuck loads. Brazil was a hot spot for the pandemic and they struggled for a long time getting their arms around it. They're one of the last major (by population) nations in the world to get back on their feet. Sounds like a great time to invest in the largest private bank in the country that's repositioning itself as a FinTech, right? Right. Earnings since covid: \u200b - Feb 2020: beat on revenue and meet on EPS \\- May 2020: full pandemic mode - miss on revenue and EPS \\- Aug 2020: nearly recovered on revenue, less miss on EPS than May \\- Nov 2020: nearly recovered on revenue, beat EPS - Feb 2021 & May 2021: Beats across the board, well ahead of the curve in Brazil # \"Yeah retard, they make money because they're huge. We can't gain anything here.\" Wrong - let me show you something.... A few weeks ago, big buyers started piling into call options just outside the money. These big players have been anticipating Brazil's recovery, are appreciative of ITUB's strategy to expand digital and financial services, and are almost always in position ahead of time. Take a look at just July call options: \u200b Similar stories in August at the $7 and $8 strike levels. September's are filling up too. The June FD warriors sitting at the $7 strike level are some kind of special, but these July's and August's are doable for a stock that's bouncing back along with Brazil as a whole. Bonus: the calls are still dirt cheap, under $0.10 in some cases. There have been massive whale buys in the last couple days, via level 2 data, in the range of 60,000 - 100,000 shares in some cases.

{"text": "TL;DR \\- Since before the first ape, our fates have been inextricably linked with our poop, and it's about time for a breakthrough in poop technology. \\- There's a popular saying with holistic medicine types, 'food is medicine'. Food becomes poop. Ergo, poop is medicine is the clear leader in the multi-billion dollar opportunity of poop-based medicine, with catalyzing data coming in the next few weeks. The McRib is back in a big way. Smart apes also use tools. Having capitalized on their first milestone, taking 35k to 270k in options, with further long term growth potential in oncology, inflammation, immunity, and more. They are also having an investor day presentation today here is a Cathie Wood Approved\u2122 microbiome therapeutics platform company developing a novel class of biological drugs. Their therapy for SER-109 in persistent bacterial GI infection (C. Diff) is nearing approval after a successful Phase 3, demonstrating that the company can deliver on less complicated applications for the technology and has the process and manufacturing to address more lucrative indications. Phase 2 of clinical trials is a pivotal de-risking milestone and is typically where most of the value of a clinical stage asset is realized. The upcoming readout for SER-287 in ulcerative colitis (UC) represents a substantial growth opportunity for MCRB, more than doubling the potential addressable market size. Published disease response rates were evaluated to construct a quantitative risk model in PYMC3 of positive results under stringent assumptions. Prior readout timelines and public statements about results \u201cmid-year\u201d point to announcement in July, gapping share price to ATH (\\~38$). The hype cycle may have come and gone on the microbiome field \\~2015, but the addressable markets are just getting ready for the disruption and Seres will lead the pack. Significance/Innovation If you don't think poop is an opportunity for cutting-edge health care technology, all it takes is constant bleeding out of your asshole to change that perspective. Chron's and Ulcerative colitis are miserable chronic illnesses, and apes are already paying out the ass for approved drugs with unreliable effectiveness. Modifying the gut microbiome is a highly effective 'black box' approach that has had a lot of development in basic, animal, and translational research. Changing gut microbial composition affects multiple disease pathways in a manner superior to current targeted drugs for complex pathologies. In the MCRB trial, 3 groups of 67 patients (Placebo, low dose, high dose) with mild/moderate UC failing standard of care (5-ASA, a non steroidal anti-inflammatory) were treated for 10 weeks and evaluated by endoscopy for response and remission. Placebo and drug effect sizes can be reliably modeled using available data, so risk of failure is well defined, and the company has been consistent on readout timelines of 7-9 weeks after completion. The computer says 'YOLO' To model trial success and failure probabilities in PyMC3, I reviewed published recurrence rates in randomized, controlled clinical trials of mild-moderate UC and estimated population means and 95% confidence intervals. For placebo, I used recent trials from a meta-analysis paper (Jairath 2017), treated group must be 53/67 or less to qualify). After hitting the magic inference button a few times and tuning the sampler hyper-parameters, a few key posterior predictions/probability density functions are: mixed patient-level recurrence probability (failure, UC flares up again within 10 weeks, a), total recurrences at the Treated Group level (b), and empirical trial failure probability after applying the 10% cut-off for difference in % remission (c). Business logic Assessing risk also involves understanding the non-public information and decision making behind the scenes. Interim/partial data analysis is standard practice for clinical trials, how a company uses this early evaluation of at the data is highly informative. This part is also a bit of Bayesian logic, but this time we're doing it in our heads. Previously, Seres Therapeutics demonstrated that they will use an early stopping option to discontinue trials that are not likely to succeed (ECOSPOR II), saving them time, money, and effort. They've also never blown their load by publishing a positive interim readout like some companies, choosing not to disclose data from the successful repeat of ECOSPOR II at all. We've long since passed the early stopping point for this trial, so we can conclude that the internal information points towards success. Management has demonstrated they are science-first and don't play games with the stock price by manipulating disclosures. I have extreme confidence in the company leadership and development approach, they have been diligent and systematic about forward progress so far and I expect that to continue. Conclusion The risk model is very conservative, a significant proportion of patients could end up non-responders and low-responders and the trial remains a success with room to spare. The risk/reward ratio is off the charts and timing remains the largest source of uncertainty. My positions: 200 July calls are good for realizing day-of, 50 August is a hedge against time-line risk and potentially more upside than July if held till expiration.

{"text": "Title above says it all, just hoping to get some insight and discuss the possible reasons why this might or might not be a good play. I'm sure many of you have noticed (or maybe you haven't) that almost all banks residing/operating within the U.S. have been taking some heavy hits these past 6 months from a chart standpoint. Sure from a yearly standpoint they're absolutely killing it, most US banks are up $5, $12, even $20 and most Q1's of this year for most US banks were some of the best quarterlys they've posted in decades, but from my point of view this all seems to be tapering off and this excess success seen in the past year seems to be (and maybe obviously) driven by the pandemic and the abnormal year we had during 2020. From a 3 month perspective a lot of these gains are still positive but they're like a 1/3rd of what the yearly gains were and for some banks (mostly smaller ones like: First-midwest, Citigroup, Fifth Third Bank] the positive gains and momentum they were having have started turning negative by like $2, $3, $5+ in some cases and others are just breaking even by the cent and to me it seems like the small banks are bleeding out a little faster than the bigger guys, but I suspect the big banks to follow suit due to a lot of monthly and now weekly gains for almost all banks are turning negative as well by again $2, $3+. I've personally been following U.S. Bank (USB) the most because I personally Bank with these guys and have been seeing some odd discrepancies on an internal side that don't necessarily match with what they're saying on a public/more formal side. I reside in Iowa and U.S. Bank has been closing down a lot of their branches over here and I've received emails from U.S. Bank stating that the company is going through various changes and restructuring at the moment and that they'd like to have a financial meeting with me to discuss the nature of these changes to assure me that U.S. Bank still has a bright future. U.S. Bank will probably post a good Q2 this July, its going to be higher than their Q2 last year but it's going to be much lower than their Q1 of this year, analysts estimate Q2 of this year to be around .45 cents whilst Q1 of this year was upwards of a $1, I just personally feel like Q3 of this year will be lower than Q2, am I wrong in my thinking/line of logic and understanding here?

{"text": "Gather round the campfire kiddo's - let me tell you about Good Ole' Grandape Foley. Many know the merits of Grandape Foley, but lots of you young monkey-like, natural resource handed savages may not. So let me paint the picture for you. You think you have hands of Diamond? Well let me tell you.. Grandape Foley has diamond hands of the highest kind. Carats so large he doesn't only drag his knuckles, his forearms scrape the floor too. Here are some fun facts about Grandape Foley that will explain the legend behind the Ape. \u200b He's 76 years old and still kicking wall street bankers in the dick. He does things his own way and builds empires with his glorious diamond hands mostly from scratch. I'll touch on that below. He was born 4 months and 16 days before Hitler died. 4 days short of a 420. Coincidence? I think not. As a young ape he lived in Texas, papa and mama ape Foley were ranchers (simple folks trying to make a living). He didn't have a silver spoon in his mouth and he built everything he has from scratch. He played something called Shinny before your daddy and mommy were out of grade school. Did I mention he wound up losing it all. Sounds like one of us. (One of us! One of us!) He went to the Air Force and left after getting bored of negotiating multi-million dollar defense deals with Boeing. Grandape Foley had other goals in mind. So, he took his diamond hands and diamond balls and got into business... Foley got involved with Fidelity National. Back when they were only doing $6m a year in revenue and grew the fuckin' thing to a current $90B market cap. Let that sink it. Diamond hands if I've ever seen any. Grandape Foley is building his legacy, from scratch, everything he touches turns to gold with those glorious diamond hands. Fast-forward a bit and here's what he does next: \u200b Remember when I told you he played Shinny (informal ice hockey w/ a fucking broomstick). Well he developed a lifelong passion for Ice Hockey. So what does a rich, self-made ape do with his money and passion for Ice Hockey? Well, he buys an NHL team of course.But this isn't just any old regular ape schmo we're talkin' about here. This is Grandape Foley. He doesn't just buy the best team in hockey and take over the league. That would be too easy. Nope, he starts a new team, from scratch. In 2017 Grandape Foley brings the Las Vegas Golden Knights into the NHL and in their 2nd year they're already in the finals for the Stanley Cup. They didn't win, but that's likely because Foley wasn't on the ice with his broomstick. And now the most important part in the legend of Grandape Foley. All the while, he's been building an almost silent iGaming Empire. And if there is anything we can learn from all of this, it's that Grandape Foley is a winner! He took PaySafe (PSFE) public around 6 months ago to not much fan fare. But Grandape Foley doesn't give a fuck. He's been silently moving his big balls all-through the iGaming industry making large strategic moves. Grandape Foley once said it was hard to handle poker chips in his hometown of Vegas because they fall out of his diamond hands. So he's envisioning an entirely chipless casino industry, in person and legally online. While everyone is focusing on digital coins and old outdated movie companies getting eaten alive by Netflix. Foley is building a new world in iGaming and doing it on the back of PSFE. Here's some more DD on Grandape Foley incase you haven't heard: \u200b He invested $100M in a 'strategic' move in sightline payments. and Wynn (a large casino in and around Vegas)... hmmm... Finally and most importantly what caused me to YOLO hard into PSFE From one Diamond handed ape to another, ask yourself... Why would Foley who is 76 years old, has all the money in the world and owns a major winning sports franchise waste his time messing around with PSFE and all the strategic plays if he didn't think this was going to be his biggest deal yet, and maybe his life legacy? I believe it will be. I believe he knows exactly what he's doing. You don't go from playing 'Shinny' with a broomstick on thin ice and milking cows to becoming a multi-self-made-billionaire if you don't know what you're doing. I'm betting on good ole' Grandape Foley. \u200b", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-06-26 04:33:35", "id": "o7sg8v"}

MNDY - Proof that tech IPOs are almost as retarded as we are Today, MNDY went public. For those of you that don't know what it is, MNDY is Monday.com, a workplace and project management tool. Currently these are the stats: Price: $155 (originally pegged at this price - peaked at $180 at open. Truly retarded shit.) Mcap: $6B Revenue: $236M projected for 2021 Net Income: -$121M EBIDTA: -615% Rule of 40: -47 YoY Growth:136% So now you're saying \"Wait Fudgie, I'm retarded and I don't know how to make my own decisions, tell me what this means\". You're in luck. What this means is that this company is burning cash, makes negative money, has a dogshit rule of 40 rating and only has massive YoY growth because 2020 was a layup for any tech company that has a partially functioning workplace management tool. Like most companies that saw crazy growth last year, they're gonna get fucked in a few quarters once people start going back to their offices. Having used Monday at my last 2 companies, it's cool, but it's just ok. Nothing special whatsoever. The biggest metric to prove how fuckered this stock is in the near term is customer retention. They have an annual dollar expansion of 26%. Sounds pretty dope right? Fuckin killer. These guys are really growing their customer base. Wrong. They have an annual dollar churn of -24%. This means that based off of these metrics they're only growing at a 2% rate on their existing business. Having worked in tech my entire career I can tell you that that means that they're fucked. If you're being valued at crazy multiples the way they are you can't have shit retention like that otherwise you're fucked. So we have a company that's barely growing existing customers and only has YoY growth because of COVID and it's grossly overvalued by at least 50% seeing as they're most recently private valuation put them at $4B and they're IPOing today at $6B.

Depop was valued at 23 price to sales vs POSH which is currently at 12 price to sales \\-------------------------------------- There are several short squeeze plays out there but its has been a lot of fun. Reddit has changed the game and has brought shorts to their knees through perseverance and true retardation. Now it is great that Reddit has moved stocks and that the actual company has been given a second chance at life due to the frenzy. But what is even better is buying a growing company that will be able to take advantage of the changing consumer behaviors of Gen Z. I.E. Posh Mark Now I have been bullish on POSH for several months after I read some very good DD on WSB and then speaking with my younger family members who absolutely love the app. Now I know that most of you are male, millennials and virgins which are not exactly the key Poshmark demographic. But I can almost guarantee if you speak with the younger generation you will find there is a deep love for the app and that the average user spends more than 27 minutes a day on it. \u200b Fundamentals There are several key macro factors that play into the Poshmark story. First, more and more Gen Zs are entering the workforce and are rapidly gaining spending power and they are also influencing their parents buying behaviors with 85% of parents saying their children influence their purchases according to 2019 National Retail Federation survey. Furthermore, a study by Bain found that 60% of Gen Z's consumer behavior is influenced by reducing their environmental footprint and is a top reason they gravitate to resale companies. They are also driven by purchasing goods at discounted prices. Second, they are the largest player in a growing market space. The second hand/ resale market is expected to grow to over $64 billion by 2024 just in the U.S. and is expected to grow at a 39% annual rate between now and then. Poshmark currently operates in the US, Canada, and Australia. They have international expansion in mind meaning they have not even scratched the surface of the total addressable market. Third, the shift towards social commerce. For you that don't use the app, it feels like a social media app that allows you to shop for goods. This keeps buyer and sellers addicted to the platform and is why the time spent on the app is over 27 minutes per day per user. The average per instagram user is 30 minutes. The social media feel of the app also provides current and future opportunities to provide a platform for influencers to market within that app, which is a large driver of consumption with Gen Z. Fourth, POSH runs an asset light business model where they provide a platform to bring sellers and buyers together for a fee. Now this is important fro several reasons but the most important point is that their model is extremely scalable. POSH is a market place that does not hold inventory. This model requires little to no large capital expenditures when expanding into different countries or adding products on the platform like pet, home-goods, and baby products. This gives them a competitive advantage over competitors like Thread Up. Valuation Depop was recently acquired to by Etsy for $1.6 billion. In 2020 Depop had $70 million in sales from 30 million users in 150 countries. They were valued at 23 price to sales multiple Vinted another reselling app was just valued at $4.5 billion with a 13 country and 45 million user base in the most recent funding round POSH had 262 million in sales in 2020 and is currently valued at 12 price to sales ratio. They have operations in 3 countries with about 6.5 million active users. They also have about 15% market shares of the resale market with $1.1 billion of gross merchandise value. What does this mean? It is evident that POSH has a more loyal valuable user base because they are able to monetize their users more effectively with each active user contributing $40 to the top line vs Depop which only earns $2.33 of revenue from each active buyer. POSH has only penetrated 3 countries leaving hundreds of million users yet to be reached. Just comparing the price to sales of POSH and Depop, POSH should be trading at least 2x higher. There are other factors like future growth in the US and internationally The stock and technicals Now that stock IPO'd at over $100 and was quickly shorted into oblivion and bottomed five months later at $33. It has recovered since then but still has a short % over over 28%. The float on POSH is about 15 million and the SI is about 4.33 million shares according to Ortex and has been growing ever since the IPO. The cost to borrow has been slowly creeping up to 3.66%. The utilization rate has been above 80% for the past week and hit 100% last week meaning there are very few shares left to short. There were 3mm shares short when the stock bottomed last at $33 last month. The stock is currently trading at $45 so there are likely several shorts underwater. The volume is super low on this stock with 520k shares on average traded over the past two weeks. This leaves the days to cover ratio at 8.3. This is also puts the shorts in a bad position where they are unable to close out their positions without sending the stock flying. To expand on this point any buying pressure or positive catalyst will send the stock flying as well. \u200b \u200b The catalyst Currently since the volume is so low they cant close their shorts without significant price movement to the upside. What they are banking on is a large chunk of newly available shares to close their positions after the share lockup expiration on July 12th. This could serve as the catalyst for the stock to jump higher if insiders do not sell. The stock will jump as the short sellers will have to purchase shares from the existing low float and volume to close. Personally, I do not believe insiders will sell at these levels for two reasons. One, the macro trends in consumer behavior are favorable to their business model. If POSH can maintain their current market share of around 15% and the market for resale goods hits $64 billion in three years POSH could easily hit over $1.5 billion in yearly sales by 2024. If you were to apply a price to sales of 6 which half of the current P/S you would have a market cap of 9 billion and this does not even include sales from the established market of Canada and growing market of Australia or any other market they decide to move into. So why would I sell my shares today if it will be worth at least 3 times more in 3 years? Second, their stock IPOd at $42 and jumped to over $100. The stock is only trading at $45. If i knew that someone was willing to pay over $100 six months prior why would I sell in the 40s. This is similar to what happend to Doordash which jumped 14% on their lock up expiration. The POSH chart also looks very similar to LMND pre lock up. LMND ran from 60 to 181 after their lock up expiration Overall, POSH is in a solid position to take advantage of changing consumer behaviors and will easily be a 3 bagger if not more in three years. In the short term, the July 60c are trading around .45 This stock could easily rise to $65 or 70 if there is any sort of positive catalyst or reddit induced buying pressure. POSH announced a partnership with Snapchat that shot the stock up 50% in two weeks. If it were to go to $65 by July exp it would be a 10 bagger. The stock might jump that high if insiders do not sell their shares which I believe is the likely scenario or another positive announcement. Position 6000+ shares and some July 60c and Aug 70c \u200b Edit: added short term out look.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-06-23 07:25:57", "id": "o5wfgg"}

{"text": "Alright retards. Throwback to a prior WSB starlet. TDOC is where it's at. Cathie Bae owns 16M shares. Vanguard owns 12M shares. BlackRock at 5.5M shares. These legends on different ends of the investment spectrum on the same page? Madness. Current price as I write is \\~$160 / share. All analyst targets anywhere I can see show low of 162 and high of 300. CATHIE BAE's cost average is basically the CURRENT PRICE... so you're not missing the boat here by any means. TDOC fell off a cliff in March as the world started opening up and vaccines rolled out - dropping from \\~280 all the way to \\~140. Classic over-reaction. Behind it all? Fundamental concern that \"telehealth\" is a COVID stuck at home thing and not the future? Some speculation of Amazon being a healthcare player in the future? Peepz investing in COVID recovery stocks? (that last one is understandable... but winding down as a strategy) The reality is TDOC is taking healthcare by storm. Healthcare is one of those industries that is decades behind technology-wise... super archaic systems, paper documents, antiquated everything. For anyone who has had the misfortunate of working in healthcare like myself it's a bit of a cluster. The tech driven health industry will be growing like crazy as big companies modernize and new players enter the market. TDOC has a massive lead, fantastic market penetration, and great overall financials. Revenue increased like crazy during COVID and is still on a solid growth trajectory. P/E good. Overall just a very solid play. Back to Cathie Bae. She has been increasing her position for ages. It is second only to TSLA across the ARK funds... but TSLA is one of those things in the limelight that has already been pumped like crazy. Room to rebound and continue growing? Probably. I'd argue TDOC's potential in the next 6 months is greater because it is beginning to climb out of a 50% drop that was largely unwarranted. TDOC acquired Livongo and has the footing in this quickly evolving industry to continue expanding offerings and building on the market penetration it's already established.

{"text": "TL:DR; buy SPY puts: ITM if you're nervous, OTM LEAPS if you're up for it THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE - If you don't know what you're doing, don't read this. OK, long story short, we're headed into bear territory, and you want to be ready. If you don't believe it, great, just wait longer. EDIT: To make sure any newbs understand: all of these are 3X leveraged ETFs, which means they will experience DECAY. So please, if you're not sure what you're doing, either play things very short-term (weeklies or so) or just short SPY if you're desperate to play the game. \u200b 1. $UVXY Calls. The VIX (volatility index) jumps the most with market downturns. It's the fastest, easiest way to make money outside of a 0DTE SPY put. There are two options for VIX calls that are easy for the average ape: $UVXY and $VIXY. Both of these are VIX ETFs. Having done too much research and comparing between these two, I found UVXY to be the better of the two. It responds to the market faster and climbs higher faster.Buying $UVXY call at the ONSET of a bear market is the first move. 2. $SOXS Calls. The next best call is for $SOXS. SOXS is an ETF bear on semiconductors which I've found hurts the worst at the ONSET of a bear market, but stabilizes after a few weeks or months (depending on the severity of the fall) due to semis have real assets. There are a few more options a little further down, but they don't react as well to the downturn in the short term. 3. $SPXU Calls. While SOXS lasts nicely for abou the first 10-15% of a downturn (in time) the value of the semiconductor stocks levels out due to real assets. This means the next thing to cash in on is $SPXU. $SPXU is a 3x Bear ETF on the S&P500. It responds better than $SQQQ at the outset, so it's better to have at the front end of the downturn. 4. $SQQQ Calls. After about a month or two, $SQQQ starts to outperform $SPXU. So if you're playing this week-by-week, you'll want to switch up from $SPXU to $SQQQ. It takes a while to get going, but when it does, it really ramps better than $SPXU. It's basically the same thing by a different name. 5. $TWM Calls. $TWM is a Russell 2000 3x Bear ETF. Calls basically don't exist, but when the market tanks, these puppies fly. 6. $SPY Puts. The classic. Best way to make/lose money in a flash. Highly recommend 0dte puts if you're feeling it and the IV is below a ridiculous number. Some strategy: OK, if you're not sure what you're doing, just buy some LEAPS of $SPXU calls. Meaning, buy out to Jan 21 or something. If nothing happens, you lose 10-20% and you can bail... If you're in for this hard-core, add these tickers to your watchlist, and buy some 06/25 $UVXY calls ASAP.For those who are risk averse: buy about $2 ITM calls. For those who are feeling frisky, buy about $2 OTM calls. I have no clue how bad the market will tank, or when. No freaking clue. But it will, and it will big time. Buy $UVXY calls now, $SOXS calls now, $SPXU calls soon, $SQQQ calls later and play $SPY shorts along the way. My Positions:06/25 $UVXY $28/$30C ($20 was on the money when I bought it)06/25 $SOXS $8C06/25 $SPXU $20C07/26 $UVXY $36C07/26 $SPXU $2xC01/22 et al I have more positions than this, but there are to many to list.

{"text": "EDIT 6-17: Market rallied tech as growth was flooded after news that rates were not increasing. This doesn't change the thesis, the next meetings will continue to project earlier rates as inflation absolutely won't be contained at this rate, and paper leveraged growth stocks are going to feel the pain the most after the quad witching tomorrow. Here are the HRC futures updated for today. HRC prices June 17 and why it's not just \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 to the moon, but to a whole new damn universe - of inflation and summer tendies. Some of you dipped into $CLF last week but we're going further. We Marvel multiverse now (ps Loki sucked ass). United States Steel Corporation a.k.a. $X steel, is the oldest steel producing company in the U.S., and 2nd largest behind Nucor Corporation ($NUE). It was founded by J.P. Morgan, Charles Schwab and other rich ass wall street boomers in early 1900s. With an unstable market ahead due to inflation and fear projections, here are reasons why this boomer company older than Buffett himself is your fix of Pepto Bismol and Xanny combined, as Hot-Rolled Coil steel prices continue its All Time High run into the summer: *\\\\Short Interest\\\\ Find it yourself, I don't care about it. Not here to pump short squeeze FOMOs, $X will print like the Fed in 2021 without it. \\\\EV demands\\\\ This one is simple. You know what all your Tesla or $WKHS or other EV companies with 10,000% revenue increase projections by 2025 with 0 production in 2021 need? Batteries, semiconductors, engineers and some CEO Steve Burns on TV saying \"wE DiDnT aCtUaLLy HaVe OrDeRs LoL\". But you know what ALL Vehicles need? STEEL. In the wise words of $Xzibit, X gon'... Raise prices. \\\\Market Sentiment - Put/Call Ratios\\\\ [ Refer to X put/call ratios in July. Even in June, while SPY is sideways or bearish, X bulls are simply greater in number than bears. If money rolls in anywhere in this summer, it's going to be in commodities that benefit from the rampant inflation in the meantime. Steel. \\\\Learning from History\\\\** [ [ Domestic steel companies - NUE, CLF, X so on - are in coalition to maintain control of the supply so they don't repeat history. What history you ask? US Steel stock peaked exactly 13 years ago in June 2008, along with many other steel stocks, then proceeded to fall off a cliff due to the 2008 financial crisis stemming from overleveraged greedy ass wall street banks getting defaults on their mortgage gambles. This was amplified by the fact that steel production was at 90% capacity for these companies all jumping in to take advantage of the bubble that had formed, raising HRC prices to then-All-Time-High of \\~$1000. Needless to say, steel tanked after and they learned their lesson. You can bet your ass they won't let that happen again to remain ridiculously profitable post-inflation. [June 2 HRC futures stock is relative. Things are better for the company than they have been in years, but the analyst simply likes other stocks better. His price target is \\\\$41\\\\, above where shares are trading.\" Above $CLF. He knows. \u200b Technicals \\- Here's some charting back 9 months on $X and $CLF (orange line) compared - From the technicals, my findings are as follows: [X and CLF compared charts, 9 months to CLF, and maintains the lead. That will continue. CLF goes up, X will rise harder. More upside. 2 indicates the run-up pre/post earnings. Most steel companies report earnings at a similar time. CLF will be the next one in mid-July. Imagine steel companies continue trading sideways while their predominant steel product in HRCs rise to new ATH's in a recovery summer with infrastructure plans on the horizon and severe supply shortages. Can't? Me neither. Pleas fly again. 3 leading up to 4 in yellow circles are the market pullbacks in May, triggered by worse-than-expected CPI report. Remember last month? PLTR bled all the way down to $16, digital currency took a massive 50% hit from ATH, and Cathie Wood was no longer giving you wet dreams. But X steel? 24% dip down to $23.40 level, bought up immediately again within the week. Now, chilling on the resistance. 4 is resistance. Even on bloody days, X refuses to dip below \\~$25.75 and $25.40. It's there right now as I type. Apart from that bloodbath in May, X does not dip below that channel in the two-month chart. Yesterday, it hit this mark again - market bled and X hit this resistance for the 10th time in 2 months. And I am about $35k USD certain that it's ready to bounce to a new high. Inflation is real, so where does money go? Hold cash and lose money? Lol, no. \"Guarantees\". Bonds/Trusts. Cyclicals. Companies that make money. X is going to make some damn money this year. Where does JP Morgan want to put their $500 billion?( \"Steel is a generational opportunity\" their words. X had lower earnings during the pandemic compared to CLF, but reported higher earnings (Adjusted EBITDA / EPS) in Q1 2021. As X has higher margins, assets and debt overall, US steel has a lot more room for recovery/growth than other steel stocks, which it is primed to obtain AND beyond at this rate. The Return of the King is in the works. X has dividends. It's small, but a company to post one of their most profitable years in history with raised guidance after a shares offering will likely return something to shareholders. RKT special $1 dividend? Torchlight Energy special preferred A dividend share? Not sure. Expecting something on this front towards their earnings next month however. Price targets by analysts don't matter and often, I'm more tempted to sell than buy depending on the coverage. But JP Morgan along with other banks are hoarding literal billions in cash due to QE, inflation and low rates, and they won't sit on it for long, they're going to buy in, if not already. They are smart money after all. Here are the price targets for $X. \\-Credit Suisse - $35 May 4 \\-Morgan Stanley - $32 May 17 \\-UBS Group - $30 June 4 \\-JP Morgan - $41 June 16 (yesterday) \\-Goldman Sachs - $25 April 9 - this is outdated and will update by end of this month probably. No way we see below $30 in July IMHO. Thus, upside potential is higher for X. Among American steel stocks like $CMC, $NUE, $SCHN, $STLD, $CLF, and $X, US steel ran the least Year-to-Date (+50.51%). X steel also had the highest of highs among Steel stocks in '08. [Steel Armageddon '08 was lower than X's volume of \\~21m(9% float), despite having double the available shares. X moves more swiftly and momentously than you can expect of this boomer. I imagine X's volume to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 heading into July without a doubt. They are THE United States Steel after all, soon to post historical earnings in a commodity boom. \\\\2. The United States Steel Corporation. US Steel. Ticker -X-.\\\\*** Fucking X. Understand? I own $X, and if it ain't worth just for the sexy-ass ticker and OG status, I don't know what the hell I would want to invest in this summer. The possibilities are endless. What's an eXit strategy?

{"text": "I\u2019ve been following and participating in the cannabis industry for almost 10 years now and have witnessed the landscape change drastically. My insights from participating in the culture along with experience in marketing and brand strategy have brought me to the following conclusion. WeedMaps is NOT just a tech company with an app (which will be revamped soon). They are NOT just the \u201cYelp or Amazon\u201d of weed and they are NOT just a tool for dispensary\u2019s to gain attention. If this is all you see, your missing a very key aspect of their business - and that is their ability to drive, maintain and excel the cannabis industry as a whole. They have already proven to be a profitable with the current business model under strict regulations but they will really flourish when we start to see more media, events, and eventually consumption lounges - all curated and executed by WeedMaps. They will also be a key brand leading the fight for social justice reform within cannabis. I can\u2019t stress enough how incredible their potential is for taking over not just Cannabis media in silos or within the confines of their app, but instead a full blown, mainstream take over. Documentaries, Cooking shows, commercials, behind the grow episodes, and eventually full fledged original movies. Events will be huge in the sense that they will enable consumers to experience cannabis in a whole new way with regulation loosening. They will infiltrate the entertainment and music industry to help catalyst the brand awareness while growing and maintaining relevance. The skys the limit for WeedMaps as a tech company alone, pair this with the roadmap to media, events, and eventually lounges? It\u2019s game over.

{"text": "Alright degenerates, how many times have your FDs expired worthless and left you recording your wife getting blown out for the weekend by her favorite day trader bf. Cause personally it's been far too many times for me and that's why I have developed a plan to finally make enough tendies to retire off of. Fuck squeezes I've had it with those DDs and honestly, I don't think buying a stock bc another idiot dumber than you told you about the new Tesla he bought with AMC tendies is a good investment thesis. Instead, I want to invest in something real, something that has a backbone in the actual world that isn't empty movie theaters, and that something is the TESLA your fellow ape just copped. Back in the day (1 yr ago) when there were only 1 million retards instead of 10, an individual known as u/WSBgod showered us with his glorious TSLA gain porn. Today I am going to tell you why and how you can get your own glorious TSLA gain porn and finally fuck your own wife for once. \u200b DD: The only reason TSLA has the market cap it has today is the potential it has in the autonomous driving market. If TSLA was only priced for cars it sold it wouldn't be a multi-billion dollar company, worth more than every other automaker. This is because TSLA isn't just an automaker and realizing this will be your greatest asset. High conviction in a stock strengthens the diamond hands holding it! Anyway, Musk himself believes that when they solve FSD (Full Self Driving) and update all their cars overnight to be able to drive autonomously that TSLA will see the largest overnight asset increase in history. IDK about you but that sounds way better than a squeaker screaming \"squeeze\" about the latest stock they saw on somebody's shirt. Elon has reiterated in earnings calls that he is extremely confident they will solve FSD this year and my own knowledge of watching FSD driving videos they have now along with Elon saying the next new update has 100s of improvements and is supposedly coming out this month tells me that autonomy is much closer than most people realize. TLDR: FSD --> Stock to the Moon DD: Pretend everything I just told you is a lie and TSLA never has autonomous driving ever, is the company now worthless? No. TSLA announced and showed on their Battery Day all the manufacturing and engineering improvements they made to producing batteries which reduce the battery cost by almost 2/3rds (66%). They already have a pilot plant of these new battery cells along with new battery production plants being build at their new Gigafactories in Austin and Berlin. Hopefully, by now you can tell the world is transitioning to sustainable energies and EVs are becoming much more prevalent across society. All the EVs made by other car companies will require battery packs to make and operate. The only problem is these other car companies do not have the battery technology that TSLA has. Currently, TSLA is unable to produce cars like the SEMI due to a lack of batteries as they wish to prioritize vehicles with a smaller battery pack like the 3 and Y. Once they get all their battery plants online they will produce more cars than they ever have, along with SEMIS and CYBERTRUCKS. Other car manufacturers will run into the problem TSLA is in right now. They will not have the batteries to produce all the vehicles they want to make and if they try buying excess amounts of batteries that are 200% more expensive than the batteries TSLA is using they will not be able to keep up in margins/ pricing. ( This is why the high-end F-150 Lighting is more expensive than the high-end Cybertruck) TLDR: Batteries --> Stock to the Moon DD: Pretend everything I just told you is a lie and TSLA never has autonomous driving and they blow up all their own battery facilities, is the company now worthless? No. TSLA has all the top engineers in the world working for them (this is an underrated aspect of the company in my opinion) and they employ these engineers to do whatever they need to be done. One important team working for TSLA right now is the AI team. TSLA is currently in the development of DOJO, a neural net trainer. I'm not gonna pretend to know everything about this because it is way beyond my realm of understanding but what I do know is that AI runs on DATA. The more data you have to train your NN, the smarter your AI is. Currently, TSLA has the largest data lead as their cars have billions of miles driven on the road whereas the runner-up of Google's Waymo has a laughable millions. When DOJO is available TSLA will be able to train its NN with all its data which will result in the best autonomous driving technology available. Beyond training FSD, Dojo can be used to train any NN that Tesla or other companies will have uses for. Dojo is one of the most valuable assets for AI that will exist and that should be valued extremely high in my opinion as I believe AI will be the next largest breakout in society. TLDR: AI & DOJO --> Stock to the Moon \u200b The crazy thing about this DD is that I still haven't covered many of Tesla's massive opportunities such as its entire energy business or the future MODEL 2 that will eventually come out. Note that the MODEL 2 is a 25k Tesla which after factoring in the cost savings and any EV incentives that may come out will be the most affordable and best EV for its price and utility. (will hopefully be autonomous as well) I think basically anyone with a brain will buy the MODEL 2 and it'll kinda be like Apple unveiling the iPhone. Basically, everyone uses an iPhone for their phone now and I think once an EV like the Model 2 comes out everyone will be whipping a Tesla for their car. More points if somehow you still aren't convinced \\- Giga factories almost complete in Berlin ( one more month) and Austin (by end of year) this will result in crazy amounts of cars being made and more importantly CYBERTRUCKS \\- Gigapresses at these factories will manufacture cars faster than anything that has been done before. This translates into the CYBERTRUCK ramp being extremely fast. \\-Tesla sells every car they make and yet many terrible news sources say TSLA has demands problems. Elon himself has stated demand is the least of their worries. \\-SEMIS are being slept on, they will start coming out by the end of this year and probably take over the trucking industry the next year. Autonomous truck convoys are the future as they are so much more cost-effective. \\-Overall TSLA is trying to save the world and make it a better place by transitioning to sustainable energy and solving crazy intense real-world problems like FSD which will reduce the driving death count drastically. If you disagree with this please comment cause I would like to understand your perspective on how I am wrong. \\- WSB says they like meme stocks so much well what other CEO is constantly posting memes on Twitter? \u200b If you actually read all this and still think TSLA is overvalued please reply why after buying puts or if you really are a man sell some naked calls. POSITIONS: TSLA 1/21/2023 1500, 1600, 1700 strikes note that u gotta buy leaps, not weeklies cause ELON loves to lie about the timing of things. Although they might be late, they always come you just gotta diamond hands till then.

{"text": "Clarifications: 1. Some people are claiming that I cherry-picked data by leveraging the last 5 years of raging bull market. I am aware that this was a particularly good time period for stocks, and have explicitly acknowledged this issue in the original post itself. This strat also works over the life of data* that is available to me. This 11 year period includes the 2020 flash crash, Aug'11 bear market, 2015-16 China crash/US markets selloff, 2018 crypt0 crash, and 2020 covid crash. 2. Testing over 2007-2008 would have been great, and I concur with many of you that if markets stayed flat over 2 years, this strat loses substantial capital. This is also acknowledged in the original post. I'm not claiming this to be some strat with huuuge upside and very little downside or more correctly not volatility adjusted returns. If this doesn't describe you, this post won't be useful to you. \"Dollar cost average into index funds\" is the most non-controversial financial advice you can get. It has long been the gospel of bogleheads and other hands-off styles of investors and for a good reason: Stocks follow a Weiner process with positive drift. viz. Over the long term markets go up, and in the years when they go down they fall less than they gain in the years when they go up. Then the question must be asked - is there a way to leverage this.. loosely speaking.. \"guarantee\" of positive movement over the long term? What is the safest way to do so? I could think of 3 ways: 1. Buy index funds on margin. This is well studied and documented is IBKR and it comes at the price of not doing margin calls. They'll sell your investments at the worst possible time. 110% long is the highest I am willing to go with this method. 2. Levered ETFs - I am not knowledgeable on this subject but from what I understand they're not meant to be held long term due to contango and rebalancing. Please feel free to correct me or add color. 3. Buy calls. Control the upside on 100x shares for less that the price of 100x underlying. This is the subject of this post Research methodology: I backtested this approach with Quantconnect and found that buying 40 delta calls that expire at least 1 year out (LEAPs) every month and scaling in slowly over 2 years beats the market by 5:1. The approach is not without risks. Options are a wasting asset. The scenario in which it loses the entire capital invested is if the US stock markets behaved like Japan in the 90s. Investing in stocks lump sum is preferable to DCA but it would be too risky with options. So we scale in slowly over 24 months, buying a fixed dollar amount worth of SPY LEAPs. Leverage is set to 1. We won't be borrowing money to buy calls. Margins calls are terrifying enough with equity. Built-in leverage is sufficient. No stock picking, no market timing, no indicators, no hedging. Wake up once a month, find the expiration that's closest to 380 days from today, identify a 40 delta strike (slightly out of money) and buy a preset dollar amount worth. Do this for 2 years. Sell the call 2 weeks before expiry (avoids assignment, gamma risk, accelerated theta decay). After 2 years, stop adding more principal, just reinvest profits the same way as before. For example on June 1st 2021 we would have bought SPY220617C00445000@$194. Why 40 delta? 2 weeks? 2 years? These were just common sense starting points. I'm sure you can fine-tune them but I did not want to risk overfitting the algorithm with additional parameters. OTM calls makes sense intuitively due to volatility skew and the fact that % moves are bigger. ITM calls are more expensive and if I wanted higher delta I'd just buy shares without expiry risk. SPY was chosen because it's as liquid as it gets. The algorithm is buying at ask and selling at bid (market orders). In practice we can try bidding lower/higher with a bit of patience but that's the least of our concerns. Inb4 \"short term capital gain taxes\" - we choose expiry 380 days out + sell 2 weeks before expiry which means holding period always qualifies for LTCG treatment. This makes our approach comparable with \"buy and hold index\" or \"dollar cost average index\" on a pre as well as post tax basis. Finally because of the way the backtesting engine works, I had to seed the algorithm with $500,000 paper money and make $500,000/24 = 21k worth of a purchase each month. This means that in the first 2 years we're not fully invested. This cash drag understates the returns a bit but that's okay. If you calculate the TWR on invested capital by hand it will be even higher in practice so no harm done. Backtest was conducted over last 5 years (Jun'16 to Jun'21). Yes, this method is empirical, and the 5 years happened to be good for stockholders. But I don't have a crystal ball for the next 5 years and this is as scientific as it can get. The important question is whether this strategy has legs or are we paying too much premium to make money over a sufficiently large and flexible* time period. Results: [ [ Total return for DCA into LEAPs: 609.75% Total return for DCA into SPY shares: 154.49% (benchmark#1) Total return for lump sum SPY shares: 421/190-1 = 121.57% (benchmark#2) Worst drawdown - surprisingly low 49.2% Sharpe ratio - 1.23 PSR - 50.4% (We don't give a shit about the last 2 metrics. We knew this was going to be volatile.) My takeaway: Unless a calamity occurs and doesn't resolve itself for more than 5 years, this strategy will propel me towards an early retirement. I'm keeping all my current savings invested in an all weather portfolio, but the new money will buy LEAPs every month. If this works well, see you in walhalla. If this goes tits up, no biggie, keeping my job for 2 more years won't kill me. Biggest risk to implementing this strategy well is psychological. Human nature is to equate high win rates with better strategies rather than ones with higher, skewed expectancy. I fully expect some of these monthly purchases to go to zero, but hopefully the others will more than make up for the losses. So long as I don't shit my pants and keep buying that is..

He raised it with the assumption that HRC (hot rolled coil) benchmark futures prices will remain above $1175/t. Prices are currently above $1650/t and $1325/t into January of 2022. As Farmer Jim Liebenthal says: this thing is a printing press for cash. They\u2019re generating so much cash they don\u2019t know what to do with it. Economic commentators have blamed the brief risk-off attitude toward commodities and industrials on worries about change in fed policy vis a vis inflation. Tomorrow the Fed announces their comments on interest rates and inflation. This is expected to be a formality; the fed has telegraphed its moves for months. It realizes that any surprise change in policy or plan moving forward would rock the markets and put the recovery at risk. The fed most likely won\u2019t change interest rates and will continue down the \u2018transitory inflation\u2019 storyline.

{"text": "TL;DR - HEAVY SHORT INTEREST, MULTIPLE UPCOMING CATALYSTS, LOW FLOAT, HEALTHY COMPANY WITH NO DEBT AND EXCESS OPERATIONAL CASH, BEAT DOWN BY SHORTS AND PRIMED FOR A COME BACK, RUMORS OF HIGHLY PROFITABLE PARTNERSHIPS Hello degenerates, I like you have been watching the roller coasters and rocket ships that is this market and think I've found something very early with great upside. LET'S START WITH THE BASICS Canoo is an EV startup that will be selling commercial and passenger vehicles that are in production and are slated to be released next year. They have had a lot of unfounded trepidation surrounding their SPAC debut which has lead to shorts bombarding this stock to well below it's fair cost. As far as EVs go it is one of the healthiest EV's on the market currently with $641.9 million in cash and ONLY $6.9 million in long-term debt with a market cap of just $2.3 billion. This is huge in terms of long term potential when $GOEV can easily be a 10 bn mkt cap stock. Let's talk shorts The current float available to short is 0.15%, you apes know what this means, borrow fee is 24.5% meaning the demand is HUGE. A buy and hold can cause a monumental squeeze here and there's only 11 days to cover. I'm going to refer you guys to /u/ny92 post here because he did a great write up: Does it meet key conditions for a squeeze? High short interest: Yes, ~29.7% short interest link link: Yes, Nasdaq has the avg. daily share volume at 2.6M, ( Yahoo Finance has previous volume at 3.8M and average volume at 5.4M ( marketwatch has the average at 5.59M ( High short ratio: Yes, based on the volume numbers above \u2013 we\u2019re looking at anywhere from 5.3 to 11.3 so shorts really shouldn\u2019t be able to cover within the week, possibly even two weeks ( Nasdaq 11.3 ( Other points of interest 6/17 will be Investor Relation's day, a potential catalyst as the company is urged to share some good news because of short attacks. 6/25 GOEV/Canoo will be added to the Russell 3000 index along with our other favorite meme stocks like GME. This is a tremendous catalyst for volume. Keep in mind that half of the short interest here is ALREADY under water. They've been short since April and at $9 or under they have been paying a 25% rate. There will be MASSIVE covering. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ok so, what about the long-term? Besides their very healthy balance sheet and being vastly oversold they seem to be getting a lot institutional attention and insider ownership, in my experience this is a VERY bullish sign. The top institutional investors in Canoo are Vanguard, Invesco and Blackrock. Institutional holdings are at about 22,661,541 shares but more importantly $GOEV stock had 55 NEW institutional investments in for a total of 18,683,793 shares. This is a sign of bullish optimism in the long term. The Covid Killer Car ( their new interior enhances interior air quality, attacks odors and kills viruses instantly, including Covid-19, and will be pre-loaded in the Premium and Adventure packages of its Lifestyle Vehicle. Their vehicles will have both luxury and more affordable models along with a commercial line. Coupled with INNOVATIVE TECH the designs are so good that Apple wanted the designer which leads me to my next point.. The juicy speculative rumors - Apple Partnership - The co-founder and CEO of Canoo Ulrich Kranz has stepped down and been hired to help with the development of the Apple Car. A lot of people initially thought this was bad for Canoo but I see it as a bullish sign. He is still a major shareholder and his design's have been implemented into the vehicles that will be released next year and they were good enough that Apple hired him to design theirs. More importantly there have been rumors of Apple teaming with Canoo to use their self-driving software or parts of their already developed hardware since it's trademarked by Canoo. Limited Apple partnership could be imminent. This can be a HUGE partnership for Canoo and can easily 10x their stock. SEC investigation - I think I should cover this even though it's entirely baseless. This initially made the stock take a huge hit and has more or less been deemed to be nothing. There is so much positive news boiling up that once people reinvest and realize nothing will come of this I can see a lot of FOMO from previous sellers. The Long and short of this stock is bullish, if you were just to buy it and forget about it you would do well, if you were to play an upcoming squeeze you would do well, this is a healthy and innovative company that has been unfairly shorted way below it's fair market value.

The red candle from yesterday (June 10) closed with less volume than the uptrend candles the days prior, which is supportive of our bullish thesis. Bullish continuation usually has increasing volume on bullish price with less volume on pullbacks. Today's candle is especially bullish as price has cleared above yesterdays and the day prior's high. Again, the float of this stock is extremely low, so price can move even more volatile compared to GME. Unusual Option Activity: We are seeing more unusual options coming in, all with Sweep Orders.

Our target is based on our $80 DCF target using WACC of 8.3% and 4.0% LT growth rate and our $72 forward Price/Sales target using a 25.0x multiple (a \\~10% premium to peers).\" Morgan Stanley: \"We remain overweight DKNG as an almost pure play on the attractive, high growth US sports betting and online gaming opportunity. We expect the market to grow from $15bn in 2025, resulting in DKNG's revenue growing from $306mm to $4bn. In turn, we see DKNG's revenue significantly outperforming consensus, which will ultimately result in higher profitability. Since its IPO, DKNG has materially outperformed our revenue and spending expectations; this should drive a larger TAM, benefit DKNG's market share, and ultimately lead to greater profitability.\" (Price target of $58.00) Argus: \"We are maintaining our BUY rating on DKNG. DraftKings is the leader in daily fantasy sports, with approximately 60% of the U.S. market by revenue, according to industry sources. The online gaming industry is in the early stages of growth, with only 4% of gross gaming revenue in the U.S. generated online, compared to 45% in more mature online gaming markets such as the U.K. As more states loosen restrictions, we expect DraftKings to benefit from its market leadership. Investors have recognized the company's potential, and the shares have outperformed since the company went public in April 2020.\" (Price target of $60.00) Evercore: \"All-in, DKNG is simply executing at levels that are well ahead of what we would have anticipated: states are legalizing at a rapid pace, the ramp in the most recently legalized states is accelerating quicker, and legacy states like NJ are sustaining growth for much longer. As such, both our near and long term estimates move higher...DKNG is not resting on its laurels either, this quarter the company announced two acquisitions: VSiN aimed at supporting engagement and lowering CAC and BlueRibbon to build technical infrastructure for iGaming. In addition, the company outlined plans to launch DraftKings Social, which we believe could enhance / differentiate the user experience, increase user stickiness, and potentially give rise to powerful network effects.\" (Price target: $75.00) Jefferies: \"Focus on near-term market share is relevant but besides the main point of our thesis, which is that proliferation continues faster than originally expected and DKNG remains a top constituent. Our take from the last quarter is that DKNG remains on track to grow as a first mover from multiple perspectives: technological integration, product breadth and ultimately revenue. We expect revenue guidance and shares to continue progression higher. Reiterate Buy\" (Price target: $75.00) Cowen: \"We estimate that DKNG is able to grow net revenue at +24% CAGR from 2020 - 2030 to $5.4bn, and achieve its $1.7bn EBITDA target by 2030, in line with management targets outlined at their March 2021 Investor Day. DraftKings holds key structural advantages vs. competitors including its differentiated daily fantasy sports led customer acquisition capability and agility to market in legalized states.

Let's start with 30min / 30 day chart. 7th June and 18th June looking very similar. Also 15th June as well, but we'll come back to that later MACD \\- we are looking at crossover STOC \\- We are under the 20 line and going steeply north. Notice the similar pattern in the 3rd & 4th and the 17th & 18th RSI \\- we just went under 30 and going north Also, notice the two yellow lines. That is CLF's channel and we are residing near the bottom level. This in theory means that there is a lot of potential going up and far. We'll come back to that in the 1 day chart. ( 1 Day / \\~9 Months In here we focus on our channel, the area between the two yellow lines, and the high volume days and their follow-up. But before that let's go through the indicators. MACD \\- Crossover, but not the positive one. But notice the blue line, we are in an long upward trend that has not been broken. STOC \\- Going down, not great RSI \\- going gown, we are already under 50 so we are not over or under priced. For our bullish thesis it's great that we have room to grow. The pink, green, and yellow circles and the attached lines indicate high volume days. The dotted orange line roughly represents the low price development. Higher floors. While the 1 Day chart can indicates that there might be few downer days ahead, personally I am looking how close we hit the bottom channel on last Friday, along side the bullish indicators for the 30min and the 15min chart that we'll cover next. ( 15min / 11 Days Here we want to look at the short term trend and find similar patterns. At this point it is also good to keep the 30min and 1day information in the back of our minds. MACD \\- Crossover, the positive one. Very similar to the pink and green in the past. Indicating that an upward momentum is starting. STOC \\- Heading north. Pink and green show very similar pattern, green more than pink though RSI \\- Again, we went down under 30 for a good while, again similar to pink and green. The difference to pink and green though, is the what we saw in the 1 day chart. We are at the very bottom of the channel, which means that there is a lot of room to grow inside the channel in the coming weeks. You might have noticed that we are under our dotted orange high volume indicator. If I was an oracle, which I am not, I would expect that the price increases towards $21 - $22 in a steady manner, and then inside that range we will see a high volume day or few that will ignite the next movement towards the north star.

Now we are in a waning moon and even though we saw no pop, it's still following the moon phase pattern in my humble opinion. Also, I explained all this in my vid last week, we needed to start jumping more each day leading into the Full Moon for the Pop. We went up 2 days before the Full Moon more than the day before the Full Moon so the setup just wasn't there. You can see this setup in all the previous Full Moons, which had price action climbing more and more each day into the Full Moon. I'll see you all at the next one.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-06-26 10:30:45", "id": "o7z71d"}
{"text": "Hey fellow retards, This is my second post about $ERJ (first one here Since my previous post, the price for $ERJ has skyrocketed to $14+ but I still think there is a lot of catalysts to push the prices up. Here is a few of them: - CPI data shows increase in airfare, therefore air travel demand has increased. Not only that, a lot of the new airline startups are giving preference to smaller jets rather than $BA behemoths. - ERJ just announced merger with a SPAC ( on electric urban mobility vehicles (think flying cars). - ERJ planes haven\u2019t crashed ( I know, but worth mentioning that its a competitive advantage to $BA). - ERJ is still bellow pre pandemic levels and below valuation from 2019 when the $BA merger was announced.

{"text": "You are already aware of a promising, hyper-growth stock that goes by $SPCE \u2013 Virgin Galactic. The purpose of this analysis is to inform you about all of the ins and outs of Virgin Galactic, so that you can be confident and informed, think of it as doing your own Due Diligence. Company Overview: Here is a Statement from SPCE\u2019s 10-K filing. The market for commercial space flight is a new concept that is yet to be explored, however there are a few other companies that are trying to break into this industry as well (i.e. $LMT - Lockheed Martin so that these seemingly regular people have the chance to do something extraordinary and explore what space has to offer. Thus far, Virgin Galactic has $80M in deposits from over 600 people, who are interested in using Virgin Galactic as a vehicle to explore space. Virgin Galactic is expecting to receive their last FAA approval needed to fly their customers in their aircrafts. Investment Information: Commercial Space Flight Industry: Over the past decade, space flight has been innovated consistently, through rapidly advancing technologies, decreasing costs, and greater access to capital for private space flight companies/organizations. Many governments have taken a hands-off approach to space flight and funded private companies who compete for contracts and are forced to be constantly innovating in order to win these contracts. This competition has resulted in technologies that greatly reduce the waste, emissions, and cost of space travel. Virgin Galactic has been able to incorporate the best innovations in space flight into their aircrafts to create a reusable rocket that increases launch consistency, number of launches, and decreases the cost of space exploration. Lastly, Virgin Galactic is exploring certain strategic relationships in order to advance their technologies, identify new applications, accelerate their progress, and enhance their growth as a company. Financial Information: Financial Performance (Good): Virgin Galactic increased their R&D expenses by 19% YoY, although this is considered a cost, it is necessary for their business to spend on R&D, and I believe the improvements in technology derived from R&D spending will be considered an asset in the future. Financial Performance (Bad): In 2020, Virgin Galactic\u2019s revenues decreased by 93.7%, their gross profit decreased by 96.34%, their net loss increased by 199.79%, and their net margin decreased from 47% to 27%. This is due to the fact that the US government decreased their engineering service budget, having adverse effects on Virgin Galactic\u2019s business. Liquidity Position: Virgin Galactic currently has a cash position of $665.9M (and an additional $13M of restricted cash). Having this many cash should help Virgin Galactic to weather the storm in the meantime until the eventually are able to have a positive net income. Stock-Based Compensation: Virgin Galactic\u2019s board of directors, along with the shareholders adopted the 2019 Incentive Award Plan, which reserved 21.21M common shares to be awarded to employees, consultants, and directors. If these shares were to be distributed evenly over the next 3 years, there would be dilutionary effects of 2.85%/year. Director Compensation Table: Virgin Galactic awards members on their board with stock awards, in 2020, Virgin Galactic gave out awards of $124,994 to 4 board members, totalling $500k of stock compensation. In Virgin Galactic\u2019s 10-K report they stated that this compensation resulted in a total of 99,465 shares distributed to these members. This would cause share dilution of around 0.04% which is essentially negligible. Anniversary Awards: Virgin galactic also gave out some \u201canniversary awards\u201d to some of their highest-ranking employees, to recognize their ongoing service. In 2020, they gave out 931,93 common shares to 4 of their longest-standing, high-ranking employees, this would cause share dilution of 0.4%, although this dilution is not a large figure it still adds up over time. Colglazier Awards: In 2020, Virgin Galactic awarded their CEO \u2013 Michael Colglazier with a maximum of 1,070,000 in monthly installments over 60 months. This represents 214,000 shares being distributed to him every year, which would have a dilutionary effect of 0.09%/year. Palermo Awards: Furthermore, in 2020, Virgin Galactic also awarded their COO, Enrico Palermo with a maximum of 200,828 shares, however upon retirement he only decided to take 25% (50,207 shares), which would cause a dilution of existing shares of 0.02%. Exercisable Options: Currently, there are 717,603 underlying shares in options that are exercisable. If all of these options are exercised there will be dilutionary effects of around 0.3%, although this is not much it adds up. Virgin Galactic\u2019s Strategy: Virgin Galactic plans to use their proprietary and reusable flight system to seek to provide affordable, safe, reliable, and regular transportation to space for their customers. Virgin Galactic has highlighted a few ways in which they intend to achieve this: Commercial program for Human Spaceflight: Virgin Galactic is in their final stages of readying their commercial spaceflight program and has been vigorously testing their VSS Unity Spaceship. By looking at the management team you get an idea of their experience and expertise in the field, which helps to validate the company and decrease the chances of a scam. (A great example of a SPAC with an awful management team is $NKLA - Nikola. Virgin Galactic\u2019s CEO was formerly the Chief of Staff at NASA and was the Space Shuttle Launch Integration Manager at NASA as well. Virgin Galactic\u2019s President of Aerospace Systems has 20 years of experience in aerospace, defense, and cyber security industries. Virgin Galactic\u2019s VP of Engineering had 40 years of experience working under Lockheed Martin. Virgin Galactic\u2019s team of pilots has 269 years of combined flight experience with organizations like NASA, RCAF, RAF, US Air Force, and the US Marine Corps. Furthermore, there are many distinguished members on Virgin Galactics Space Advisory board including former NASA Chief of Staff George Whitesides, and former astronauts Sandy Magnus and Chris Hadfield. I think that this management team is well-rounded, and very experienced. This is very good to see in a business as technical as Virgin Galactic\u2019s and it shows me the legitimacy of their business and their future potential. Furthermore, there is no doubt in my mind that this is a legitimate company who is making serious efforts to change space travel for all of mankind. Competitors: Virgin Galactic has competition both in the private space, and in the public markets. Virgin Galactic\u2019s private competition provides more of a threat to their operations/business, so I decided to include them. However, Virgin Galactic\u2019s public competitors are not as big of a threat, but I have to include them in this section because of the comparable analysis that is later to come. Virgin Galactic\u2019s private competitors include Space X, and Blue Origin, both of these companies (namely Space X) have made tremendous strides in the space travel industry and have made several advancements that have made space travel easier to access. Virgin Galactic\u2019s public competitors, are companies that operate similarly to Virgin Galactic, have similar goals for their business, and are listed on the public markets. These companies include The Boeing Company ($BA),,]( Aerojet RocketDyne Holdings Inc. ($AJRD),.]( These companies will be seen again in the comparable analysis, where I will compare the financial ratios and multiples of Virgin Galactic to that of these competitors. Investment Valuation: The only way in which I could value Virgin Galactic is via comparable analyses. Furthermore, since there were only 3 multiple and/or ratios that exhibited a positive number, I had to choose to compare those ratios/multiples. The ratios/multiples that I chose were P/B I arrived at a fair value per share of $SPCE of $25.73, which implies a downside risk of 29.24%. EV/Assets: By comparing Virgin Galactic\u2019s EV/Assets multiple to that of their public competitors, I arrived at an implied downside of 69.17%, or a share price of $11.21. PEG: The last ratio that I examined was the PEG, which implied an upside of 14.99% to a share price of $41.81. Average Comparable: In order to arrive at an unbiased valuation, I decided to take the average of the 3 results that I arrived at through my comparable analyses. By doing this, I got an all-encompassing fair value of $26.25/share, which would imply a downside risk of 27.80%. I do not think that this is the be all and end all for valuing $SPCE, because in this analysis I compared their ratios/multiples to other companies that were already more mature and were not solely focused on commercial space flight. An example of this is Boeing. Boeing has plans for space travel, however their business is generated through the sale of airplanes, this is vastly different from Virgin Galactic so the comparable does not make the most sense. So, although Virgin Galactic is not an undervalued stock today, they may be in the future when they make their own revenues. However, I do think that this valuation implies that current and potential investors should be aware of the risk and potential downside of this investment, however wherever there is risk, there is reward, and the reward for this investment could be astronomical (once again pun intended). Risks: Share Dilution: Virgin Galactic has a lot of programs, and awards that incentivize their employees, and directors through stock compensation. These programs/awards include stock-based compensation, director compensation table, anniversary awards, Colglazier awards, Palermo awards, and exercisable option awards. By grouping all of this dilution into one figure, we arrive at a maximum dilution for the year 2020 to be 3.68%. This is a large number and should be considered by new and existing shareholders alike. However, this is a high growth potential investment, so it is not uncommon to have higher figures of dilution. Financial Performance: Virgin Galactic\u2019s financial performance in 2020 was very poor, however it was due to the loss of contractual revenue from the US government. In the grand scheme of things, Virgin Galactic will not be relying on the US Government for the majority of their revenues, so it should not scare away investors from the bigger picture revenues for Virgin Galactic. Catalysts: FAA Approval: If Virgin Galactic can get their last 2 approvals from the FAA, they can start to take their commercial space flight business seriously and start to generate their own revenues. Once they start generating their own revenues, they should be able to turn a profit and work towards overall profitability of the business. Successful Flights: If Virgin Galactic can continue to have successful trials and flights, their reputation as a commercial space travel business will be solidified. This is especially important during the early stages of their business because trust is everything. TLDR Great financials, strong leadership, and milestone accomplishments. SPCE is poised for continued growth if they can continued down this path.

{"text": "What is Corsair? Corsair is a gaming company which has recently gained a lot of popularity because of Wallstreetbets and rightfully so, in my opinion. They sell computer peripherals, gaming and studio accessories, custom-made PCs, components, services and so on, effectively offering customers a one-stop shop for anything related to computer hardware, gaming software and other computer services. The company believes that they can address a market size of up to $46B or about 24 times larger than their current market share of $1.9B and they are expanding rapidly to make this happen. Over the last 12 months, Corsair acquired 3 new companies and launched 84 new products while showing a 47% growth in revenue in the latest quarter as compared to last year, 104% growth in gross profit and a staggering 197% growth in adjusted EBITDA! So, how are they achieving this massive growth? Essentially, Corsair is trying to tap two of the fastest growing markets right now, gaming and eSports, plus digital content creation which can be seen in their two main revenue streams: Gaming Component and Systems, and Gamer and Creator Peripherals which were split relatively evenly last quarter in terms of sales. Corsair is using the growth in the eSports market which is estimated to grow 11% annually over the next 5 years to kickstart their own growth. If you think about it, all of those millennials that grew up playing games are now able to afford specialised gaming gear which is what Corsair is offering. We're also seeing a big number of Generation Z entering the labour market and being able to afford more expensive gaming gear. Gaming and esports have already become mainstream with professional gamers earning serious cash and rivalling mainstream sport athletes in earnings so we can tell that this is just the beginning of it. The digital content creation market is also growing at an annual rate of 13% across the board. YouTube, Twitch and other video, streaming and podcasting platforms are experiencing a massive surge in both creators and users. Corsair wants to use to this to drive their sales using their Creator Peripherals products. Working from home has also led a lot of people to improve their home offices and that trend is here to stay, which provides even more opportunities for Corsair to tap into yet another growing market. Finally, the company wants to convert existing customers into loyal customers that come back to buy again and again and again. To do that, they are driving engagement through social media and they currently have a combined following of over 20mln across 4 different social media websites, plus they are represented by over 800 different influencers with a reach of over 1.3B people! They also offer customisation and personalisation in their products, they are focusing to be the best-in-class hardware and on selling solutions, services and software that will cater to the needs of gamers and creators. Customer retention is always a winning strategy for companies when it comes down to optimising earnings and it is good to see that Corsair is focusing on it although I would also like them to start sharing some KPIs that track this. # Bullish Thesis Before I go into my bullish thesis, I want to point out that the current stock price that I am looking at is $36. Alright, so, the company doesn't really have any strong rivals in my opinion which is a strong bullish argument. There is Pegatron, but the company has suffered a lot over the last year due to labor violations. Another is Razer, but they haven't shown a lot of promise over the last year either. The closest rival is probably Logitech, but their business model and strategy are much different than Corsair's and I think that Corsair has a much better positioning to tap into the growing markets. Still, both Logitech and Corsair have performed amazingly over the last 12 months although I see Corsair as having a much better potential for growth. Right now, it is only a seventh of the size of Logitech with a $3.3B market cap versus Logitech's $21.7B although Corsair's revenue is less than 3 times smaller than Logitech's with a $1.9B vs $5.2B in revenue. Their Price-to-Sales ratio is 1.74 for Corsair and 4.14 for Logitech so we can see that Corsair is actually undervalued in terms of sales. The main reason why Corsair is lagging behind is their net income which is still relatively low, but as I mentioned earlier in this video, their growth is supercharged and off the charts. Plus, this is completely understandable for a company that is in its early growth phase. Another bullish argument is the fact that a lot of hedge funds and institutions are betting AGAINST Corsair which gives us the opportunity for a short squeeze! About 18% of Corsair's share float is shorted, which is extremely high and completely unjustified in my opinion! The company is performing extremely well and they are trading at a low price. Their forward PE is only 17.9 which is tiny for a growth company as opposed to Logitech's forward PE of 27! Plus, Corsair absolutely CRUSHED their latest earnings, beating earnings per share by $0.25 or about 75%. They also beat their revenue estimate by $76M or almost 17% AND, to top it all of, they raised their guidance, but the price still dropped! Analysts keep revising their earnings estimates up, which is yet another bullish signal. Plus, Corsair has enough current assets to cover their current liabilities and has a low debt so financial health is not really a problem. They have one Venture Capital fund, EagleTree Capital, hold 62% of the company and insiders hold another 4% which gives us a massive, absolutely massive opportunity for price growth especially when we look at their tiny market cap! I honestly think that Corsair can easily double in price and still be a relatively good purchase. The company is that good. Finbox's DCF model currently gives us a 43% upside with a target price of $51.5 and SimplyWallstreet's DCF model gives us a fair value of $80.3, a 123% upside so we can see that there are some decent bullish arguments behind Corsair. However you look at it, Corsair is a beast of a company and an absolute bargain. There is no point in technical analysis right now. WSB boosted the stock and distorted all the signals. The only thing that's worth looking at is the 50D MA which is currently around $32-$33 and whether it will act as support for the current price. We can reasonably expect $40-$42 to serve as a resistance at this point. # Final thoughts Honestly, out of all the companies that I've been researching recently, this one looks the most promising. Corsair is one of my biggest holdings right now and I will just keep adding to it.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-06-16 21:13:31", "id": "o11i2j"}
{"text": "Hi all, I\u2019ve spent the past month learning everything I can about the space industry and the companies involved. Long story short \u2013 Maxar Technologies (MAXR) is the best buy in aerospace right now. Maxar is the market leader in both satellite imagery and satellite development for space exploration. Here is an overview: Maxar has built over 285 different satellites over the years, for various commercial and government customers or for their own constellations. Maxar is a frequent contractor for NASA and is the industry leader in robotic arms and electric propulsion technology. For the upcoming Moon mission, Maxar is contracted to build the propulsion and communication module \u2013 a large and critical part of the spacecraft. Maxar provides 90% of the geospatial intelligence used by the U.S. military 3.8 billion people use Maxar imagery every day \u2013 through online maps like Google Maps and through telecommunications companies Maxar will be critical to innovation globally going forward \u2013 every industry and government will increase their use of geospatial technology and Maxar will be the principal company they rely on. With a market cap of only $2.8 billion (plus 1.5% insider ownership), Maxar is highly undervalued. Wall Street analysts give the stock a price target of $52-$60 which would be a 37% gain from where it is now. What do I think this company is worth? Way more. I\u2019d say it should have a $10 billion market cap currently, or growth of over 700%. There is a $25 billion pipeline of aerospace contracts over the next five years (a figure being cited by multiple aerospace companies) and Maxar will be in a great position to capitalize on the growing opportunities. As the market continues to grow, Maxar will become an increasingly bigger player going forward. Stock history: The stock started trading in 2004 at around $20/share. It peaked from 2014-2015 at $80/share. Then it crashed from 2016-2018 - hitting a low of $5/share - because of concerns over the amount of debt the company was holding. Since then, Maxar sold off a portion of the company to a Canadian subsidiary and balanced their budget. Since 2019 the stock has shown solid growth, now sitting at around $40. FYI: For some reason the Fidelity and Robinhood charts only show the stock history since 2017. Look on Google for the full chart since 2004. My position: $40 MAXR calls expiring July 16. I think it it should peak at around $50 sometime this next month. And it will continue to grow going forward.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-06-24 04:20:21", "id": "o6hhvy"}

This new share buyback program will commence immediately and follows the previous buyback program which is now complete.

{"text": "Our Apes, who art in rocket ships, hallowed by thy Workhorse tendies, thy moon will come; thy will be done on WKHS as it is in GME. Give us this day our daily mooning; and forgive us our short selling as we forgive those who short sell against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the hedgies. Amen. My dearest Apes, I speak to you again: As you've seen from my previous posts, WKHS is legally battling with Oskosh (OSK) and the USPS over the unlawful recipient of the contract award. Well, here are some more important updates: I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU THOUROUGHLY READ THE ENTIRETY OF THIS FILING\\^ (IT IS LOADED WITH INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE UNLAWFUL USPS AWARDING) The document has been redacted (presumably due to NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) between the parties. \"The USPS\u2019s unreasonable actions directly harm Plaintiff... Had the USPS conducted the procurement in accordance with applicable law, the Solicitation requirements, and fundamental fairness, Workhorse would have been awarded the contract\" The USPS evidently decided early in the NGDV Program that Workhorse would not be the awardee, but it chose not to inform Workhorse of this fact, instead allowing and even encouraging Workhorse to continue to pursue the contract. In the meantime, the USPS put its thumb on the scale against Workhorse. It falsely blamed Workhorse\u2019s prototype vehicle for a \u201csafety incident\u201d that was clearly the result of the USPS driver\u2019s error. It engaged in discussions with Workhorse that improperly failed to meaningfully notify Workhorse of perceived deficiencies in its proposal and that misled Workhorse as to the areas Workhorse needed to address in its updated proposal. And it unfairly evaluated the merits of Workhorse\u2019s proposal, treating Workhorse far more harshly and holding it to far stricter standards, than it did the other offerors. As was the USPS\u2019s design all along, these improper actions left Workhorse with a technical score that ensured it had no fair chance of a contract award. None of this was known to Workhorse. \" And the coup de gras: \"Workhorse respectfully requests this Court to enter judgment in Plaintiff\u2019s favor and to provide the following relief: 1. Entry of judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against the United States; 2. Entry of a declaratory judgment that the award to Oshkosh was unlawful and improper and an injunction directing that the award be terminated; 3. Entry of an injunction directing the USPS to reevaluate the offerors\u2019 proposals in accordance with the terms of the Solicitation, applicable laws, and regulations; 4. Entry of an injunction directing the USPS to conduct a new best value determination; and 5. Such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper\" \u200b WKHS YOLO: \u200b Now once again, I will reiterate briefly: The contract was awarded to Oshkosh, who cannot confirm neither deny that the company submitted an EV model for durability testing. Nor did they say whether they have performed a powertrain transition swap, swapping out an internal combustion engine transmission for electric counterparts, as the contract stated. (See below) The fact that our favorite hedgies are back at it again, (See their WKHS short position below) is once again short against a company that is purposely being driven down with the help of our Post Master General for his own personal gain. As you can tell, the horse community is growing, media mentions are brewing, the short interest is steady, oscillating between 40-60+% depending on who your source are. Currently, we will use ORTEX, although not always 100% accurate: \u200b OPTION ANAYLSIS: [7\\/2 Expiry Option Chain. From the image above, you can see that more than 1.65% of shares outstanding sit at the 18 strike. Also, 1.47% shares outstanding are short at the 30 strike. Not to mention, Open Interest Updates the following trading day, so this means that WKHS was short to these percentages as of Friday's trading day close. So, let us take a closer look at the volume. * At the 18 Strike there is currently over 37k volume and 20k volume at the 20 strike. This is massive, considering the open interest at the 18 strike currently resides at 22,065. And the 20 OI being 2,863. However, we need to be smart apes. We are competing against the hedgies, let us remember that. So, let us look at the put side. Where is Citadel trying to press us down to? From the looks of it, 15. Which Today, there was 13k volume in the 15 strike with only 4k OI. Presumably, a lot more puts were written today implying downward pressure. HERE'S THE KICKER: The float is roughly 135,000,000. Half is short sold (\\~67 Million shares) Todays volume is 44 million+ and climbing while I write this. LOL!!!!! Do the math people. (44/67, that is nearly 2/3's.)

{"text": "I understand why people want to buy FDs for the huge gains if a meme stock moons, but I don't understand why people would choose stocks over ITM LEAPs. LEAPS that are ITM around 0.7-0.8 delta usually cost around 30-50% of the actual stock price with very little extrinsic value, so there's minimum impact from volatility. The break even price is usually very close to the current share price. You would gain much more with the same investment if you spent the money on LEAPS instead, and you can still diamond or paper hands just the same. As an example, $WISH (currently at $11.07/share) LEAP for 1/22 7.5c is currently $5.45. This gives a strike even price at $12.95. If you spend $1000 on $WISH and it doubles next week, you would net $1000 if you bought stocks with it, but if you bought the LEAP option you would net $2000 instead. Also, while the break even is $12.95, this is only at expiration. If you sell earlier you recoup a lot of your extrinsic costs since theta decay is so slow. For example, if $WISH goes from $11.07/share to $13 next week and you closed the LEAP, you would make \\~$300 even though it's right at your \"break even\" point.

{"text": "This my quick and top of the head version of DCF model for BNGO. Please note that I haven't made any pin-point assumptions. All assumptions are ballmark to just get an high level price estimate. I'm not a financial advisor nor a financial analyst. I'm just a random guy applying his financial education in real life. I'm more than happy to hear your feedback and update my analysis with more accurate numbers or correct any wrong assumptions. Please let me know if I'm missing any other types of revenues/expenses. If you feel its justified, feel free to share it on other social media platforms! :) Recently on SeekingAlpha, an analyst did his DCF model and his price came out to be $7.3 which I feel wasn't justified enough. I believe it was because he didn't factor in Saphyr 2.0 potential and didn't project his sales for longer years. Well, so I took it upon myself as a small little challenge to do a DCF myself. NOTE: This does not include the Nanonozzle revenue projection because at this point in time, its really hard to estimate those numbers. Also just wanted to note that the top analysts on Tip Rank gave BNGO an average price target of $12. I think this sort of proves my analysis that BNGO is at least worth $12. EDIT: I have received some critical feedback on my analysis from my post on BNGO subreddit. I will be incorporating those changes, but it will only affect my analysis positively. \u200b \\\\\\\\\\\\TLDR; #BNGO2THEMOON\\\\\\\\\\\\ \u200b Units Installed: Expected sales of Saphyr to increase about 80% every year as more and more labs/clinics/hospitals/etc start to adopt it. Though from year 2028+ I have reduced the adoption to 50% every year, giving me an almost 70% CAGR. \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Rent/Sold: I have broken the sales of Saphyr into \u201crent\u201d and \u201csold\u201d. This is because there are different consumables agreement with each type of \u201csale\u201d. As per CFO in Q1 earnings transcript, he said rentals are more sales; however, this might change as Saphyr is still finding its level. My assumption is 60% rent and slowly reducing down to 35% by 2030+. \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Revenue per Consumable: We currently know it costs $550/consumable. As BNGO\u2019s goal is to reduce it to $100, I have done about $50 decrement each year starting 2024 (when Saphyr 2.0 will launch) and achieving $100 from 2028+. \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Saphyr 1.0/2.0: Saphyr 1.0 is just 5000/14 rounding it down to 350 genomes per year. Why divide by 14? Because that\u2019s what Saphyr 2.0 will be able to do. \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Min 120 Genome per 6 month (Rent Agreement): If someone rents from Saphyr, that\u2019s what the agreement states currently. This means minimum 240genome runs at per Saphyr (rented ones) per consumable price every year. I\u2019m assuming they are running the minimum and not the maximum capacity i.e, about 350/year. \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sold Saphyr 240 Genome Bundle: Currently BNGO has a bundle going out for clients who buy Saphyr. For them, the genome run would cost $450 instead of $550. However, for ease of calculation, I have not included the $100 discount in my calculation. Everything is being multiplied by consumable price for the year. I\u2019m assuming they are running the minimum and not the maximum capacity i.e, about 350/year. \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Saphyr 2.0 Consumables: This was the trickiest part in my calculations and involves a lot of \u201cassuming stuff.\u201d We all know they are aiming to launch 2.0 by 2024. Therefore, adoption of 2.0 will take time and as a result it will take some time for revenue to start increasing from 2.0. We also know it will be able to do 5000 genomes a year, but not every lab/clinic/hospital/etc will be running that much. So for my calculation I have assumed only 5% of 5000 genomes runs will be done on the Saphyrs installed everywhere. This will increase by 2.5% over the years up to 20% by 2030+. In terms of CAGR, it will be increasing by almost 180% every year. Given the power of Saphyr 2.0, I think its reasonable enough estimate. I also think this is somewhat conservative and the number will be even higher. My calculations are based on that only 25% of the full power of Saphyr 2.0 will be used. This section is debatable and I\u2019m happy to talk more about it and update it with useful feedback. \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Revenue: Revenue growing at 79% CAGR. Again, this is a very conservative number from my perspective. Also, as per Eric (CEO), he expects the revenue to be somewhere between 2.6B \u2013 3.8B with 10,000 Saphyrs sold. In my calculation, we hit 10k mark in year 2029. We can see total revenue is around 2.3B, lower than Eric\u2019s estimation. Though my consumables estimate is between his expectation. Its just the sale of Saphyr that seems to be off. I\u2019m assuming 65% will be sales and 35% will be rent by 2029. Maybe more of sales and less of rent might be a better estimate?? \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gross Margin: Currently BNGO\u2019s margin is around 33%. To be very conservative, I haven\u2019t increased margin by a lot. I\u2019m estimating margin to steadily grow throughout the years. \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Additional Costs: This is any other costs over operating expenses, just being more conservative. I\u2019m increasing it at a rate of 20-30% over the years at a 25% CAGR. \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net Profit/(Loss): You can see BNGO will start to be profitable by year 2024. It will really start to pick up in net profits in year 2026+. \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): Formula: Cost of Equity + Cost of Debt Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + Beta\\*(Market Rate \u2013 Risk Free Rate) Risk Free Rate = 10Yr Treasury Bond = 1.75% Market Rate = 8% Beta = 2 Cost of Debt = 0 (As BNGO rarely have any debt) WACC = 14% \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Free Cash Flow: Assumed Net Profits as a source of free cash flow available to the company. \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Terminal Value: Assumed a 3% industry average for BNGO. Although this is very unlikely because BNGO is far away from its maturity stage. But for ease of calculation purpose, BNGO will grow at 3% for the rest of its life. \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Firm Value: After discounting all the CFs for 10 years at 14%, it gives me the company value to be around 5.5B. This is about 3x the current market cap. \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Outstanding Shares: The current outstanding shares are 279M. For the sake of dilution articles out there, lets say BNGO raises extra $350M and lets say at $7 price, this would mean extra 50M shares. So, out outstanding would now be 329M. \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Price per Share: With the 5.5B MV and 279M O/S share, this gives me a share price of $20. This is about 3x the current share price. Giving a potential upside of about 200%. Even with the extra $350M offering, the price would fall to $16.7 per share. Well, in any case, as per my assumptions in the discounted cashflow method, BNGO seems to be heavily discounted.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-06-01 04:48:39", "id": "np937m"}

Inflation \u2013 Inflation will have a positive impact on Macy\u2019s debt and real estate values. Real Estate goes up over time and while their Real Estate Values will go up significantly, their debt will remain the same (or valued at less if you measure it against the CPI). 3.

{"text": "First off, do your own DD. This retard has almost zero experience in finance. My only successful play was on Apple calls like 3 years ago. That being said, let\u2019s get into the fucking action. Start downing your redbulls now, and be prepared to go on a 10 hour bender of harassing users on r/conspiracy, because this shit is about to get pretty far-fetched. The man of the hour is Mr. Lloyd Austin. This 6 foot 1, 210 pound gigachad of a man is a decorated former US 4-star general. In other words, buddy gets more pussy during his morning breakfast than you\u2019ll get in your entire life. When he\u2019s not blowing up freedomless boneheads at the push of a button, he\u2019s dipping his massive cock into the finance game. After retiring in 2016, he found himself on the boards of Raytheon, Nucor, and Tenet Healthcare. However, this absolute machine of a man is never satisfied. Lloyd Austin eats, sleeps, breathes, and shits freedom. His brief retirement ended when he was appointed as Secretary of Defense under Joe Biden. That\u2019s really my whole argument to convince you to waste your money on these 3 stocks. Maybe show this shit to your alt-right and/or schizophrenic friends, they\u2019ll understand where I\u2019m going with this. There is no doubt in my mind that Lloyd is gonna look out for his guys. General motherfucking Austin didn\u2019t make it all the way to the White House for nothing. If he doesn\u2019t pull some corrupt shit to benefit the boys, I\u2019ll be thoroughly disappointed. As the first African-American to serve as Secretary of Defense, it\u2019s about fucking time that a black man gets to dish out some political favoritism. Let\u2019s break it down: You\u2019ve already seen the shitstorm surrounding RTX on this sub, so if you want some actual analysis, go find somebody on this who knows what they\u2019re talking about, because that somebody is not me. I\u2019m a simple man, and what I do know is we have a good old fashioned warmongering Dem back in the Oval Office, and he\u2019s ready to tear some shit up overseas, plus Raytheon is already leading the pack in the business of killing people. Obvious buy and hold. Now Nucor. No doubt, total boomer stock. Your grandpa probably still owns shares of steel companies. But fuck it, the DOW has been on a tear lately, and NUE is projecting record earnings for this upcoming quarter. That\u2019s all I need to hear, my underdeveloped brain says BUY BUY BUY. Tenet Healthcare. Honestly I have no clue about this one. All I know is that healthcare is generally a bit undervalued right now, but more importantly, the ticker symbol is THC. What more do you need?? Buy it. That\u2019s all I got for you boys. Hopefully somebody who passed microeconomics 101 can analyze this in expert-level detail.

{"text": "Ok, you retarded apes. Let's face the facts. DD is dogshit around here. It does not accurately represent what it should be and does not present the proper legal disclaimers. As a semi-professional DD-Writer, myself, I believe that it is my duty to try and at least somewhat help you dumbass apes. Over the course of this post, I hope to create a picture of what DD is supposed to look like, as well as how to avoid responsibility when your shitty stock tanks 90% after you wrote 30 dogshit \"DDs\" per day on why it would \"go up 400% tomorrow\". --- Title --- When writing titles for Due Diligence posts, it is important to note that you must accurately encompass your entire work in a single phrase. This might sound hard - considering you're all illiterate - but it's easy. Let's start with the basics. Titles can vary based on the type of due diligence you are writing, but generally if you're writing analysis - fundamental or technical - you will be using the same type of title. The first word must indicate whether your analysis is 100% thorough and complete (1), or rather, if there are kinks that need to be worked out within it (2) (upcoming data, etc.). You all will most certainly be using (2). In the case of (2), you must start the title of your DD with the phrase \"Preliminary analysis\". \"Preliminary\" describes whether it is in progress or not (in this case it is) and \"analysis\" is analysis. After you have written this, you must then follow it up by saying \"...on , (: ). We write it like this to specify the company whose business we will be analyzing, as well as their home index and stock ticker. After this, we write who the DD is for. In the case of company analysis for that specific company, an investment bank will put the company they are analyzing in that region. Here's an example: \"Preliminary Analysis on ContextLogin, Inc. (NASDAQ: WISH) for The Special Committee of the Constituents at WallStreetBets\" --- Legal disclaimers --- When writing papers on stocks, it is important to note that any and all assumptions you make can be seen as a form of guaranteeing movement of a stock. For example, if I were to say, \"BlackBerry is looking like it's gonna jump 30%!!! All in!!!\", the law would consider me to be giving financial advice. It is always important to preface a piece of \"DD\" with the proper legal disclaimers, so as to prevent you from being prosecuted by illiterate apes when they lose money. Before you begin the body of your \"DD\", you must give two important disclaimers: 1.) I am not a financial, accounting, tax, or legal advisor (we'll elaborate on that one in a moment) 2.) This Due Diligence is made solely for fun/private usage, and should be considered as such. This \"DD\" is not meant to be considered as anything more than an opinion and should not be treated as definitive proof of any future events (past results are no guarantee of future performance). (we'll elaborate on this one after the first mention) I have been seeing people use the term \"I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.\" The worst part about this is the fact that it is usually added at the end of their DD. Here are a few guidelines: 1.) Add your disclaimers at the beginning of your DD. 2.) The first mentioned disclaimer should include information as to what qualifications you do NOT have. Most individuals just say either \"I am not a financial advisor\" and leave it at that, while others go a step further with \"I am not a financial or tax advisor.\" The truth is that you need more than that. You must include a statement that says that you will not interfere with government authority and tax law, as well as disclosing what qualifications you do not have. And example of a proper (1) disclaimer would be: \"u/Some-other-guy-1 does not provide accounting, tax, or legal advice. Notwithstanding anything in this document to the contrary, and except as required to enable compliance with applicable securities law, you (and each of your fellow WallStreetBetters, apes, moderators, and other users) may disclose to any and all persons in the US federal income and state tax treatment and tax structure of the transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) that are provided to you relating to such tax treatment and tax structure, without u/Some-other-guy-1 imposing any limitation of any kind.\" 3.) The second mentioned disclaimer should include information that states that the DD you have written is preliminary and the stock you are doing DD on is subject to change. For example: \"The information in this presentation is based upon any information supplied to me and reflects prevailing conditions and my views as of this date, of which are suspect to Change. My estimates should be regarded as indicative, preliminary and for illustrative purposes only.\" --- Body --- Writing proper DD comes with a set of requirements on coverage of certain topics. Topics you cover in your DD should include: 1.) Market perception 2.) How does X stock compare to other members of its sector? 3.) What are some of the potential market alternatives to X stock and how might they affect the value of X stock? 4.) What alternatives may be able to overtake X stock and how might we evaluate them? After you initiate these topics, you proceed to covering them in as much depth as possible, finding as many possible answers to them as possible. Add a bull AND bear case. If you can't find any negatives for your penny stock, you're delusional. --- Conclusion --- In conclusion, I hope that this bit of guidance helps increase the quality of DD on this subreddit. Thanks for sticking around - if you did - and have a nice day!", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-06-20 07:10:08", "id": "o3oqlf"}
{"text": "TLDR: Short interest over 50 percent, reason for shorting is flawed and may even be reversed. Company has 8k vehicle production back order. If you ask anyone about WKHS, the number one thing you will hear is, \"Isn't that that company that put it all in a USPS bid and lost? Of course they are massively shorted.\" The person who made the decision, Head of the USPS Louis DeJoy, is famous for dismantling mail sorting machines just before the 2020 election. DeJoy is a Trump supporter, and it was believed that mail-in voting heavily favored Biden. He is also a climate change denier, and instead of following Biden's electric vehicle mandate, he instead awarded the contract to a gas powered vehicle company. The night before he did this, he purchased 50k worth of stock in that company. All of this is under investigation. In reality they have an 8k vehicle backlog, without the USPS deal. They have a patent on launching drones for package delivery into the 2030's. They are working closely with UPS to develop and refine this drone known as \"horsefly.\" But if all you knew was that they lost the bid, you would rightly assume it was a failing company, and that is why it is so heavily shorted. The common wisdom is wrong on this one. And that makes it a very good play. Current estimated short interest according to ortex is over 50 percent, and the borrow rate for shares has gone from 4 to 13 percent in a week.

{"text": "After the recent inflation FUD, many retail stocks got hit hard and blue chip has been slow to recover. Enter LEVI the most recognizable and best sold denim brand in the world who got extremely oversold after reaching new highs and posting earnings that beat expectations. Who is LEVI and why are they relevant now? I should slap you with my brand new pair of 541 jeans I just ordered if you really have to ask. They are the leading fashion company for everything denim. LEVI has been around for over 168 years as a profitable business, but only recently IPO\u2019d in 2019. Since then LEVI shares up 53%. Throughout the pandemic they have kicked ass in building up their e-commerce platform and have worked on making their business more sustainable with their line of water-less jeans. CEO Chip Bergh is a smart cookie \ud83c\udf6a (see what I did there), he managed to help LEVI\u2019s grow 436% last year by diversifying beyond denim and selling more directly to consumer. Projected growth is 23% for next year as a conservative value, but Chip believes they are strongly positioned to come out even higher this year as the pandemic comes to an end with more people going back out to shop and spend their money on new wardrobes. After being oversold last week, LEVI has been on a slow and steady recovery. OTM options took a big hit and are currently on freaking sale. Most price targets for end of year are around $30-32 with a high of $36 and even the most bearish analyst has $25 as their projection. That leads to me the most important section. Positions: Currently, holding 86 x $30c 10/15 which at time of posting is almost worth $1.00. Super fucking cheap and easy to ride for either a quick pop or all the way to expiration.

{"text": "Disclaimer: I am extremely biased, but I tell no lies. I just want you to make money If my goal was to make money, I would not yolo into WISH. It has a cool ticker name, I'll give it that, but after I've watched WSB pour more money into this stock than I've ever seen in such a short timespan, it still has barely moved, and the facts say UWMC will make you more money. Why? 1) Float size: WISH share float is around 338 million shares. Comparatively, UWMC is around 80m. WISH is 4x harder to move. 2) Dilution: IF WISH does rise again, they will keep dropping offerings on our heads. The UWMC CEO has already stated that he believes the company is undervalued and they have a share buyback program, there will be no dilution to stop the party. 3) Option chain: Most of UWMC's options are ITM or ATM, whereas most of WISH's call options are OTM. This means that the closer we get to friday at the current price, the more buying pressure UWMC will have and the less WISH will have due to the difference in options that need to be hedged for. This is extremely important and combined with float size is a large reason why UWMC is such a good play for this week. Every day at open the stock is assaulted by shorts because they don't want the $10 calls to stay ITM, but with more volume this stock would explode. 4) IV: Not only is the UWMC float smaller making it easier to move, but it has more ITM options at play magnifying that effect. IV is also lower on UWMC (100% vs 250%) making options cheaper by a VERY significant amount, increasing the probability of a very popular well known technical event. TLDR; Smooth brain apes keep yoloing into WISH despite the facts working against them, when there is a much more lucrative play at hand.

{"text": "If you agree with any one of the points below this is an excellent entry point. 1. Worldwide demographic change to value conscience shopping via widening of wealth gap. (Sad but true) 2. Wish local provides access to areas that have never before been able to online shop. Its also given a large competitive advantage to other areas in terms of shipping rates and product availability. 3. Wish de-emphasizing cheap products and adding new lines including furniture to bring revenue per consumer up. 4. Bringing in J.Reses as executive who\u2019s experience in this industry is invaluable. 5. Anniversary out all the lost customers who had a bad experience in Q1-2 of last year due to bad shipping times and limited product availability. This was mainly due to the early lockdown in China and banned Chinese commercial flights internationally. 6. Wish logistics revenue rising steady. This might actually be the largest revenue stream in the future as other companies hire wish for 3rd party logistics and take advantage of wish local centers. 7. The world is shifting to online shopping. Online stores will always win in regards to price and convenience as they have such a low CAPEX costs. The overhead on running a brick and mortar store is reflected in their prices. Everything is changing to online, from groceries to furniture. 8. Quality and delivery times are improving. Last quarter WISH had an all time low refund rate. They\u2019re actively delisting low quality items and misleading products. They\u2019re also on a hiring spree to further improve this segment. 9. Partnership announced yesterday with PrestaShop will get wish products listed on 300,000 new internet stores. This should add billions in revenue to $Wish\u2019s bottom line. 10. If the stock market has a correction and/or potential inflation hikes eroded consumer purchasing power we\u2019ll see a large swing into budget buying. Many people will adjust spending habits from higher priced platforms like Amazon and focus solely on price point. This will make $WISH a great company to hold during recessive times. 11.

{"text": "\u200b I want to introduce you smooth brains to a company called Vuzix. Vuzix is a crazy fucking eyewear company that are essentially the future of manufacturing and surgical tools. Now, why is this important? Google tried to do this shit like 8 years ago and nobody cared, right? Yes, that's correct. There\u2019s one other thing that's correct too. Google's attempt absolutely sucked and they did not pursue improving their product. Vuzix remains on the leading edge of smart eyeglass technology with over 146 patents. So, it\u2019s too late google, you already lost this one. \u200b Anyway since I took one semester of an entry level laser course in college, I\u2019m going to explain this technology to you. The waveguide technology employed by vuzix deliver high quality, full color images directly to your fucking eyeball. Now, these images are completely transparent so it allows the user to still interact with natural reality. This differs from other products, which deliver a useless opaque image. Now how can this help with surgery? Do you remember when Tony Stark goes into repair mode while in the iron man suit? \u200b Yeah, that\u2019s what these glasses do. They can provide a whole digital map of whichever part of the body they are working on. That\u2019s not all. They can also provide a live video stream with an augmented reality presence in order to assist surgical techs in helping their surgeon. \u200b Now that I've showed you some of Vuzix's tech lets take a look at the third graders their up against: Thirdeye Gen \\- really cool name, where\u2019d they get that at? Hot Topic?? Anyway, this company doesn\u2019t hold a candle to Vuzix. They aren\u2019t even attempting to use this crap in surgical applications yet, but they do have some implementations in healthcare by basically doing the same thing a tablet can do. This can also be said for their manufacturing applications as well. Plus, just look at these things: \u200b Microvision \\- Need I say more Vrteek \\- Mainly just focused on virtual tours and videos. That\u2019s cool, stay in your fucking lane. Manus VR - this is actually a really cool company, but their applications are more focused on digital production applications. This wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a competitor at this time but since its along the same lines it should be mentioned \u200b Time to look at some numbers for you viewers with more then 10 brain cells: In 2020 Vuzix experienced very rapid growth. This can be attributed to technology finally catching up to the product as well as a lot of new big orders from reputable companies. In 2021 Vuzix saw sales increase 2.4 million dollars, or 177% year over year!! Data interpreted from Vuzix website show Quarter 1 2021 results at a 49% improvement year over year. Sales of their products show an improvement of 2,383,000 year over year as well.. So , expenses. Vuzix operating expenses reported in Q1 of 2021 were reported to be $7,654,000. Yes, these rose compared to the same quarter last year where operating expenses were $5,339,000. Obviously this is related to increased production. What does this look like per share? Vuzix reported net loss per share of -$.12. Year over year, this is a -$.06 improvement. * Vuzix is becoming more efficient. With increased sales and lower operating costs this company is pushing towards positive cash flow in the coming quarters. See below from vuzix website: \u200b \u200b I want to talk about this stock over the past few months. Vuzix saw an amazing run up in their stock price following both their quarter 4 2020 results as well as the q1 2021 results. Following q1 2020 the stock price rose an incredible 443% to an at the time high of $23.59. Q1 2021 results brought a slight dip in the stock price followed by another run-up of 30% to an all time high of $30.57. Sounds like some real fomo territory right? Following this impressive all time high this stock has seen a decrease of 43%. It now sits at $17.48 per share. A bit of a drop from its ATH (aqua teen hunger...force). A drop in this territory is completely natural for a growing company. During a press release on March 26 Vuzix announced that they were offering 4.1 million shares of its common stock at $20.50 a share (compared to the stock price of $26.32 at this time). This was beneficial for the company to raise funds to put towards further r&d (ranch and dicks). Although this initially dropped the stock price, it then rose to its ATH of $30.57 just 2 weeks later. The following drop from all-time high can be related to natural selling of the stock as well as a maxim group downgrade from a \u201cbuy\u201d to a \u201csell\u201d. This downgrade was most likely due to a dude with a less than average sized dick. It might also simply be attributed to the stocks very fast run up earlier this year, and is based solely on valuation. So, where are we today? Definitely not the Wendy's bathroom...anyway. Over the past five days, the stock price seems to have bounced off of a new low of $15.64 on June 22nd back to a price of $18.05 on June 24th. It has remained within this range over the past 3 days. What am I driving at here: Improvement in operating costs and increasing sales quarter over quarter show this company is becoming more efficient and are carving their name right into the fucking side of the augmented reality industry. Personally, I\u2019m expecting to see killer earnings in q3 2021. A new (as of 06/02/2021) medical electrical equipment safety standard certification will push this equipment directly into the new remote medical environment created by the COVID epidemic. Anyway, I\u2019m running out of steam. Maybe just ask Cathie Woods who bought the dip and added $13.5 million in Vuzix (as of 06/01) to the ARKW etf. She has previously added shares of Vuzix to the ARKQ fund as well. (I know, she didn't buy the top which in of itself shows some real development of her character) TLDR: Laser image eyeglass company lets surgeons cut people open better. A recent drop in share price provides a great entry point for a company with a great future.

{"text": "We have all heard it! -- \u201cTime in the market beats timing the market\u201d At the same time, we are all to some extent guilty of trying to time the market. The market always seems to break some new all-time high records, so we wait for the inevitable crash/pullback to invest. It\u2019s high time we put both strategies to test. Basically, what I wanted to analyze was Whether waiting for a crash to invest is a better investment strategy than staying invested? Analysis For this, let\u2019s take someone who started investing approximately 3 decades back (1993 to be exact). I created multiple investment scenarios as follows to understand the difference in returns if you a. Invested at the exact right time when markets were lowest that particular year b. Was extremely unlucky and just invested at the peak every year c. Did not care about timing the market and invested at a random date every year d. Just hoarded his cash and waited for a market crash to invest \\ For analysis simplicity, let\u2019s assume that you were on a conservative side, never picked individual stocks, and always made your investments to S&P500 \\. For investment amount, consider that you started with investing $10K in 1993 and increased your investments by 5% for every subsequent year. So, you made a total investment of $623K over the last 29 years. Results The analysis did throw up some interesting results. There\u2019s a lot to unpack here and let\u2019s break it down by each segment. The most important insight is that it\u2019s virtually impossible to lose money over the long term in the market \\. Even if you were the unluckiest person and invested exactly at the very top each year, you will still end up having a 263% return on your invested amount. At the opposite end of the spectrum, if you were somehow the luckiest person and invested only at the lowest point every year, you would have made a cool 100% more than someone who invested only at the top. Given both the hypothetical scenarios are extreme cases, let\u2019s consider some more realistic scenarios. If you did not care about timing the market and invested a fixed amount each month/year, you would still make a shade over 300% on your investments. Out of all the above scenarios, you would have made the most amount of money (a whopping 391% return) if you invested only during major crashes. In this type of investing, you would not invest in the stock market and keeps accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash. While this seems like a good idea, in theory, it\u2019s extremely difficult to execute properly in real life. The main limitations to investing during a crash strategy are a. The current returns are calculated by investing at the very bottom of the crashes. It\u2019s very difficult to identify the bottom of the crash while a crash is happening. You can end up investing midway through the crash and given that you are investing a significant chunk of capital you saved up, it can end up wiping out your portfolio. b. Identifying a crash itself is very hard As we can see from the above chart, the years that we consider were great for the market in hindsight still had significant drops within the same year. So even when the market is down 10%, it becomes extremely difficult to know whether it\u2019s going into a deeper crash or whether it\u2019s going to bounce back up. Conclusion While the analysis did prove that waiting for the crash is theoretically the best strategy returns-wise, practically it\u2019s very difficult to execute it. For e.g., even if you predicted the 2020 Coronavirus crash correctly, where would be your entry point? The market was down 15% by Mar 6th, another 10% by Mar 13th, and then another 10% by March 20th for a total of 35%. If you did not get in at the absolute bottom, you would have lost a considerable sum of your investment without actually getting any benefits from the previous run-up. It is extremely enticing to be the guy who called the crash correctly and even if you are right, only getting in at the absolute bottom would only give you the best returns. Adding to this, in the last 20 years, 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones \\. If you miss just any of those days waiting for an entry point, your returns would be substantially lower than someone who just stayed invested. If you think you are in the select few who have the skills to identify a crash and the temperament to see the crash through to invest at the very bottom, you will make an absolute killing in the market! For the rest of us, continuous investment regardless of the market trends seems to be the better choice.

{"text": "$GE has 120,000 naked calls sold between $14 and $14.5 for 6/11. I\u2019m not asking you beautiful apes to follow me to attempt a squeeze because it\u2019ll go up a few cents. This means that there are 12M shares to be covered if this closes above $14.5 on Friday. MMs are vulnerable which can be seen in the level two data. Statistically every morning 6M shares get shorted to dump the price. Before this was going on MMs left the price around $14 to get people to buy weekly calls thinking it\u2019ll pivot to a new leg. Naturally being the greedy assholes they are, after they sold 120,000 calls they tanked the price through a short attack. Ladder attacks typically involve two HFs working together to short and cover synthetic shares. This is just a huge short sell to stuff the price when volume is low in order. This is evident when you compare the volume in the first hours of trading to the last and the price action after hours. The stock always opens higher because all covering is done after hours where it can\u2019t get momentum. Best play possible is to let the shorts sell tomorrow morning to shove the price down. Once that happens a simple pump to the green will force the shorts to double. This always happens. Every single rally is shorted and all the good news is shorted. So it will happen. Once the shorts bring resistance you pull support and let the shorts tank it harder. Once the shorts have over extended a final pump to $14 will lock in the shorts with no money to continue to borrow, force them to cover, and bring the naked calls into the money. The naked calls are worth 12M shares if covered which that alone is 30% of daily volume. The shorts make up close to 40% of the daily volume on a low day like this entire week. That\u2019s 70% of fucking volume that needs to be covered if the stock closes at over $14 Friday. Not only will that be a huge loss to HFs, which we all love, but it\u2019ll be tendies because this thing is looking at a breakout to $20 if it passes the $14.72 level. By volume this stock is the most manipulated and a huge profit center for corrupt MMs and HFs. This can be turned as a tendie machine if squeezed. This only works with billions in shares bought and held. This is the mother of all squeezes because of the size of the float and market cap. This isn\u2019t something a few apes can do like $AMC or $CLOV. MMs are so scared that they put a 700k share sell wall 10 minutes before closing to not allow the share covering of the shorts to increase price and start a rally. This is a typical short attack to manipulate price to cover naked shorts. That\u2019s my DD on what I am seeing on this and this is the mother of all Wall Street manipulation. You want transfer of wealth this is it. Not financial advice. All that needs to be done is buy and hold $GE shares. Edit: DD on the company. It\u2019s a great long position, $GE is simplifying and repurchased $7B in debt, they are growing their energy sector with renewables and are building the largest wind farm in the world off the coast of northern England and the coast of California. They are also expanding energy with the purchase of SPX. The aviation industry is picking up and $BA and $EADSY have locked in orders. On the day that $BA got an order for 34 737 Max the price tanked because MMs know volume is low. But orders are coming in and the share price value is around $16. Healthcare developed and is about to release a new handheld ultrasound which will be ground breaking. The company also got tagged to help Ireland with the 5G deployment today and is teamed up with the 5G deployment in the US. A lot going for it in its recovery but float is large and MMs can borrow $GE very cheaply which is why it\u2019s so manipulated.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-06-10 07:21:23", "id": "nw5c9b"}

{"text": "In the EV Market, there are an increasing number of players vying for market share, so how is one to know which is the company to own if they wanted to consider investing? The answer is simply....research. And today, I'd like to share some of my own thoughts based on the research I have done to date. 1. Tesla has arguably been the King in the EV Space for some time now and minted some individuals a tidy profit if they stuck with the company through thick and thin. Being first in this space from a mass production standpoint, has worked well for them. However the crown is starting to tarnish. There are quality concerns, and recently the Model 3 lost Consumer Reports Top Pick Status and IIHS Safety Award after stripping features. Safety concerns with the Model 3 is a big PR problem especially in the world's largest market...China. China is also worried about government employees owning Teslas due to perceived security concerns with surveillance. One also must acknowledge that Tesla makes its money, not from selling cars, but from the \"regulatory credits\" it gets from governments around the world in their push to reduce carbon emissions. Since Tesla only sells electric vehicles, they get these credits for free and can sell them at a huge profit to other auto manufacturers who can't meet environmental targets. It's big $ for Tesla, but what one cannot look away from is the fact that Tesla IS NOT profitable from selling its cars. At least, not yet. 2. Now on to Chinese Car manufacturers...and there are quite a few. The big names are Buffet-loved and held, BYD. Li Auto which is relatively new, NIO which has some similar roots to Xpeng Motors, but isn't the same. All mentioned here are true EV plays. Xpeng/Tesla, and the race to autonomous driving. 3. Autonomous Vehicles is truly the next play in this market and a necessary move for vehicles to go in. Removing driver error is huge for safety and will save insurance companies a TON of money. And in the AV space, the race is between Tesla and Xpeng. 4. Not long ago, Musk charged Xpeng for stealing proprietary tech after a senior engineer left Tesla to join the Xpeng Team. Same was said about a senior Apple engineer who left Apple's Car R&D division and joined Xpeng as well. Tesla sued the engineer and the linchpin was on the AV tech housed in Xpeng's XPILOT software. Tesla argued that their tech was in their software. In the end, both companies agreed to allow an independent tech arbitrator to view both company's AV source code, and guess what....it was proven that both Tesla and Xpeng have their own source codes that were designed by their own R&D efforts, and nothing was stolen or was being shared. That was BIG News!! 5. Xpeng in the quest toward Phase 5 self driving cars, liked the safety and accuracy that LiDar tech provides. Musk, on the other hand, scoffed at LiDar for years calling it a 'fool's' play. However, years later, Musk is now conceding there is something to LiDar and may even be developing with it. But here is the rub, Xpeng has it, is using it, and their software works very very well with all the various sensors combined. Their new model, the P5, was showcased at the Shanghai Auto Show, complete with LiDar, and that show gave Xpeng 10,000 pre orders on reveal day alone. I can only imagine how that number has grown since, and in October, deliveries begin. 6. Xpeng has a new manufacturing facility set to go online in December of this year which will ramp up the ability to produce more cars. In 2022, they also have plans for 2-3 new models, one of which will be a new SUV type. 7. In the race toward full autonomous vehicle capabilities, Xpeng is targeting 2025 as the year for this to be fully operational, safe and complete. That said, they are logging thousands upon thousands of accident free XPILOT driver assisting kilometers with their cars doing a lot of the driving without needing help from the driver. No sleeping behind the wheel yet, but they are charting a significant course towards getting this done! Tesla? Well...when was the last time you heard of an accident or life lost? Probably not long ago, so they still have a long ways to go I think, and now Musk is backpeddling on his timelines for full AV capabilities. SCALE 8. Like China or not, with the GREEN push throughout the world and everything drivable going electric, there really is only ONE country that can help to meet the demand...China. They are a manufacturing powerhouse, and Xpeng is ramping up to get the world and humanity, the cars they need. SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE 9. A big hope for Tesla is that they can sell the software for their cars to have the capabilities they \u201ccan\" have. You want software assisted driving? That\u2019s going to cost you like 4 grand as an option. It\u2019s smart, if it works well. Xpeng has a similar hope, but is really successful already in this strategy. They also deploy OTA upgrades on what seems to be a weekly basis almost, which is exciting like when your phone gets an Over-the-Air update and new features, that same excitement is happening with XPeng\u2019s car owners, and it is translating into more sales. And while we are on the topic of sales, you can\u2019t help but notice that Xpeng was the first Chinese EV Car company to start selling vehicles in Europe in Norway, and plan to expand their distribution in more parts of Europe before the year is over. In Conclusion... Xpeng is an impressive company with huge goals for itself and they make technologically superior vehicles from many different angles. Entertainment, Drivability, Safety, Comfort, etc. I remember reading a quote of a comment that He Xiaopeng (Xpeng CEO and Founder) said to Musk, and it went something like this...\"We will destroy you in China, and we will be an absolute nuisance to you in Europe,\" and I think it won't be long, if not already, that He Xiaopeng lives up to his statement. Xpeng is worth a serious look and currently has price targets north of $50 USD. A great opportunity for a company of purchasing value today. Do your own research and I think you will come to see the true Tesla competitor, if not successor! (", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-06-17 13:08:26", "id": "o1lrzx"}

Which are essentially electric postal delivery style trucks. They also have a drone business called horsefly, which they claim can help with delivering packages. Finally they also have Metron, an app that can keep track of their trucks and monitor them to help with inefficiencies. \u200b Product Lineup if we take the $500,000 they made in Q1. This is absurd. They have been in business for years and still can't sell their products. ( The competition in the space is only increasing. Rivian, Lion Electric, Proterra, and Arrival are all joining the fray, except they already have partnerships with delivery giants. Arrival has a ( with UPS. ( and ( both have partnerships with Amazon. And all of them seemingly have a better growth ahead, even accounting for the higher valuations compared to Workhorse. Workhorse has never made a profit. The only time they had positive earnings is when their invest in Lordstown Motors blew up. Now RIDE is on the down tread. Their balance sheet is relatively healthy, and potentially a turn around could be possible, but unlikely. Back in October they sold 200 million in convertible notes, which are due 2024. They also have various other liabilities that total $204 million, including long-term. They have about $205 million in cash $200 million in Lordstown Motors. This is most of their liquid securities. Of course they could last a while with that much money right? Maybe. But things are still not good. In Q1 they lost $5.7 million in just cost of sales alone. This isn't even operating costs. For every dollar of sales, it cost them twelve dollars just to build. Of course this could be improved if they scaled up production, but they aren't receiving nearly enough sales to make a dent. The cashflows aren't looking good. They lost about $36 million in Q1 alone. That could mean they burn through $144 million in cash for 2021. They also have their drone project which continues to burn money as well, even with no potential near term. There was hope a few months ago. They could've won USPS, but probably due to their limited manufacturing capabilities, they didn't get and lost it to Oshkosh Corp. This was surprising to some. They seemed like the perfect fit for the new electric government vehicles. Lots of protest rose up over it from some government officials and Workhorse. However nothing has come out of it. I don't see a future where Workhorse gets the contract, unless the House can pass a bill forcing the USPS to go electric, but even then Oshkosh still might keep the contract.

{"text": "TL;DR: Ternium makes more than all of Yanksteel combined currently, has medium shart interest, a smaller market cap, AND it\u2019s at the same fucking price as it was 3 months ago (due to funds like Citadel shorting) despite MASSIVE steel price increases and a \u201cfuck you, pay me\u201d attitude. I intend to become rich off of this company. # This week was crazy. Do you want to make more money? Are you tired of endless shart sqioizle squirt trash comments? Do your wives have DDs? If any of these apply to you, then keep reading. \\\\CLF is still primed and ready to launch, but let me introduce you to his Mexican brother $TX (Ternium).\\\\ # Where and what the fuck is TX? Down in the lands of strippers, cocaine and cartels, TX produces flat steel and uses its own version of cocaine, coal coke. Ternium is Latin America\u2019s largest producer of flat steel and makes more than all of Yanksteel (American Steel) combined. Consumer goods production has continued to increase in Mexico over the past 25 years with post-corona recovery already in play. Mexico is back in business and Blast Furnaces, TX maximizes steel production output. EAFs use scrap metal while Blast Furnaces directly cook iron ore to make steel that\u2019s harder than your dicks when you see a \u201csHarT sQuEeZe\u201d post. Additionally, TX can be considered vertically integrated as they have a business dedicated to iron ore mining and production of something called Direct Reduced Iron (DRI), which can also be used in EAFs. The minimal waste of resources and maximized production is key to Ternium beating much of the steel industry. Every single item you use from lambos, appliances, home goods, and even electronics need this steel.We can see the effects of inflation and these rising prices as used cars are somehow appreciating in value and construction costs are going vertical. # Steel Goes BRRRRR: As you know, the steel industry is booming right now. HRC futures prices (Hot Rolled Coils) are through the roof, with nearly every month through 2022 above $1000, a 50% increase within the past 6 months. Because of both Buyden\u2019s infrastructure talks and sustained global demand as China plays games with exports and imports, the steel industry IS THE BEST SECTOR from an inflationary and money making machine standpoint. Inflation is not transitory as JPOW keeps lying to us, but will have long term consequences as the money printer continues to go brrr too. TX exports across the globe and operates specifically in Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, and Southern U.S. For the degenerates who actually use their brain cells, $TX is currently immune to tariffs. The Section 232 tariffs the U.S. placed on steel do not apply to the rest of North America aka Mexico and Canada. This means that all the steel produced there can be sold at full premium. If $TX is smart and follows through with opening an actual plant in the U.S. to pair with its U.S. operations, this would be in their best interest. As China continues to export less steel (with a potential export tax) and massive infrastructure plans about to be signed in place, $TX has a golden opportunity to produce massive steel dildos of profits. # Financials: $TX was basically immune to coronavirus. You could give this bitch the Indian triple variant and it would still pump out profits like there\u2019s no tomorrow. Argentina and Brazil continued to have strong construction and home demands, and as a result, in Q1 of 2021, Ternium had an EPS of $3.07, a 45% increase from the previous quarter, beating estimates by 36%. Just like every other steel company, TX is taking the \u201cfuck you, pay me\u201d approach. As steel prices continue to rise, so does TX\u2019s offering of flat steel. It\u2019s like an infinite tendie machine. \\##Analyst ANALysis: \u201c$TX (Ternium S.A.) has a Q2 2021 EPS estimate of $3.42 (only a slight increase over their Q1 $3.07 EPS number). This appears absurdly low which will mean another high percentage beat by $TX as analysts are surprised once again.\u201d \\- u/BlueWolf1983 Using some of his mathemagical skills, he determined that half of their Q2 sales should be based on previous Q1 prices. That appears to be somewhere in the $1200s. Assuming a Q1 2021 price of $1210 and an average Q2 2021 spot price of $1490, this would be a price of $1,350 per ton. Again, based on these prices, he then calculated the following: \u201cIn the following chart, I've further added their cost per ton by taking the cost of their steel sales in Q1 of 2020 and dividing it by their total steel shipments. As they mentioned input costs would marginally increase, I've given that roughly a flat 5% 10% input cost increase. As on their Q2 call they mentioned input price increases lag due to existing inventory + reserves and as they mine their own ore, that should be sufficient.\u201d \u200b |Country|Shipments (in thousands of tons )|Q2 2021 Estimated Ton Price|Q2 2021 Cost Per Ton Estimate|Profit Per Ton|Total Profit (in Millions)| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Mexico|1699|$1,350|$770|$580|$985.42| |Southern Region|680.8|$1,210|$770|$440|$299.56| |Other Markets|687.7|$1,100|$770|$330|$226.94| It appears they sell electricity in Mexico and Brazil as well. This is way too hard to try to figure out a Q2 estimate for. As this seems to range between 44M and 59M in profits for them, we will just add 50M to get a new total profit of: $1,566.92M. Doing more math that went slightly over my head, the final EPS calculated should be: $4.48. This is all based on data approximately 1 month old, which means the EPS would likely be higher. From a conservative standpoint, this is another 35% beat of the previous quarter\u2019s EPS. # Mega Shart Interest Stats: Currently, the shart interest on TX is ranging around 15%. In the past month alone, the number of shares sharted increased by about 10%. Shart Volume Graph despite MASSIVE steel price increases and a \u201cfuck you, pay me\u201d attitude. I intend to become rich off of this company. My Positions: 10 contracts of 8/20 50C I will be averaging in with about 50 more contracts of the September 45Cs too. Thanks to u/JayArlington and u/Bluewolf1983 for data and inferences made throughout this post. Thanks to u/Dan_inKuwait for helping get this approved. TL;DR If you like money, buy into steel or $TX.

They were able to acquire an initial stake from Roivant and have increased their stake since with another planned purchase of over a million shares coming before the end of the year. They are also very likely to buyout the company, but this is explained in more detail down below. Other Institutions - Theres a nice large chunk of other institutions like Takeda (held by ark) and a few others who own a position here. In fact, so many other institutions are holding, that the shares available to retail are about 5% of the company! To put that into perspective, amc is an 80% retail float. Follow the big money here. The current valuation: Right now, the current market cap from a very basic perspective is sitting at $1.8b. The company currently has $725m of this in cash with more to come upon completion of future milestones from Pfizer (management has called these \"Achievable\" in past calls) as well as sales from their drug. This means the company is sitting on close to 40% of its market cap in cash. To expand, each of the use cases approved is expected to see more than 1b a year in net revenue within the next few years. So what do analysts on WS think? Consensus is in mid 30s (50% more than current) with Evercore ISI projecting a $55 PT and another firm at $42! could make an entrance. The future prospects: By the end of June they are expected to submit an NDA for relugolix for the treatment of Endometriosis. This is likely to be approved as their data has been incredibly strong (triple threat) and they already have relugolix approved on the market. Further, the company has 2 peer reviewed publications on relugolix in the New England Journal of medicine for its possibility as a standard of care treatment.

You get a preliminary offer based on area and comps 2. You talk to a team member and discuss a time for a 30 min walkthrough while they inform you of what the process will be like. 3. Video walkthrough via zoom or stream on device of your choice with a \"housing expert\" who looks at the entire house including plumbing, appliance dates, wall dings etc etc 4. You get final offer with repairs and closing cost included. Now between the three Opendoor takes 5% for service charge, plus added $2200 repair cost and 1% for closing cost. They also gave a larger prelim offer (477k) after walk through went to 460k (bait and switch) Zillow on the other hand gave 457k preliminary offer, post walkthrough it stayed at 457k no repair cost (home was built in 2016) and they only take 1% for service charge! -- **Note still waiting on final from redfin just did final walkthrough. Now my question is how the hell does Opendoor last when they are heavily reliant on their tech and boast that it's superior but the heavy hitter in this industry is now doing it just as good but for 5% or more less?! As mentioned, makes me want to put a couple puts on it and see what happens. All opinions appreciated!", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-06-24 09:53:24", "id": "o6o1x1"}
{"text": "I would like to draw your attention to a trading strategy that we call the Gungan, also known as \"trading the Jar Jar\". That could be of use here. This is when the stock chart manifests the outline of Jar Jar Binks, true hero of the Star Wars saga who first appeared in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, a Gungan who became a Senator, and was instrumental in the Clone Wars, Chancellor Palpatine's rise to power, and the ultimate destruction of the Galactic Republic. Some recent examples of Gungans include BlackBerry (BB), Tesla (TSLA), and Twitter (TWTR). When a stock manifests this pattern, it experiences three (3) distinct stages. Each stage corresponds to a quote by Jar Jar Binks in the Star Wars movies: Stage 1. from Jar Jar Binks' right ear to his right eye: >\"Yousa Follow Me Now, Okeyday?\" In other words follow Jar Jar, the stock share price is on an accelerating, upward trend and it is rational to buy. Stage 1., consider selling. ( Stage 4. from Jar Jar Binks' left eye to left ear: >\"Wesa Dyin' Here.\" In other words Jar Jar is informing you that the share price is plunging and if you haven't already, you should sell by now. ( Trading the Jar Jar is a very complex financial strategy, however this pattern works because, like Jar Jar Binks, the stock market is retarded.

{"text": "Hello, fellow apes. This sub has been bringing up one of my favorite stocks right now, CRSR, which although undervalued by almost any metric (the street target is sitting at about $47 - right at ATH and 50% upside) yet has been trading flat in the low 30s range. I want to talk about why it stayed so steady, why this makes it the PERFECT opportunity for entry (especially on leaps- low IV on the contracts, but short-term theta is a killer). \u200b Background: Since CRSR IPO'd in 2020, it has done nothing but surprise investors. Posting its first profitable year, increasing revenues, and paying off debt. Not to mention they threw a few acquisitions in there to further diversify the business. Originally investors were amazed, which caused over a 200% rally in share price. Why it's Flat: Since then, the market has been too worried about the vaccines and reopening efforts hurting their sales. But as we have all probably realized over the past year and a half - gaming, streaming, and building computers AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE. If anything there are more consumers interested than ever before. CRSR has also taken steps to expand its business and establish itself as one of the biggest sponsors in streaming. Think of Nike or Red Bull - but for Esports. By growing their sponsored gamer teams, they attract the next generation of gamers and consumers who want to have the same products as their favorite gamers - the same way you still buy Jordans. Factors for Moon: The most obvious is the fundamental undervaluation for CRSR. While most stocks keep pushing higher, CRSR has not seen love for months, even after posting great earnings at the beginning of May. While AMD has begun to rally and NVDA hits new ATH, people fail to realize that as they grow so does CRSR. What happens when NVDA or AMD comes out with a new product people buy? They get some CRSR accessories and peripherals to go with their new devices. The market is failing to see the amazing opportunity right in front of it. Let us not forget the 22% short interest ratio, which is why the rally last week couldn't hold. The rally also had 20x the average daily volume, if the market begins to realize CRSRs potential soon that type of volume will be normal, and so will a price between $45-$58 (my own targets from DCF model built). Yet again, what do I know - I'm a retarded finance student (how did I even get to college) and I eat crayons. Therefore this is not financial advice. TLDR; I believe CRSR is insanely undervalued and it's only a matter of time before it takes off. \u200b This is my first public DD, I enjoyed writing it, I hope you all enjoy it and let me know what your thoughts. Excited to discuss it down below! ( \u200b EDIT: There's a lot of talk about Eagletree's ownership of CRSR and how that's holding it down but as far as I can tell this is all a rumor. If you look through their Investor Rights Agreement SEC Filing, all that is specified is they remain in control of certain things unless they own less than 3% of common stock, but there is no requirement for them to ever sell any stake. Everything they have a say in keeps CRSR in check and honestly betters the company, but that's about it.

{"text": "Ok, first off. The volume on UWMC today was just fucking pathetic. I mean just fucking embarrassing. Let me tell you why we are missing a simple, straight forward, trip to tendie town. UWMC has had a nice run over the last month, up about 25% over that time and up 10% over the last week. This has run the share price to over $10 per share making the potential for us to get a little sweet gamma action with the 6/18 contracts looming. Open interest on ITM calls is getting interesting. Already over 100k contracts are in the money, mostly between 9c and 10c. You could see the price action today as they try to beat the price down to 10.00 one last time (and the piss poor volume is making it easy for them) before hedging some of these positions. If we were to get over 11.00 by EOW, that's another 60k open interest on the 11c alone!! and this will force more buying to cover these contracts. You know what happens from here. This is why we are here. The problem is the lack of volume. Again, 10 million volume today, for fuck sake people. With a float of 90m shares (I don't want to start a pissing match, but much smaller than CLOV and CLNE), this thing is not hard to move. With 25m volume on 6/9 we had an 8% move. With volume of 13m on 6/11 another 6% jump. After today the share price is sitting just above 10. I am a retard, and not a mathematician, but another 10% by EOW and then we party. Hookers, blow, whatever you want. Ill cover this just cuz I know you retards get hard over the potential. >15% short float. Not why I am here, but you never know once this things gets moving. Nextly, the calls because this is a casino after all. 7/16 calls are very reasonable, fuck, I'd call them a god damn bargain for the potential we are looking at here. This thing has yet to lift off and the IV is still reasonable enough to jump on this gamma rocket. Last point I will make. UWMC is actually a solid company. I am not covering the fundamentals a ton, but holding a $10 UWMC bag is a lot more attractive than others I have seen gain steam recently. 4% dividend, upcoming 300m in share buy back, Revenue and EPS doubled from Q1 2020 to Q1 2021. Not even you can fuck this up. You make money now, you make money later, your kids make money in 20 years from your wise decision this week. Get a forward from your wife's bf on this weeks allowance and get you some of this action. Positions: 150 shares at 8.20 average, (24) 7/16 calls at various strike.

I am sharing a simple summary that may help to draw a clear and simple picture based on public data. - 501,780,240 shares outstanding as of June 2, 2021 - approximately 4.1 million1 individual shareholders eligible to vote at the upcoming Shareholder Meeting - More than 80% of AMC shares are held by a broad base of retail investors with an average holding of around 120 shares. Shares held by retail investors ~ 80% x 501,780,240 ~ 401,424,192 - As of June 9th, 2021 from a top brokerage firm: Institutional Stock Ownership 12.6% Institutional Mutual Fund Ownership 10.4% Mutual Fund Ownership 3.2% Insider Ownership 6.5% Other 67.4% Total of institution ownership: 12.6% + 10.4% + 3.2% = 26.2% Total of the rest excluding individual retail investors: 26.2% + 6.5% = 32.7% Equivalent number of shares covered by record excluding shares from individual owners: 32.7% x 501,780,240 = -164,082,138 shares Shares needed to cover the records: -63.72M = 501.78M - 401.42M - 164.08M - Synthetic shares: total number of synthetic shares: Z naked shorts: X naked call contracts: Y other naked shares: W Z = X + Y + W Short interest: Assuming 21% SI which is about 100.4M shares Minimum number of synthetic shares from public records: 100.4M - 63.72M ~ 37M (assume all 63.72M shares were still amid transactions, this is very unlikely) Hidden number of synthetic shares: U: a lot discussions in forums estimate that this number is huge. Minimum number of synthetic shares 37M + U - Bottom line: 37M or MUCH MUCH MORE synthetic shares will have to be covered by real shares, most of these shares need to be from individual investors.

{"text": "Summary: Synthetic Biology is a field in science focused on reprogramming micro organisms (yeast) to produce things like CBG or vanillin, rather than making alcohol. Its simple, feed cells sugar and they make whatever you want (because their DNA is rewritten). This field has been around for a while but has had recent breakthroughs that make it poised to become the next big thing. In this example I will use cannabinoid fermentation as a base on how to evaluate these companies. I will be using Amyris in examples because they are one of the few companies that releases their stats. \u200b The Goal: Try to create a strain of yeast that makes a lot of product (CBG) as efficiently as possible. \u200b Old Method: At its core, synthetic biology is reprogramming the DNA of yeast. You make some edits to DNA and you select the best performing strain, rinse and repeat and pray you get the best performing strain before you run out of money. That's the core of it, editing and screening/selecting strains. \u200b New Method: Its still the same reprogramming, the difference now is that the editing is quicker (thanks to CRISPR and genetic programming). The screening/selection is now boosted by machine learning. Machine learning uses a vast database to pick the promising strain candidates early on - this is one of the most important pieces. To give you a sense of how much quicker the process is - Amyris is doing 1500 DNA designs (edits) every cycle (two weeks) and their computers are selecting <0.1% of 7.2 Million candidates screened per year. \\------------------------------------------ \u200b Critical Components to Understand Scaling: Yield: how much CBG the microbes can produce. Scale: process of editing and selecting strains to have high yield in bigger fermentation tanks (100L, 10,000L, 200,000L). Bigger tanks = higher efficiency = $$$$$ Companies will get a High Yield strain and then try to Scale that strain. That's right, its not as simple as just putting the little bastards in a bigger tank \\- you have to also fight evolutionary pressure. Making yeast produce CBG is sort of like if you engineered chickens to shit out pineapples. Think of how much work and energy it would take that chicken to make a single pineapple, it would be slow and clunky - this is the problem high yield yeast face in the tank. As yeast multiply there can evolve unproductive strains that expend less energy and can grow at a faster rate than the high yield yeast - unproductive yeast can take all the resources and ruin your batch. Evolutionary pressure is one of the biggest challenges to scaling and is more problematic the bigger scale you go. \\------------------------------------------ \u200b Critical Components to Evaluating a Synbio Company: 1. Current Scale: what size tanks are they currently producing at? 2. Time to Scale: how long have they been working on scaling? how fast do they get to bigger tanks? If its slow, they will be burning cash. 3. Costs of Product: How good is their yield per Liter? OR Cost of product per unit (how much they will charge for a kilogram of CBG). Companies do not like sharing this info, if they do, they are probably bragging. Synbio companies are capable of creating virtually any molecule through this scaling process. It sounds like some kind of science fiction thing, but it is here now and very real. Now that you know more of this field, here are some of the top players and their CBG stats. ||Current Scale (L)|Time to Current Scale|Costs of Product| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Amyris|220,000|1 year|\\~$500/kg| |Ginkgo|50,000|2.7 years|Won't say| |Demetrix|15,000|1.5 years|Won't say| |Creo (CBG/A)|12,500|\\~5 years|Won't say| |Willow|10,000|\\~1 year|Won't say| \u200b Its not about who is first, it is about who is fastest to scale. \u200b Common Misunderstandings: \"Commercial scale\" - It's a big milestone but FAR from the finish line. Commercial scale means that the product (CBG) can cover the costs of the supply (sugar). Much more scaling has to be done in order to improve margins and have a true product that can make money. Scaling does not end once it is in a biggest tank either, it keeps going in cycles. Amyris launches a campaign every 3-4 months - each campaign resulting in \\~50% COGS reduction, approaching the cost of sugar. THAT is the type of sexy number you are looking for. \"Purity\" - yeast already produce things like insulin and other medical ingredients, purification isn't a big deal these days. If your scaling process is true, you should already be having excellent purity by fighting off evolutionary pressure. \\------------------------------------------ END: The science behind ALL of these companies is amazing and I wish the best for all of them. They all have made major achievements to get this far. The Synbio World has room for many players. If you have any competing stats and want it known, comment below and include citation. I am happy to include it if it is relevant. \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- More on Amyris for those obsessed like me... Some of you may be wondering why Amyris is so far ahead. It is simple, Amyris has been doing this since 2003. They practically invented the scale up process around 2011 and got it to a reliable state in 2016. That is why Amyris is years ahead of all of its competition, it literally had a head start. It will take years for any other company to gather the required data for their selection process to be equivalent to Amy's. \u200b On Management... Management did whatever they could to keep the lights on. Anyone burned by that deserved it because we all should have done better DD - the financials were disgusting. The Amyris that rose from those ashes is a whole new beast though. I think these next ERs will prove that. \u200b On Lavvan Lawsuit I am not a lawyer, but I am not concerned with this lawsuit. I believe it to be frivolous. We see Amyris going ahead with CBG so their lawyers must believe they have a strong case. RCL Agreement: [ When we went through the RCL agreement, we noticed something interesting... The ONLY time CBG was mentioned in the agreement is where it is excluded from \"additional cannabinoids\". So if it doesn't belong under \"Commercial Cannabinoids\" or \"Additional Cannabinoids\" it is not included in the agreement... its in a grey area and Amyris can do whatever it wants. That is my interpretation. \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b Oh and Lavvan's own lawyers are suing each other other. \u200b \u200b \\----------------------------------------------------------------- Interesting thing to note: Ginkgo and Cronos pushed their production ahead of schedule. It looks like they are having some trouble scaling at the 50,000L tank level and something spooked them to capture the market quicker. Maybe some company producing CBG for $500/kg scared them? Amyris should be pushing it well below $500 in the future. \u200b", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-06-10 06:47:44", "id": "nw4l5z"}

It has 519 issued patents and pending patent applications related to their CGM system and has burned through $648 MM since its inception just to get to where we are now. The almost demise of Senseonics in 2020 was due to some self inflicted errors and bad luck. The company tried to commercialize Eversense on its own in the USA and that consumed much of its economic resources without much success and then, when COVID hit, the company stopped commercializing Eversense as it couldn't get physicians to perform the sensor implant procedure. In March 2020, Senseonics was forced to make a $48.5 MM repayment to one of its lenders that panicked and that pushed the company into the limits of insolvency and forced it to look for a partner or outright sale. Therefore, there's a lot of upside for SENS including a potential short squeeze which may happen as the short interest is more than 25%.

{"text": "Ahoy there fellow autists, its ye swashbuckling DD writer back from the Seven Seas. After spending two weeks in rough waters hunting for a play profiting off of JPOW\u2019s money printer inflation, me ship has settled on the docks of ZIM International Shipping Services Ltd.

Again, nothing written here is financial advice. Furthermore, please leave any politics at the door or I will personally make sure you are banned for unnecessary discourse. Furthermore, even with a market cap of $5B the options chain has high OI already on long term calls and higher premiums, helping avoid the risk of algos messing with the stock. Positions or Ban: - Disclosure - I own 25 shares of ZIM and 4 calls. # Who be the Jolly ZIM? Check out the CEO's new whip\ud83c\udfce\ufe0f , and settled at a share price of $15. As of today, Zim is up about 300% due to extreme shipping bottlenecks and sheer demand of goods as Captain JPOW ignores what can only be described as Inflation Nation. However, as you hornswogglers abandoned the value ship for riskier assets like $CUMMIES, $ZIM has proved itself to be the mightiest in the seas. The Pirates of the Zimmabean have a vast network that rivals that of Jack Sparrow and his whores. With trade across nearly every shipping route, the world is $ZIMs oyster and the seas are its bitch... Due to increased good prices, they are primarily profiting off of Asia-United States trade routes and Southeast Asian intra-trades. To date, they have approximately 99 vessels, 11 main trade networks, and hundreds of different sub-routes within these networks to major cities and capitals all around the globe. \u200b The Pirates of the Zimmabean have taken over the African coast and Southeast Asia with ease. . 1. Retail inventories are at their lowest in nearly 25-30 years based on shipping orderbook-to-fleet ratios. This metric measures the number of container, drybulk, and tanker orders relative to the number of pirate ships available to fulfill said orders. However, over the past decade since 2009, many shipping companies went bankrupt as container prices continued to lower while demand was met. This leaves $ZIM in a prime position to capture even more niche locations of the market. Furthermore, the average duration to build new ships is approximately two years, indicating that until 2023, the supply of global cargo ships will remain the same. 2. Due to commodity prices rising for both lumber and steel, the cost of the average LNG powered ship is being renegotiated constantly. To date, a large LNG powered container and drybulk ship costs double what it originally did, going from about $100M for a state of the art version to $200M currently. Arrrgh, that\u2019s right mateys, inflation nation is here. 3. Based on Harpex data, these values are based on the cost of chartering the ships themselves.Currently, the cost to charter an 1,100 TEU ship is $18,750 USD per day, and the cost to charter an 8,500 TEU ship is $71,000 per day. This indicates that charter rates are triple and quadruple the average rates over the past decade. Rates only peaked this high around 2007 near the previous commodities boom. # ZIM Be Looting The Seas: Remember this fucker? He be the sealubber delivering your Amazon Prime dildos. , containerships are always transporting and have continuous shipments for multiple years. In terms of contracts, much of $ZIM\u2019s 99 vessels are already booked through 2023 and potentially 2024 if rates sustain themselves. In the overall global trade market, $ZIM is a smaller player, which surprisingly gives them an advantage. They have 20% of shipment capacity in long-term contracts and 80% in short-term contracts. The Chad CEO, Eli Glickman, has already clarified that most of their charter contracts are short-term because he sees high rates persisting for a long time. This means he can suck more money out of his clients in the short-term because they are desperate for ZIM\u2019s services while ZIM has the upper ground. Additionally, long-term contracts generally come with a discount for the client since they ensure multi-year business for the shipping company. ZIM plays it smart by taking advantage of all the short term players who will pay a high premium for any charter service needed. Furthermore, $ZIM also caters to lots of smaller trade routes including intra-continental shipments. As mentioned above, some of their best charters are between various Southeast Asian countries and African ports as well. By focusing on both smaller and major trading routes, $ZIM is able to avoid many of the cascading backlog effects since there are less containerships operating in their waters. Based on charter versus order data, many of ZIMs older vessels are also being retired and therefore scrapped, which may actually help reduce backlog and make their newer updated ships much more profitable. However, ZIM continues to expand as well. It is now one of the biggest importers between Asia and the US East Coast with direct shipments to NYC and Savannah. They have also begun to send smaller containerships on routes between Taiwan and Oakland for Pacific shipments, which helps avoid the many, many backlogs other shipment companies are facing in L.A. and San Francisco.* (I will discuss this next). # Coastal Mutiny: \u201cUh\u2026. Captain? I don\u2019t think your wife is going to get those limited edition Pickle Rick butt plugs in time.\u201d a total of 121 sailings into the \\ West Coast and 21 into the East Coast. As demand remains at an all-time high and backlogs in Asia continue to expand, the most common question remains why? The answer is directly tied to congestion levels across the entire network. One well documented and most clearly visible factor are the port delays which on average stands anywhere between 1-3 weeks across the West Coast. With each vessel making multiple stops, this naturally prevents them from being able to return to Asia to meet their next rotational departure. The outcome is an increase in what is described as a slide sailing. This occurs when all vessels on a string are in principle late due to the many delays, and as a measure to resolve the situation, one or more planned sailings will have to be removed to realign the schedules. \u201c Ports and vessels continue to face COVID outbreaks due to the nature of their international trips, forcing temporary stops, quarantines, and ultimately delays in the overall market. However, what this does accomplish is more long-term shipping rates at high levels due to low inventory yet high demand and purchases. Competitors like Maersk Shipping are operating on 20% reduced capacity while $ZIM continues to increase the number of routes and vessels being employed due to their mixed small and large route shipping strategy, helping them bang bardy wenches and gain massive booty. # Massive Booty Growth: Alrighty MATEYS, it is time to do the annual counting of the booty. The Pirates of the Zimmabean have banged mums, shipped goods, and looted tendies throughout the year for financial success that Jack Sparrow himself would nut for. In the first quarter, $ZIM beat predicted EPS by 25% for a total of $5.13 relative to $4.09 predicted. They also beat revenue with a posting of nearly $1.7B. For the entirety of 2021, the forecasted EBITDA has also doubled since previous targets, to approximately $3.3B relative to $ZIM\u2019s own guidance of approximately $2.5B, indicating a 32% increase. Borrowing graphs from another post, ( ( Looking at $ZIM\u2019s debt and leverage ratios, its competitors generally have about 3-5x debt-to-equity ratios after needing to raise capital and pay off business costs as a result of low investments in shipping. ZIM on the other hand stuck its golden crow up every crevice of the industry and maintains a 1.2 debt-to-equity ratio, a 66% decrease from 2 years ago. In one year they payed off nearly 2 years of debt and continue to pay it off using the funds raised from this years growth. It is important to note that this ratio is also lower than what most companies of similar size have. $ZIM also repaid $75M in bonds back to $DAC in April, which will also be beneficiary towards Q2 earnings. ZIM\u2019s market cap is around $5B while they have nearly $881 million in Free Cash Flow. This is a ratio of about 5.67 which is quite good for most companies, and especially good for the shipping industry. Given current rate prices, it would not be surprising that this ratio goes down to about 3. Further comparing this value to ZIM\u2019s forecasted EBITDA of $3.3 Billion by Citi Bank, and taxes of approximately 8.3%, the forecasted earnings for this year are approximately $3.02B which is nearly 60% of ZIM\u2019s current market cap. Using this value and the number of shares currently as approximately 114,508,115, the final predicted EPS based on current guidance is about 26.37. # With a potential EPS of 26.37, about 30-50% percent is being distributed as dividend, indicating a lower dividend of $7.91 per share and an average of $10.5 per share which is 24.5% yield. This is unheard of in terms of dividend and may attract Old Man Boomer as well. Note: ZIM has already paid a $2 special dividend this year and plans to do so again in September. # Assuming an average P/E of 3 based on current values, ZIM could be worth up to $79 by the end of the year, or about 83.7% upside. However, I believe that factoring in conservative estimates and it\u2019s already 300% growth this year, $ZIM has a fair value around $60, which is still a 39% upside. # The Microsoft of Shipping: The Pirates of the Zimmabean learned the ways of electric dildos and cancer causing cellular waves and have utilized this \\~cutting edge\\~ technology to maximize the customer experience. Most companies be using old-fangled 1950\u2019s technology and wooden sticks for sexy times late at night. ZIM is beyond that.

{"text": "Today we\u2019ll take a dive into JMIA (Jumia) Africa\u2019s biggest e-commerce company. I have a lot of experience in population growth and economic development in developing countries. Africa is poised to be the next area of rapid economic growth, now that places like China/Vietnam are having a slow down. Most continent\u2019s populations will falter over the next half century, the majority of growth will take place on the African Continent - \ud83d\udcf7 ( I am betting on JMIA holding down and expanding their footprint on the African continent as they poise themselves to grow along with the continent. TLDR - Ideal stock for day trading as it bounces like a kangaroo. Otherwise I'd go long, leaps and shares What\u2019s Jumia? Jumia is Africa\u2019s biggest e-commerce company. Its core business is focused in 11 countries on the continent representing around 70% of Africa's GDP and population. Nigeria, Kenya, Senegal, South Africa, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Uganda, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Ghana. They have been expanding rapidly to get their foot down in as many countries as possible without stretching themselves too thin. They have a business model similar to ebay, in that many products are sold by private sellers. Since the start of the pandemic, they have pivoted their business to also deliver groceries as well as take-out food. Nigeria is Jumia\u2019s biggest market so here is their website if you would like to pursue phones, penis pills, or clothing. Browsing their website you can get an idea of where they\u2019re pivoting their business. Nigerian Website - ( can give you an idea of problems that Jumia was facing. As you can see in that video the biggest issue they\u2019ve had since starting their business is getting packages into people\u2019s hands at a faster rate. According to their ( Jumia has 1,600 pick up stations across Africa, something which they didn\u2019t even have in 2019. It is the same concept as Amazon Lockers, where a person\u2019s goods are put in a locker to be picked up at their convenience. 23% of packages delivered in Q1 were to pick up stations. During their Q1 earnings, the company stated the potential of their pick up stations \u201cWe view pick-up stations as a strategic asset for the future growth of our platform. In addition to providing more convenience options for consumers and cheaper delivery costs, they are physical touch points that bring the Jumia brand closer to consumers. We are increasingly leveraging them as ordering points where consumers can place orders with the help of the pick-up station staff which helps educate consumers and build further trust.\u201d To give you an idea of their use in more remote regions - \u201csome countries such as Ivory Coast, pick-up stations are proving to be a compelling alternative to door delivery and a key tool to expand e-commerce penetration beyond primary cities. We see meaningful opportunity in supporting equitable economic development in secondary cities and rural areas, which led us to establish a scalable pick-up station model in partnership with CDC, the UK\u2019s development finance institution. These outlets serve as both pick-up stations and ordering points. They are operated by local entrepreneurs who earn income from the delivery fees they receive on package delivery and commissions on orders placed from the outlet.\u201d To show what they mean, here is a long list of pick up stations in Kenya- ( with the CEO on Kenyan Public Television, he explains the success they have had during the pandemic. As you can tell, JMIA is coming out to take over the e-commerce space in Africa. While they have smaller/regional competitors, none of them have the footprint and services like Jumia. Which is what makes me extremely bullish on JMIA in the long term. My conviction to go long on JMIA is from my understanding of the long-term growth and development that will take place in Africa. Jumia stands to profit immensely from any development in Africa and will continue to dominate the e-commerce space as more Africans enter the middle class and want to enjoy the same convenience/luxuries available in The West. They have shown they're capable of pivoting quickly when needed to fit the ever changing needs of the respective countries they operate in. Two of the biggest takeaways from the UN's 2050 agenda is that by 2050 two in every five children will be born in Africa and that Urban population is expected to triple. In Africa, the average age is 19 years old and rapidly getting younger. The continent is growing so quickly that by halfway through this century, it will be home to one billion children. This article from the economist is a great example of the growth that will occur in Nigeria alone - [ While Africa is always slept on when considering business and commerce, it is one of the last places to be underdeveloped and will bloom once more manufacturing is relocated to the continent after wages and standard of living rises high enough in East/SE Asia. Similarly to how many things were made in Taiwan/South Korea, which then moved to China and now to Vietnam. As wages rise in these places, manufacturers will move to Africa in order to take advantage of lax labor laws and low wages, spurning the continent\u2019s industrial boom. Short-Term Potential Roadblocks - While the pandemic has slowed down in the United States, the large majority of Africans are unvaccinated. Which means that many countries have/are under travel restrictions and may affect business in the short-term. However Jumia has fared well over the last year so I believe they are capable of overcoming any of those challenges in the short term. I am not into astrology so I wont draw any lines on any charts. This is great stock to make little trades on here and there because of its volume. However at under 3 billion dollar market cap, I consider this a great time to invest. I will continue to buy more shares weekly and scalp calls here and there. Positions - 60 shares and 8/20 $35c Eyeing 12/17/2021 40c & 50c - I am confident in JMIA reaching that range by EOY.

{"text": "The mega-merger deal between Canadian cannabis companies Aphria and Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) was the highlight of the marijuana industry this year. The deal closed on May 3 and the \"new\" Tilray was formed, and in the process, became the world's largest cannabis company by revenue. The legacy Aphria has always been a strong contender in the cannabis space because of its smart growth strategies. Legacy Tilray, on the other hand, was a rather small company, which had a market cap of $1.1 billion before the merger was announced, but now holds a market cap of $7.7 billion. This brought the newly combined company closer to the two leaders in the cannabis space: U.S. cannabis company Curaleaf Holdings, with a market cap of $9.5 billion, and Ontario, Canada-based Canopy Growth, with a market cap of $9.0 billion. Since this was a reverse merger, the legacy Aphria's management holds the decision-making powers. In fact, Aphria's shareholders now own 62% of the new company, with Irwin Simon (Aphria's CEO and chairman) leading the combined entity. Here are all the ways Tilray can benefit from this merger, and why this business is a smart buy for the long term. What's in this merger deal for Tilray? Mergers and acquisitions are not uncommon in the marijuana industry. Before this merger, Aphria acquired American craft beer maker SweetWater Brewing in November 2020 to make an entry into the U.S. cannabis beverage market. Beverages are part of cannabis derivatives (vapes, edibles, concentrates, and more), additional recreational products that Canada legalized in October 2019. Tilray had already made an entry into this category in October with a new line of cannabis-infused edibles through its wholly owned subsidiary High Park Holdings. By pooling its resources and capital, the combined company can launch even more derivatives, competing with peers like Canopy that are rapidly expanding in this segment In its recent fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 results, the legacy Tilray recorded a 20.5% year-over-year jump in revenue to $57 million. For the full year, the company reported a 26% increase in revenue to $210 million from 2019. Tilray also saw a positive adjusted EBITDA (earnings before income, tax, depreciation, and amortization) of $2.2 million, compared to a loss of $35.3 million in the year-ago period. This was Tilray's first quarter of positive EBITDA before merging with Aphria -- and it is a good start. Aphria has been generating positive adjusted EBITDA over the past seven quarters. Now, Aphria's strong balance sheet and its management driving the bus can make the new Tilray a profitable cannabis company. (EBITDA measures a company's operational performance, whereas true profitability is the total earnings after all deductions are made.) By merging with Aphria, Tilray has equipped itself to both expand and grow. A steady hand on the wheel A bigger company has some benefits -- access to a lot of resources, manpower, and capital. But bigger is not always better. A bigger company can also be difficult to manage. It could face complications with cost synergies, hidden inefficiencies, merger costs, and personnel. That's why Irwin's leadership is so important -- we can expect the company to smoothly handle any challenges. As CEO, Irwin successfully founded and led consumer goods company Hain Celestial Group to success before doing the same for Aphria. Aphria survived and thrived amid a global crisis because of Simon and his leadership team's smart growth strategies of focusing on their core operations and strengthening their brands and balance sheet, rather than spending cash haphazardly on acquisitions. It appears Simon plans to follow the same strategy for new Tilray -- building its existing brands and focusing on its roots in Canada. On June 8, Tilray launched a new medical cannabis brand, Symbios, and a high-potency medical cannabis topical under the Aphria brand for the Canadian market. A smart buy for the long term The European cannabis market could grow at a compound annual growth rate of 29.6% to be worth $37 billion by 2027. This could be a lucrative opportunity for Tilray. Simon expects to use Tilray's Portugal facility to help in expanding into the European market. The company holds a cultivation license from the government of Portugal to produce medical marijuana products and export them throughout the continent. Aphria already has a strong market presence in the medical cannabis business not only in Canada and Europe, but also in Africa, South America, and Oceania. It generates close to 97% of its distribution revenue from its Germany-based subsidiary, CC Pharma. With prospects of federal legalization in the U.S. also strengthening, the new Tilray could be a strong contender in the U.S. cannabis market five years down the line. In the meantime, the European, international, and Canadian markets can be its revenue growth driver for now. We will know more about the new Tilray's performance and its long-term growth strategies when it reports its next quarterly results. Management expects the merger's operational efficiencies to generate $81 million in annual pre-tax cost-saving synergies within 18 months. If you have faith in the growth of the marijuana industry, Tilray is a smart buy for the long term. Two strong companies with an expanded international presence, strong balance sheet, growing revenues moving closer to profitability, and a good leadership team are all set to become a cannabis powerhouse. That said, do not expect any short-term gains, as a merger integration takes time. So if you can bear the short-term risks to enjoy fruitful gains in the future, this cannabis stock is for you.

Also people have much more saved up after the pandemic and they are getting jobs now and expecting higher wages. Therefore banks are scared of inflation setting in because the dollar is no longer as scarce as it was. And if they start handing out loans then the dollar becomes even less scarce.

{"text": "Valuation: Undervalued $PLTR \u2013 Palantir Technologies Inc Investment Summary: \u00b7 Recently, there has been a lot of excitement around Palantir, however, very few people actually understand what they do and how they operate. As a result of this I have decided to take on the task of trying explain exactly what Palantir does and why they could be the best undervalued stock to buy now. o I am no data engineer, so this article contains my interpretations of what Palantir does, some of my interpretations may be off, so I would appreciate any helpful comments to clear some things up that I may have got wrong. \u00b7 Based on the comparable analyses that I underwent, Palantir is currently an undervalued stock and represents a great opportunity for a long-term hold. o The length of time that I plan on holding is subject to change due to their future financial reports, and any news that may come out. \u00b7 It is very hard to say what the upside potential of an investment into Palantir is, which is why my investment plan (found in the \u201cplan\u201d section) is different than usual. o There are various risks to this investment (like there are to every investment), these risks are highlighted near the end of this report under the \u201crisks\u201d section. o Additionally, there are also multiple different catalysts that can help Palantir\u2019s share price, both in the short and long term(s). These catalysts are listed at the end of this report. Overview of Palantir as a Company: $PLTR - Palantir Technologies Inc. and started building their software primarily for government institutions and intelligence to assist in counterterrorism by any means possible. At this point in time, Palantir\u2019s only source of revenue was through secretive government contracts. However, since that point in time, Palantir has expanded their operations into commercial enterprises, as they noticed a lot of similarities and overlaps with their applications. Now, Palantir\u2019s revenue comes from both Government Contracts and Commercial Enterprise Contracts. Palantir has 2 main software platforms, Palantir \u201cGotham\u201d, and Palantir \u201cFoundry\u201d. Palantir Gotham enables their users to take advantage of all of the data collected by their organization to make informed decisions. Foundry also has a fantastic application for inter-organizational collaboration, this helps a team to build on each others work. Foundry brings all of an enterprises data together onto their platform, however there are access controls in place to define what individuals get control over which dataset(s). From there, Foundry is able to deliver advanced analytics through their machine learning and AI systems to get the most value out of a company\u2019s data, make quality insights, so that their clients can gain a competitive advantage. Foundries potential use cases are almost infinite. Palantir Gotham: Dubbed \u201cThe Operating System for Government Decision Making\u201d, Gotham helps to improve and accelerate decisions across all levels of Government operations. Gotham is primarily used by the defense and intelligence sections of the Government, to help them find what they are looking for. Gotham collects data from millions of different sources and combines it all into one platform to identify hidden patterns and bring all of this data to life. This allows their users to access this data and manage their operations to execute real-world responses to threats that Gotham identifies. Gotham is becoming a main data solution across various different government agencies. There is not too much information that is publicly known about the actual uses of Gotham, which makes sense due to the secretive nature of the organizations that they are in business with. However, what we do know is that these organizations have re-signed contracts with Palantir, which helps us to be confident that this platform is truly \u201cthe real deal\u201d. Lastly, Gotham is also offered to select commercial customers, primarily the companies that are investigating fraud in financial service industries. Furthermore, Palantir has been credited. Gotham helps the Defense and Intelligence sectors of the Government to pool their incomprehensible amounts of data into one place. Palantir uses machine learning to quickly locate hidden pieces of data, and key patterns, so that these institutions can take swift action to the threats/problems they face in real-time. Palantir\u2019s Approach: Palantir believes that every large institution in the world has a problem in their approach to mass data analysis, and Palantir believes that their platforms are best suited to help companies address this problem and make the most out of their data. Palantir recognises that other companies sell features, tools, applications, and/or dashboards, however these products are not built to maintain optimal performance in the long run (if at all). Palantir prides themselves on having the best all around software/platform to have sustainable, reliable, and safe data solutions. Palantir also groups their Foundry data from all of their companies into one large system of several large \u201cfarms\u201d of data provided by each of their client companies. By doing this, Palantir is able to feed more data/information into their machine learning, AI, and algorithms so that they can continue to be more reliable and efficient. This also enables cross-industry data pools BP and Palantir have extended their partnership. National Institute of Health (NIH) and Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS): Palantir has historically been a rather controversial company through their help in government agencies like ICE. However, recently Palantir has been getting good press, which has helped their company image. Since the start of the pandemic some institutions like the NIH and NHS have signed contracts with Palantir, for Palantir\u2019s assistance with their fights against COVID-19, and their vaccine distributions. This is good for Palantir as it shows them in a good light and shows that they can help provide the world with help and safety during a crisis like COVID-19. The NIH agreed to a $36M contract, mission is to build the largest centralized COVID-19 patient database in the world, and Palantir has helped them to do this with massive success. Palantir was able to assist the NIH in building their N3C data platform]( Strengths: Built-in Privacy Controls: By having privacy controls, which makes them 1 of 4 software companies with this level of clearance (alongside Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP). However, it has also been rumoured that Palantir may achieve IL-6 clearance, which has never been done before as it is the storage/processing of classified information. This level of clearance should speak volumes to how safe and secure Palantir\u2019s technology truly is and should provide ease of mind to companies that they are in business with. Expansion into the Commercial Sector: Palantir currently has a huge opportunity ahead of them as they continue to increase their presence in the commercial sector, partnering with some of the largest enterprises in the world. Palantir plans to provide these businesses with the software that they need to do their jobs as efficient as possible and sees large growth potential in this industry. Palantir has said that they are focusing on building partnerships with enterprises that are willing to undergo structural changes within the organization/operations. Palantir has a huge market ahead of themselves in the commercial sector, and their stock should do well on the news breaking of new partnerships between Palantir and commercial enterprises. Government Contracts: Do you remember what I said earlier about what happens once Palantir gets the ball rolling? If so, you will know where I am headed with this section. Between 2008-2018 (10 years), Palantir was able to generate $51.9M in revenue from government contracts. However, in the 2 years following this they earned $179.9M in Government contracts (this can be found under the \u201cUS Government\u201d section of their SEC 10-K report small losses to potentially acquire large contracts with these companies. This phase runs at a loss but helps Palantir set up clients for the next phase. 2. Expand: Once Palantir has a potential customer on the hook, they move them along to the expand phase. Palantir installs their software in these enterprises and teaches them the ropes, of course this requires a large investment from Palantir to incorporate it. These customers often sign a short contract with Palantir for a cheap cost (Palantir takes a loss on this phase as well), however clients are able to truly unlock Palantir\u2019s software during this phase and see what it has to offer. If they like their software, they will be moved along to the next phase (scale) which is Palantir\u2019s bread and butter. 3. Scale: These clients tend to sign longer-term deals with Palantir for their software after they have got a \u201cgood feel\u201d for their software. The companies in this stage are also generally \u201chands-off\u201d meaning that they can operate the software without much help. Companies tend to find the most value in this stage, and Palantir makes the best margins on this stage. In 2020, Palantir made $613.4M in this stage with a margin of 70% Financial information: All of this information can be found in their SEC 10-K filing.: In 2020, Palantir increased their gross profit by 47.97% and increased their gross margin to 81% (from 71%), Palantir reported their first net income (excluding stock-based compensation) ever and increase their net revenues by 47.15%. \u00b7 Financial Performance (Bad): In 2020, Palantir\u2019s loss from operations increased by 103.61%, their stock-based compensation increased by 425.15%, their General and Admin expenses increased by 108.59%, and their net loss increased by 101.22%. Their biggest problem in 2020 was their large stock-based compensation, which will be addressed later. \u00b7 Convertible Preferred Stock: In 2020, Palantir issued a total of 797,771,675 shares of common stock through conversion of their previous \u201cconvertible referred shares\u201d. This one factor of dilution caused an estimated dilutionary effect of Palantir\u2019s stock of 137.19%. This is a huge form of dilution, and I have never seen anything like this before, however I have an explanation for this so stay tuned for that. \u00b7 Repurchase of Common Stock: In 2020, Palantir repurchased 808,201 shares back. This is a measly amount compared to the amount of dilution from preferred stock, however any buyback is good to see as an investor. This buyback caused an inflationary effect on existing shares of 0.14%, which is not much, but we will still take it. \u00b7 Stock Warrants: In 2020, Palantir experienced an additional 7,631,329 shares on the market through the exercising of warrants. The exercising of these warrant had a dilutionary effect on Palantir\u2019s stock of 1.31%. \u00b7 Common Stock (Net of Issuance Costs): In 2020, Palantir unloaded 206,500,523 common shares onto the market from issuance of common stock net of issuance costs. I believe that this means that, Palantir had to fork out additional shares to cover the investment needed to take their shares public. I could very well be wrong on that, and if anyone can pitch in and explain this to me that would be great! Anyways, this caused a dilutionary effect of Palantir\u2019s common stock of roughly 35.51%. This is a large portion of dilution, however it does not even factor in other factors of dilution which is worrying. \u00b7 Stock Options: In 2020, Palantir added 120,617,527 common shares to their shares outstanding through the exercise of options. These options were exercised and thus converted into these common shares and had a dilutionary effect of 20.72%. Once again, this is a large amount of dilution and should be considered by investors. \u00b7 RSU\u2019s: In 2020, Palantir issued 82,429,575 shares through their vesting of \u201cRestricted Stock Units\u201d (RSU\u2019s). This had a dilutionary effect on their stock of 14.18% (which is a lot of dilution). \u00b7 Modification to Stock Options: In 2020, Palantir technically bought back 3,500,0000 shares through modifications to stock options (for the settlement of employee loans accounted for as modifications to stock options). Confusing, right? This technical buyback resulted in a share inflation of 0.6%. \u00b7 Total Share Dilution in 2020:* In 2020, Palantir experience an overall share dilution of 208.19%. This is the most dilution I have ever seen in a stock that I have analyzed, however there are some potential answers as to why there was so much dilution in 2020. Explanation of Share Dilution: Once again, all of the below information can be found in Palantir\u2019s SEC 10-K filing. Additionally, this Direct Listing involved the exercise of al outstanding warrants, which resulted in dilution of 1.31%. Another part of their Direct Listing was the common stocks issued, net of issuance price to complete the direct listing, which had a dilutionary effect of 35.51%. Lastly, Palantir was forced to create new common shares that would hold the place of the unvested RSU\u2019s, which cause a dilutionary effect of 14.18%. Without these factors of dilution, Palantir would have only experienced an overall dilution of 20%. This means that due to the Direct listing, Palantir had to increase their shares outstanding by 188.19% to meet the requirements to be eligible for the listing. Overall Thoughts on Dilution: Palantir is a very weird stock in terms of their dilution, and I have not seen anything quite like this before. Their overall level of dilution is unprecedented and very worrying for investors. However, we know that these levels of dilution were inflated due to the requirements of undergoing a Direct Listing. However, how does Palantir dilution (excluding the effects caused by their Direct Listing compared to their dilution in previous years? For starters, Palantir exhibited a 20% share dilution in 2020 when eluding the dilution caused by the Direct Listing. However, historically Palantir has experienced an average share dilution of 5.18% between 2017-2019. So even excluding the effects caused through the Direct Listing, Palantir still experienced a comparably high level of share dilution. However, 20% of dilution is significantly different than the 208.19% of dilution (which would be crazily high). This 20% is relatively normal for an undervalued growth stock, such as Palantir, so currently I would not be too worried. However, investors should keep up with their financial reports and look for their dilution in 2021, because ultimately that will tell us more about Palantir\u2019s dilution after going public, than their past share dilution as a private company. Competition: In order to undergo my comparable analyses (which will be discussed later on) I needed to select 4 companies, that I can compare to Palantir. $ZS \u2013 Zscaler Inc. $SNOW \u2013 Snowflake Inc is a software and technology company that primarily focuses on data. Snowflake provides data cloud services such as data engineering, data science, data applications, data sharing, and data warehouse. This is very similar to the applications and functions available on Palantir, however Palantir offers other functions that differentiate themselves. Snowflake also provides services for both commercial enterprises and government organizations, similar to that of Palantir. $SPLK \u2013 Splunk Inc, and education institutions. However, the one thing that Tyler has that makes them comparable to Palantir is their data and insight solutions. Their data insights software enables collaboration, displays data visualizations/measurements, and generates insights for their human operators to act on. Q1 2021 Updates: All of the below information can be found in Palantir\u2019s Q1 Investor Presentation with a 44% adjusted FCF margin, they grew revenues by 49% YoY ($341M), and they grew billings by 248% YoY ($362M) which means that Palantir is acquiring new customers and negotiating higher contracts. These financials are great and show a promising future ahead for Palantir, which should excite their investors. Furthermore, during this quarter they also disclosed their investment in a SPAC. This SPAC is $QELL \u2013 Qell Acquisition Corp., in which Palantir will provide the operational platform for their SAFER (Safety Analytics, Forecasting, and Evaluation Reporting) project. This is big news as this is one of Palantir\u2019s bigger contracts, and it shows the level of confidence of the NNSA in Palantir\u2019s software and their cross-enterprise data integration capabilities. On the topic of Palantir and Government Organizations, the DoD used Palantir\u2019s software in all 11 of their Combatant Commands for globally integrated intelligence. This high level of usage from the DoD definitely means that Palantir is doing something right, and if the DoD likes it so much, then it should be more than enough for commercial enterprises. Lastly, in Q1, Palantir won 15 contracts worth over $5M, and 6 contracts worth over $10M with an average duration of 3.7 years (4.6 for commercial customers). This is fantastic for the company as they gained an additional 11 new commercial customers from this, and I will be keeping up to date with these contracts and others as they come up for renewal/negotiations. Additionally, Palantir was able to grow their gross margin to 83% (from 75% Q1 2020), and their contribution margin to 60% (from 41% in Q1 2020). This shows that Palantir business partners are maturing into their 3rd phase, the scale phase, which enables Palantir to grow their margins. $PLTR \u2013 Palantir Investment Valuation: Comparable Analyses: I decided to undergo 2 different comparable analyses in order to get a variety of valuations (or opinions if you will). Preferably, I would like both of these results to be consistent in terms of their fair value estimate, however, if they are not consistent, I will take the average result. I was only able to find 2 multiples/ratios that I could actually analyze due to the nature of these businesses and their lack of positive financial ratios/multiples. EV/Revenue: This is a very common multiple among companies that are not profitable in their operations yet, like Palantir and some of these other comparable companies. By comparing Palantir\u2019s EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors (listed above on the \u201ccompetitors\u201d section of this report), I found that Palantir has a fair value of $32.85/share, which implies an upside to this investment of 23.31%. This implies that given Palantir\u2019s current price, they are undervalued, and the upside is very reasonable, however, I decided to undergo the next comparable to see if this result maintains. P/B: By comparing Palantir\u2019s P/B ratio to that of their competitors, I found that Palantir has a fair value of $24.87/share, which implies that there is a downside risk of 6.64% to such an investment. As you have probably noticed, these results are not consistent, therefore I have decided to take the average result to get one, final price target. Average Comparable: By taking the average result from the 2 comparable analyses underwent, I found that Palantir has a fair value of $28.86/share, which implies an overall upside of 8.36% to this investment. This also implies that Palantir, is in fact an undervalued growth stock, that has the potential to be one of the best undervalued stocks on the market. My Plan for Investing into Palantir: My plan for this investment is a little different from usual. I see anything between $24.87/share (Fair Value of P/B ratio) and $28.86/share (average comparable) as a good chance to buy Palantir at (or below) its fair value. This helps to limit our downside risk of this investment. However, I think the best way to play an investment in Palantir is over the long-run 3+ years. I would attempt to buy in at the above prices and hold for these 3+ years. During this time, I would re-evaluate my investment with every new financial report and piece of news to decide if it is still worth holding. Potential Risks to Palantir\u2019s Stock - $PLTR: \u00b7 Dilution: Over the past year Palantir has experienced a lot of dilution, however, we have already attributed a great deal of this dilution to their Direct Listing. However, the 20% of dilution that was not derived from the direct listing is still quite high. As investors, we should keep an eye on their future levels of dilution to recognize any patterns/increases that we should be weary of. If these levels of dilution persist, potential investors may be scares off and current investor might sell their positions, which will hurt the share price. \u00b7 Financial Performance: This year\u2019s financial performance was not one to be overly happy about. Although they were able to increase some pretty important aspects of their balance sheet, Palantir was still yet to make a profit, and increased their net losses by over 100%. If this poor financial performance continues, and they keep digging themselves into a bigger and bigger hole, investors will run away from this stock and never look back. However, the Q1 financial performance gives investors hope for a more profitable future, which will be discussed later. \u00b7 Bad Press: Historically, Palantir has not been looked at through a positive lens by many people investors and non-investors alike. Their first public backlash came through their involvement in deporting immigrants through Palantir\u2019s partnership with ICE over 4,300,000 of their common shares. This is good to see as an investor, especially this early in the company (and not too long after their Direct Listing). This gives me hope that Palantir will continue to repurchase more shares in the future. This will be good for the share price as it will increase the value of existing shares, and it will be especially good for the stock price if they continue to buyback more shares each year. \u00b7 Financial Performance: Palantir\u2019s 2020 financial report was not favourable (as discussed previously), however there were definitely some good to take out of it. Palantir increased their revenue, gross profit, and margins by a hefty amount, which is good to see as an investor, however, there was bad aspects of this report as well that made the report unfavourable. However, their newly released Q1 2021 financial report has so much more to offer in terms of good aspects of a financial report. \u00b7 Positive Press: As previously mentioned, Palantir has had their fair share of bad press that has had a small effect on their share price. However, recently Palantir has been getting better press through helping organizations like the NIH and NHS in their fight against COVID-19, and their vaccine distribution efforts. Partnerships like this help to display the positive impacts that can be derived from Palantir\u2019s technology. Future events where Palantir can use their software for a good cause can help to combat the negative stigma around Palantir and attract more people to invest in their company. This should help their share price in the short term after these articles are released. \u00b7 Success Stories: Since Palantir have gone public, they have had a few success stories come out, I mentioned some of these stories throughout the article. These success stories show how impactful Palantir\u2019s software can be and can show companies that they can increase revenues, production etc. just by using Palantir\u2019s software. Any future stories like this that come out, highlighting the benefits of Palantir can help the stock soar, and potential clients to reach out and start business/inquiries with Palantir. \u00b7 Renewing Contracts: I have mentioned that the renewal of contracts can help Palantir\u2019s share price a couple times throughout this article but why is this the case? This is because these companies that are renewing have already been through Palantir\u2019s 3 stage business model and have experienced their software firsthand for numerous years. After their time with Palantir\u2019s software expires they decide to renew the contract. This is good because it shows that Palantir\u2019s software was effective enough to their business in the time they had it that it is worth these $5-15M+ contract renewals. Furthermore, these companies that are renewing already have underwent Palantir\u2019s installation, and these clients will provide Palantir with the highest margins, which will reflect well on Palantir\u2019s future financial reports. \u00b7 New Partnerships/Contracts (and the expansion of commercial enterprise segment): Every time that Palantir, or its partners release news that they have entered into a contract/agreement, this will help Palantir\u2019s stock. This is because Palantir needs to keep expanding their software into new companies in order to meet their expected growth projections. Furthermore, as more commercial enterprises try Palantir\u2019s software (and hopefully enjoy it), the more willing other companies might be to give Palantir a shot. I see their biggest potential for growth and to become a large company in their expansion of their commercial enterprise segment through Foundry. Every time Palantir gets more new clients on board it is fantastic and shows the feasibility of this segment, and as more contracts role in, more enterprises will take an interest. Furthermore, when Palantir signs these enterprises to a contract, it will help to increase their revenues, which will show up on their financial reports and hopefully help the, to beat estimates.

{"text": "Payoneer is a payment platform that offers a way for businesses to pay and receive money, for a low fee. Payoneer believes that the total addressable market (defined as global e-commerce volume) is $26 trillion a year. Payoneer processed over $44 billion in 2020 alone. Payoneer works with 9 of the top 20 most valuable companies. Alongside these big names, Payoneer also has 5 million+ marketplaces and businesses, across over 190 countries. Payoneer also offers: Accounting integrations Capital to small businesses Regulatory and compliance infrastructure Physical debit cards Tax solutions So, it is basically a bank that includes an accountant to help meet a business\u2019 needs. The one product or feature that is missing is digital coins and no doubt they will be offering that soon, if anything they should make that a major priority. Management Team Scott Galit - CEO of Payoneer, previously a senior VP at MasterCard. Serious financial services pedigree. Michael G Levine - CFO of Payoneer, ex-City VP and ex-CFO of Maler Technologies. MBA from Wharton. Betsy Cohen - Tons of finance related experience, including founding Bancorp. Should be able to give Payoneer great advice for future growth. Customers Payoneer has some big name clients, including but not limited to: Amazon Europe Google eBay Walmart Upwork Fiverr AirBnB Booking.com Weird right, they work with Ebay given Paypal does too. This is because they work with countries and specific clients that Paypal not accept into their platform. Investors need to understand that sometimes people have to use other platforms because they the Paypal\u2019s or banks are NOT willing to take the risk. Sure the risk is probably higher but the amount of people that need access to capital or payment process is high when many banks in many countries do not approve people for such type of access. Switching Costs Integrating, setting up, and teaching staff how to use a new payment platform can be time-consuming and expensive for businesses. Therefore, when a client is set up on Payoneer, it is unlikely that they will switch to another provider. This is best seen by the >100% volume retention that Payoneer has (i.e. customers stay and increase their payment volume). Brand Payoneer, from what I have seen, has a strong brand (though this is obviously a subjective factor). This idea is reinforced by the presence of their big name clients. Branding is really important in FinTech, businesses need 100% confidence when money and payments are involved. This offers not only stops entrants into their market, but should also facilitate future growth and customer acquisition. Network Effect Imagine company A is on Payoneer and wants to pay company B. Company A suggests payment through their usual payment processor, Payoneer. Company B now signs up to Payoneer and decides to do all their payments through it etc. This is the network effect that Payoneer enjoys. This is a very powerful barrier to entry - very difficult to overcome, while also hard to create yourself. Geographies UNSUBSTANTIATED: Conversations on Reddit leads me to believe that Payoneer has a strong presence in Asia. If anyone has evidence, please put it in the comments. If this is true, it should give Payoneer an edge in capitalising on the future growth of the emerging markets. Some evidence: The CEO has gone on record saying Korea is one of their big market focuses. * Achieved triple digit growth each year in the asian markets from 2012-2016. # Valuation and Financials # Enterprise Value: $3.29 billion # Projected 2021 revenue: $432 million # EV/2021 revenue multiple: 7.6x # 2019-2020 revenue growth: 8.8% Institutional Ownership Payoneer has some institutional giants already invested, including Wellington Management, Dragoneer Investment Group, Fidelity Management and Research, Temasek, and Franklin Templeton. What do I think the future holds for Payoneer? I actually think there are several exits for this company. 1. Growth: The company continues to grow and eventually reach billions of revenue 2. Consolidation: Large international payments processer buys them. Could be Paypal, Square, Stripe, First Data, etc. consolidation WILL happen in this space and I think short-term Payoneer will acquire some companies and then be sold to a bigger company. Think of this as how banks in the USA were allowed to merge in 1995 given the law that passed. Before you had 100,000 banks then it was 50,000 banks, then 10,000 banks, and now like 5,000 banks but the top 10 banks make up a large % of the business/volume. 3. Wildcard: CRM business buys them. What many people do not realize is that CRM\u2019s have been changing the game. First, it was to help you sell with marketing tools, then it is to improve communication within the team, then it will be stored, and legal transactions then it will be a financial transaction. They are literally going to control the beginning to the end of the customer relationship and all of that data they possess is very valuable to help their customers grow.

To begin with, Corsair is part of the gaming industry which is set to at least double in size by 2030 ! Corsair has one of the biggest market shares of gaming peripherals and they have consistently sustained the high competition of this industry. 2. Corsair innovates year after year by releasing new products that are immediately loved by consumers. Their latest headset is a great example of this. They managed to merge a gaming headset with a casual and easy to use design making it the perfect headset for gamers on the regular basis. 3. Corsair has solid financials. Their P/E ratio is only 20 ! THAT IS RIDICULOUSLY LOW. especially considering their very high growth rate. 4. Their balance sheet is great and their debt is rather low compared to their cash meaning they won\u2019t go bankrupt anytime soon and can use cash to fuel their future growth.

We\u2019re going to make some money, they\u2019ll keep hodling their dicks underneath the teetering lid of the cookie jar. Disclaimer: Join me in this play, or don\u2019t, I do not care. This is the part where I tell you that I\u2019m not responsible for the decisions that you make with your life. AerCap Holdings, Inc. is an aircraft leasing company based out of Dublin. They don\u2019t make planes, they don\u2019t fly planes. They just own planes, and they lease the shit out of them out to airlines around the globe. They do this a lot, and in fact they\u2019re the largest jet leasing company in the world, both in terms of units and revenues. And within the next 30 days they\u2019re about to get a whole lot fucking bigger. I'm putting this here so that my thumbnail image isn't a table.: Furthermore, CEO Angus Kelly, has repeatedly gone on record stating that confidence is strong that the global air travel industry will return to normal, as communicated to him by his customers, and as evidenced by the collection of lease payments. As for how that affects AerCap stock, air travel recovery to pre-pandemic levels has already been priced in. AerCap Holdings \u2013 what is it? This is an extremely well-managed, boring-ass business. As I mentioned, this is the largest commercial jet leasing company in the world. They buy airplanes using debt, then they lease those airplanes to airlines and collect monthly lease payments. Think of them like a REIT, but in the sky. Their list of clients is really fucking long, including roughly 200 airlines in 80 different countries. Name an airline; it is most likely a customer. The deal is worth approximately $30 Billion. # The EU Antitrust regulators are to make their decision on this merger by July 26th. US DOJ has already approved the deal. This is our catalyst. I may have forgotten to put this information in the original post and it's kind of important so I'm sneaking it in with an edit. That $30 Billion is buying a lot of fucking aircraft. This article from 2018 and has a client list consisting of 200+ customers in 70 countries. So this deal makes AerCap the lessor to just about every damn airline on the planet. It is the world's biggest buyer of aircraft from Boeing and Airbus. It is partnering with GE, which builds 70% of the world's narrow-body aircraft engines. It also expands AerCap's business into a brand new operational territory. Aside from being a commercial aircraft giant, GECAS owns an entity called Milestone, which is currently the world\u2019s largest helicopter leasing company. According to the website. You can play this with shares obviously, and you might see the open interest on the calls and decide that\u2019s a better plan. I have a few shares but those have been a long term hold for me. As for me, I\u2019m playing this with calls. As of right now, this is my position: I am going to keep adding as long as the price stays down. I just started buying yesterday, and added more today. I think that this $52 level is the floor, and I will keep adding as long as the price stays down below $55.

{"text": "This post is to consider buys and options in CLF. There is VERY large near term risk and reward. CLF is a US steel manufacturing company, one of the worlds largest, and environmentally cleanest. Says they: \"Cleveland-Cliffs is the largest flat-rolled steel company and the largest iron ore pellet producer in North America. The company is vertically integrated from mining through iron making, steelmaking, rolling, finishing and downstream with hot and cold stamping of steel parts and components. \" It is not new to WSB, usually\\~ top 25 tickers mentioned prior 10y. Now there is a monstrous \"Infrastructure\" bill being considered (bridges, roads, rail) for \\~1 T USD Will it pass? We will see. That is the play here. It is a straight fundamentals/value play, with a transformative binary event coming. TBD consider- on the plus side, all the steel needed to correct crumbling bridges, falling condo towers, the rebar for concrete, and the new Amtrak rail proposition...most all of this will come from steel made by CLF. It is a domestic pay to play contracting deal. CLF knows this. They have aquired Arcelor Mittal and AK steel to become THE player that will directly benefit from the passage of the bill. There are financial minuses. To doot: PLUSES: YUGE Infrastructure Contrax Potentate Transformer events imminent 110MM in cash Profitable with 4 BB in revenue per Q (!!) 10x positive momentum, from the 2020 trough 2/3 of ownership is institutional / bullish hedges (Lazard, Wellington, Victory, Berkshire/Buffet, Viking et al) Short float >10% Cramer likes it \u200b MINUSES: Massive Insider purchase/sell churn of 40 MM shares / 12 mos. Why? Debt=Assets = 6BB \"Other Liabilities\" = 6BB (WTF are those??) Short float >10% Cramer likes it \u200b OVERALL The next week will determine if the Senate will pass this infrastructure thing. It is NOT CLEAR if the 1716 bipartisan earmarks funds for politicians home districts (\"pork barrel profit\") will be enough to guarantee votes to pass this overstuffed pig through the Senate. This is the sub-Trillion dollar Jabba the Hutt of bills, being shoved through the door before another election, while its still possible. Negotiation is happening. A few R votes were in swing districts. However, only a few moderate/conservative seantors are needed now. It is also not clear overall if politics will interfere (despite everyone wanting to fund infrastructure), because D are demanding a concomitant social reparation and reconciliation bill, and holding this one hostage, to get equality repaired. This game of chicken will end, one way or another. Ind/Green are on board, for what minor impacts that it matters to. Usually, veterans, energy, environment, and infrastructure are political sacred cows that dont go begging, and the parties can get past theirselves to fund something. Right now the Inf bill and the D hold a 2% advantage, and that is all that's needed. The benefit is to the home CLF steel plants in MI and MN are accompanied by powerful senators Klobuchar and Stabenow. It's big, it's ugly, it's lobbied sausage. We proceed, woke to that. I assert nothing here of disparaging nature, the company is solid and, Can Do. Obviously the CEO Goncalves has repositioned the company with aquisitions and debt leverage to take advantage of the possibility of a monster legislative win for this profitable domestic steel company. There is a gigantic balance sheet with big sleeping line items that only a professional forensic accountant could detail accurately in order to assess true risk (not myself, I just Like the Stonk). But Goncalves thinks that this Godzilla of spending will pass, and that negotiations this week will make it run. Normally mining and basic materials are boring. NOT this week. Is it all \"priced in\" already ? No. Personally I think the 113 missing people from the Miamo condo, the worsening climate, buckling NW roads, and the possibilty to rebuild Amtrak, but using massive amounts of CLF steel to build new rail etc. will make this a triple bag over the next Q, even w/o Options. Revenue is up for 4 Q straight. There is overall gross political alignment and momentum. Only the trigger remains. We are building, we are emerging from pandemic isolation to find buckled roads, falling structures, and no war to suck up commodities. This is the spend, this is the company. If you dont like it, you can go pound sand with Vulcan Materials $VMC and do a concrete play, or pump copper with the $COPX ETF. I dont own those. Disclaimer: I have 100 CLF shares, considering more if I can dump some volatile biotech. This short analysis is my own. Do your DD, find out for yourselves, you beautiful retards, I love you. Maybe CLF will too. Best of luck \u200b EDIT 1: While the numbers for CLF are all available for DD, the political needs work here; getting DMs. Did not mean to imply the vote was today. Therefore the timeline is updated to Jul 31, TBD before the August recess. I could not find a shceduled vote for a finished product. A call for a House vote was made today by a particular caucus. Tester (MT) believes there are 11-17 R that will vote for it. Legislation is being written frenetically right now. Differences of position between Biden, Pelosi, Shumer, McConnell, and Manchin are apparently nearly addressed. Apparently the goal is to craft a bill that can pass, work it out before hand, and the riders and reconciliation will get included or not depending on who they can get. Last there was a 700B water infrastructure bill not to be confused with this one, and the current infrastructure bill range reputedly is much larger, 1.2T even by some estimates. Thanks Edit 2 : Important commentary on the market and timeline is digested here. Several have noted the presence of competitors Nucor, CMC, SDI, Gerdau in the rebar market. These makers have raised their steel prices by 40-50/st recently. Yet steel futures are astronomically high right now and are not going down. It was pointed out that 70% of the steel market is scrap. However, China is reputedly out of scrap steel now. It was further pointed out the the original Cleveland Cliffs makes iron pellet as basic fabrication stock, not completed steel product. Now the recent grab of Arcelor Mittal cold roll sheet and other products is what makes the new CLF \"vertically integrated\". The post stands. If anything these comments underscore the importance of CLF balance sheet being positive and growing. The slow speed of the congressional action getting to actual CLF books is appreciated. Thanks Edit 3: Re: Cramer. The visceral, rapid response to even mentioning the guys name has honestly taken me aback. He really evokes something primal in this community. That deserves some reflection and thought. Only one day in, I awoke this morning to another dozen messages about it. As soon as the name was mentioned in the post, a knee jerk reaction apparently went off. Many stopped reading and started writing. Several missed that he was also listed as a negative, so it has to be inferred they didnt get to the overall content summary. Admittedly that following content was a wall of text, but others appreciated it and awarded. Apologies if the attempt at humor botched. Thanks. For this post I will neither defend nor attack the guy libelously (if thats a word). There is some useful content to his analysis; but there's also great suspicion and even hatred in this community. It's broader than just $CLF. So, I hear and appreciate that. However someone else will have to fully characterize and comment on it. I dont get it fully, obviously. Theres history there. Hopefully we Apes can all keep our heads on. Apologies for my stepping on an apparent landmine. Point noted.

{"text": "Edit 1:The title has Netflix twice as opposed to AT&T which I meant to include. Edit 2: The main suggestion is wait until Netflix's earning report, they report first. Then see if they lost domestically and guess who relatively gained the most subscribers of the remaining streamers (using google trends). Edit 3: Internationally Netflix is present in more countries, than Disney, and last HBO (due to licensing deals). The domestic growth should be the relative most different between them i.e. one may have stagnated or decreased while other gained. They probably all grew internationally and it is too hard for me to tell which one grew the most. I made guesses below. Edit 4. Slight risk that people wait until both earnings have posted before making a bullish decision,if AT&T's financial statements indicate that. AT&T earnings = July 22nd. Discovery earnings = August 4th (estimated). Edit 5. Woah games for Netflix. Doesn't change information below, estimating subscriber growth. AT&T is already decent with games. Disney has lots of games IP that it sells out. Time will tell. \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Not a financial advisor JakeAlphaInvestingCorp. \\-Blessed be my followers Disclaimer: My position: Extremely Red on $T Calls. Data pulled from a variety of sources, may be inaccurate. Especially google trends. I am biased, thus more of AT&T is presented. TLDR: Netflix fell last earnings report due to weak subscriber growth, the price has since risen. Google trends indicates a repeat of low subscribers for the quarter. Disney fell last earnings report due to weak subscriber growth and parks being shut for the pandemic. Disney+ seems to have had an alright quarter for subscribers, it really started taking off in July so that's good. This is after Q2 earnings so it will not greatly affect financials yet. AT&T price rose last earnings on strong subscriber growth in both businesses, but then fell on merger announcement with Discovery. Google trends indicates their greatest subscriber growth for HBO to date. Feeling a repeat. VIACOM this DD has less on them but seeing competitors is good. Great past earnings. Discovery, your now stuck on the HBO train. Netflix's success or failure domestically and internationally will be reported on July 20th. This may help assess AT&T, Disney, Viacom, and Discovery investments. It would be smart to wait till after Netflix earnings before making a decision. Previous posts by the author about streaming: (Check my profile) 1. Google Trends review posted a month ago. More current info presented below. 2. Options Play for Q1 2021 ER, Disney vs Netflix vs AT&T. Big success. 3. AT&T call before prior earnings. Big success then a big fail on merger. \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Past Quarter Price Action: Below, in order, are the 3 month graphs for Netflix, AT&T, and Disney. Netflix down, AT&T up, and Disney down on earnings. The red line represents the earnings report. As stated above subscriber growth for the three companies influenced the bullish or bearish behavior. Google trends was fairly reliable last quarter in predicting this. No guarantees as to the current quarter. The blue line for AT&T represents the merger announcement with Discovery. Order of earnings for current quarter is Netflix, AT&T, Discovery (est.), Viacom, Disney. I am currently holding T calls (mainly), VIAC calls, and Discovery shares. \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE BOX OFFICE 2021 Having Box Office hits has been one of the major drivers of subscriptions to a streamers platform in the past year. Many of these hits do well internationally in countries such as China. \\- The list below shows the top grossing movies of 2021 domestically. A movie such as Wonder Woman 1984 released in 2020 will be shown on this list as it earned revenue in 2020. \u200b Below I have totaled the revenues from the top 25 Movies from the list above both domestically/internationally by studio. Only those released since 2021, so not including Wonder Woman and some other titles. [Data from Numbers.com. As such there was no way for them to compete internationally. Search criteria = \"Television Network\" Disney while having a week start of the quarter has since up-trended for it's Marvel releases. HBO began a strong quarter on the release of GvsK. This is mainly due to the United States. HBO has a final uptick seen here but not seen in the United States graph. This is due to HBO's international launch in 39 countries and territories in Latin America which seems to have edged them extremely close to Disney on an international scale. HBOs final uptick could strongly be influenced by a big marketing push in Latin America. Note:HBO will call there platform different things in different countries. For marketing reasons and due to deals with regional providers. In Canada HBO is called \"Crave\" and distributed by Bell. It will not show up on the search results. It can also be called HBO Latin America or HBO Asia depending on your region. This last point google may be smart enough to interpret for google trends, I am unsure. Disney is just Disney+. \u200b Search criteria = \"Search Term\" Worldwide Netflix is still on a downtrend over the past quarter, seemingly following last quarters trends. (Once again google trends data may be inaccurate). Still the leader by a lot and a bit of an uptick at the end. Disney has been higher this past quarter than the same time last year. Worldwide it has still not had the same interest as during the 2020 holiday season but it has been steady all quarter and then up-trending strongly since July. HBO worldwide continues to uptrend more strongly than it's previous high during the holiday season where they added the most subscribers to date. International users will not greatly affect Q2 financials apart from maybe adding subscribers in the final 3 days of the quarter. \u200b HBO vs Paramount vs Discovery Worldwide, \"Search Term\" Search Term used and Discovery is an actual word, might be other reasons to type this in. Paramount just launched/ changed it's name this quarter. Discovery seems to have more appeal than paramount but it is on a steady downtrend over the quarter. United States More of the same. \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ HBO Goes International Regional Breakdown of Interest Worldwide: 12 Months Disney is winning HBO only overtook Disney this past quarter in the United States.

{"text": "Why hello again apes, Remember me? Just one of your many friendly neighborhood PSFE bag holders who believes he\u2019s cracked the code well enough to convince his wife\u2019s bf to let him sleep in the house again soon. The key to that code? Richard \u201cDa\u2019 mill.\u201d Wyckoff. I just wanted to give an update, so I won\u2019t bore you with the same rambling explanation of the schematic and how it works, but I will explain why you should be looking hard in the coming days\u2014heh, looking hard. You can find it in my previous post here: 2007 @ $15.21, yep. The long short of it: For 8 long weeks now, hedgies have been buying up every last seat on the Paysafe rocket right before your eyes. Guess what? Where you saw a pump and dump (emphasis on dump), what you were actually seeing was \u2018tutes securing their pet goldfish a second private villa in Bora Bora paid for in full by paper handed apes who didn\u2019t realize they were moon bound. The good news: we already have the Empire\u2019s secret plan, the one that they\u2019ve been using successfully for 100 years now, and Paysafe is playing it out in textbook fashion. Oh, you want some proof? Exhibit A: As of Today, institutional holdings of PSFE totaled 58.11% of the OS (723,734,536) BEFORE most of the Q2 filings have even been reported. In other words, we already know they can\u2019t get enough of the stuff. Per Fintel now account for a coincidental 50.159% controlling stake of the max OS should all warrants be exercised. I go through this in great detail here. Per SEC Filings have my dignity so far. (FWIW, the rest of the PIPE remains locked for another couple months). Disclaimer: there is some debate as to whether the \u201c60 days thereafter\u201d clause refers to calendar days or trading days. My read, and the read of the attorney I asked (yep, PSFE is all I\u2019ve got these days :/ ) was that, having explicitly used \u201ctrading days\u201d in the first clause and not in the second implies calendar days. Make your own call. Regardless, the point still stands. Now, on to the Wyckoff: Last week, following that oddly timed WSB pump (more on that in a minute), I made a post here about the way Paysafe\u2019s price action has followed an age old accumulation schematic designed to allow \u2018tutes to inconspicuously buy up every seat on the rocket ship they can while the rest of us are trying to figure out how to tell our wife\u2019s bf that we spent our allowance money on tickets aboard the Titanic. Again, this is just an update on where we stand, so I won\u2019t break down every phase again, but I will show our chart compared to the schematic and let you decide for yourself. I\u2019ll also dig more into where I believe we are in the chart. When last we spoke, we were coming out of an interesting turn of events as suddenly Paysafe was trending on WSB out of nowhere\u2014many of the posts coming from new accounts. Even I, a lowly bag holder, thought this was pretty suspicious. For one, Russell was reconstituting with PSFE making the 1000 with a 12m share purchase. For two, as I interpreted the lockup clause, we were pumping right into the weekend where those PIPE shares were to be unlocked. Then what happened: We had a glorious 10% day on enormous relative volume that broke out of the top of the Wyckoff channel only to be smited back down by shorts. Didn\u2019t seem like enough of a pump to lead me to believe PIPE was looking to sell. At that time, I was curious as to whether that move was the beginning of our \u201csign of strength\u201d within the structure, but had said that it felt a little premature within the channel. Instead, we came back down to the $12 range where guess what? \u2018tutes kept right on loading. This time way higher in the accumulation channel than where they\u2019d been loading previously (in the $11.2 range)\u2014likely in large part thanks to paper hands and lingering demand below. Why the pump? Well, here\u2019s where the Wyckoff Psychology comes into play. The purpose of an accumulation channel is, again, for \u2018tutes to inconspicuously drain the channel of all liquidity, so that when the time comes for them to mark up the equity, they can trust the solidity of this floor\u2014and make a king\u2019s ransom of tendies in the process. How do they do it? By breaking your spirit and slowly eroding your self proclaimed diamond hands to find the paper underneath. They\u2019ll let her run, sure. False breakouts will appear. FOMO creeps in. OG holders feel their bags get a little lighter, then wham! another shakeout. They\u2019re starving for paper hands (liquidity). In other words, they want supply, and they want it in a way that isn\u2019t going to reveal their master plan. Further, what better way to inconspicuously buy up a massive number of shares without drawing attention than to blame it on a bunch of apes while running media stories about how it was an orchestrated squeeze attempt? 57m shares traded immediately following a pump out of nowhere with countless WSBers saying \u201cThis feels fishy\u201d \u201cPump and Dump\u201d \u201cClearly an orchestrated distraction.\u201d Interesting. Guess what? I now believe you were right, but that wasn\u2019t the trap. The trap is what\u2019s happening right now. It\u2019s the part of the schematic where they\u2019re hoping all of these new bag holders have paper hands and sell them their newly acquired rocket ship seats dirt cheap as they push her down, for what I believe is the final time. This is Phase C. This is the test. Now they even want you to think it was a pump and dump, so you'll panic and cut your losses at their gain. Further, there could have been some testing of the effectiveness of a markup strategy when the time comes where they need upwards volatility in the channel. Phase C: Now, the \u2018tutes have spent 8 weeks accumulating shares in this channel. They\u2019ve done so with great success and have not been unloading them on the descents (that\u2019s where watching the volume is important). Instead, they sped up the process drastically by hiding behind you guys, and clearing it out on the way up. They didn\u2019t have to do that. They were in full control of this for months (trust me, I\u2019ve watched it every last day)\u2014unless they were running out of liquidity. If this is the case, we have indeed reached Phase C of the Wyckoff\u2014the final shakeout. Suddenly, as if on cue, Paysafe, has spent the last few days following the exact same trajectory. Instant sucker punch down at open by shorts to the next line of support, followed by barcoding on decreasing volume\u2014that latter part being very important. Translation: They are now testing supply at various supports within the channel on low volume\u2014indicating low liquidity. Diamond hands are holding up. This is the purpose of Phase C. Further, they aren\u2019t unloading. All those shares they bought on high relative volume at $12 the days before? Those shares are in the red too, and we aren\u2019t seeing them being unloaded? Hmm, interesting. That being said, will your hands still be diamonds if they, say, push it down to the next line of support around 11.08, or will you be giving up your seat on the rocket at the bottom of an accumulation channel to \u2018tutes that aren\u2019t selling? The suits themselves spent last week(s) loading up at $11.20. ($11.28 being the point of control). What if they push it down even further into what looks like a structure break? Will you have a stop loss set so that they can steal your shares from you while you\u2019re sitting on the launchpad? That\u2019s what they want. That\u2019s what Wyckoff called \u201cthe spring\u201d\u2014which like stonks, go up. Will they find more supply at the base of the channel from paper hands the world over and decide to keep right on loading the boat in a B phase, or will they find that this rocket is full of certified diamond handed apes who will hodl until they\u2019ve broken the surly bonds of Earth and touched the face of Planet Tendie!? Game recognizes game here. Ultimately, the choice is yours. What follows Phase C? Phase D and markup. This is the point where institutions have loaded all that they can hold and have established this accumulation channel as properly drained and solidified. You'll also know this when you see it. Suddenly Demand comes in hard and up we go. Why? Well, because now that very same big money that has been holding us down becomes our tailwind looking to see how high they can get us before either re-accumulating or selling it back to retail at a fat markup. Those 34.7m shares shorted according to S3--most of which likely merely opened to manipulate us within this channel? They'll know when it's time to close and so will you. What to watch for: Volume is number one here. I want to see low or decreasing volume on down moves. Again, that implies low liquidity and indicates that big money is not unloading shares. I want to see high or increasing volume on moves up. This indicates demand and its strength within the channel. Further, whereas a spring is not a necessity, the idea that we continue to move down and test 11.28, 11.08, and/or possibly even further in a spring scenario is not unlikely whatsoever, if not probable. Fwiw, notice the open interest on $11 puts as well. There could be big money looking to make money on this phase down as well. All in all, I want to see low liquidity at these supports; otherwise we run the risk of institutions moving back into a B accumulation phase. Then, I want to see demand take the reins, shorts to begin closing, and markup to begin. TL;DR: Believe it or not, even as a bag holder, I\u2019m not posting this to beg you to buy here. In fact, if anything, I\u2019m telling you wait and watch closely to what it does from here--but this is not investment advice. Buy if you want, but more importantly, watch for the point in this structure where they\u2019re looking to shred every paper hand and don\u2019t be one of them. Just hodl dammit. You\u2019ll know it when you see it. Not every Wyckoff has to have a spring. Maybe she jumps from here and then be looking for support tests (sign of strength), especially above that 12.64 level on good volume. If not though, watch for the reactions below 11.28, 11.08, 10.23 (in the worst case) etc, and see it for what it is: Whales opening their mouths to suck in every last paper hand they can find. Instead, look them straight in the eye, and offer up the diamond studded appendage of your choosing\u2014and LOAD AT THE SPRING/MARKUP (if you want). Why? because this rocket is bound for the moon. It\u2019s only a matter of how many seats you want the \u2018tutes to have on that journey. PS) Do your own DD, make your own decisions. I'm an idiot, but again, I'm clearly not just doing this as a pump by any means. I just like the idea of apes eating tendies, and my read on it is that there's a strong possibility to do so incoming on PSFE. EDIT: For some reason half of my post suddenly disappeared. Adding it back with the images and refixing typos and other edits real quick EDIT 2: Re-uploaded the PSFE chart when I noticed I was missing the upper resistance of the supply zone ($12.64). I cleaned up the labelling of the AR, and I also left the OBV indicator on the chart after u/HoneyMilkMan commented correctly about it being another clear indicator of accumulation. As I said in my reply to that comment, the overall downward slope of the OBV further implies (to me) that the liquidity within the channel is dwindling overall.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-07-04 08:48:17", "id": "od73un"}

{"text": "Background Information: Alight is a benefits service provider that covers a spectrum of services in the space both in the U.S. and worldwide. It does 1) Health administration, 2) Healthcare Navigation, 3) Medicare Enrollment (For retiring people without pensions) 4) Wealth Administration, 5) Cloud Payroll, 6) Global Payroll, and 7) HCM Cloud Advisory and Deployment. In short it covers the full spectrum of the benefits service package, which no one has ever done before (even though it seems like a no brainer, which means it's competing in a fragmented space, offers better integration, has cross-selling opportunity, and can save their clients time while increasing gross and net profit margins). Don't believe me? Take a look at page 11 here: Welcome to a new way forward (q4cdn.com), while the rest is project based, and the CEO is trying to increase subscription revenues. They also expect 50% BPAAS revenue by 2023, which give higher margins, and the bundled health benefit BPAAS offers 50% more annual recurring revenue benefits. They also have strong FCF and net leverage at a 3x ratio, which means they can pursue M&A safely to grow, and it's helpful that there are a large, fragmented and global pool of acquisition targets. With Bill Foley's experience, they'll be able to hone in on the best acquisition targets, since he will become the chairman. These services can be integrated, and cross-sold, which Alight has already done with its current acquisitions as well. They are looking to get 60%+ gross margin long term, and 40%+ by FYE 2023. Adjusted EBITDA Margin should be 24% in 2023. Expected BPAAS Revenues (NOT TOTAL BOOKINGS) are 363M 2021E, 509M 202E, and 743M by 2023E. You can see their expectation for how much of that BPAAS revenue will comprise in the deck, but to sum it up it's 13, 17, 23%. In addition to margins, BPAAS will accelerate implementation and revenue recognition from the current 12-18 months to 6-9 months. Total Revenue in 2021 is expected to be 2.76B in 2021, 2.945B in 2022, and 3.235B in 2023. Free Cash Flow for 2021 is expected to be 465M, 493M in 2022, and 607M in 2023. Which means they can easily service the 300M bond in 2025, and the 1.976B Term Loan in 2026. I know they referenced potentially getting the terms changed so they pay a lower interest rate, but I'm not sure if they will. Regardless after the merger, they received 360M to the balance sheet. The best part of all this is that they are expected to have net income (excluding tax affected shareholder based compensation at a tax rate of 26% in 2021-2023E) of 9M at the end of 2021. This includes a one time 76M charge to extinguish their debt post merger, and one time restructuring costs regarding the merger which impact 2021 earnings for 44M. It also includes IT Optimus Investments which will run through 2021 and 2022 and can be found on page 20 of the slide deck. Finally intangible amortization is 201M, and Depreciation is 112M. They expect Net income of 221M at the end of 2023. Conclusion: There are a few AMAZING gems in the shit pile that is SPACS. This one is my favorite, and I expect a 200% return in 2-3 years, because of the stickiness of the model and the cross-sell opportunities that this company has as a full service provider (the only one) for employee benefits and retirement. I was thinking of doing another one in a week for another SPAC company that is merging that are good, but I need to acquire a strong enough stake in them first. For Alight, I bought 2 7.5 Calls at an average of 2.43 for Feb 2022 which are nearly in the money. I had hoped to buy more, but with nearly 10K tied in options on both Cannae and CCS I felt constricted by risk management, and so that's what I put in. I also have 523 shares in the company. I had talked in the yacht club about this company for a few days now, and there was a point (before today, and yesterday) where you could have bought the 7.5 calls for Feb and had a breakeven below 9.90-9.95, which is ridiculous considering the NAV price was 10.70, and most SPACS are priced at 10. This is the type of company with the moat, growth, and operating margins (That are expanding) that I want. The CEO is a rockstar if you look him up. There's a strong board, and mergers and acquisitions have consistently been good. Strong FCF, quarterly execution that is coming out the gate strong with a slight beat already, and a clear path to GAAP profitability on a net income basis.

Corsair's share price has recently been beaten down for the following two reasons. Eagletree owns the majority of the shares and has been selling off anytime the price nears or goes above $35. This is a short-term problem and creates a great opportunity to sell covered calls and load up for the moonshot that will occur as soon as Eagletree is done selling. The other reason this stock price has been pushed down is because of shills like Cramer saying that Corsair is a covid play and that gaming sales will slow down once everything reopens. This is bullshit. Corsair is projecting even more revenue in 2021 than 2020 and the gaming industry is set to keep growing. Current projections are a 9.17% growth rate for a total value of $256.97 billion in 2025. You can bet Corsair will get a slice of that. Corsair has their earnings report on August 3rd which is three weeks from today. Since going public, Corsair has beaten expectations every earnings report and I fully expect them to smash expectations this time as well. As soon as Corsair proves that it is not a reopening play and that it will continue to grow, the share price will stop being repressed and it will skyrocket to its fair value of $60.

{"text": "tl;dr at bottom So after using DD from u/Criand, I became pretty confident that there are some shady investment banks companies that are going to fail sooner rather than later. I wanted to find one that preferably: 1. was founded after 2008 2. had experienced insane growth in the last 10 years 3. wasn't too big to fail and most importantly; most likely over-leveraged themselves using Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBS) After sifting through investment banks, Ladder Capital seemed to be a good fit. And added bonus, the CEO, Brian Harris, has close ties to Adam Weisselberg - the Trump Campaign CFO who just got indicted for tax fraud. So I'm ready to make my sound investment on Robinhood. I was looking to buy $1500\\ worth of puts on $LADR that would expire in 6 months to a year. I felt like I knew $LADR was fucked, I just didn't know when they would go under. So the more time I give myself the better. \\Note that this $1500 is more than half of my portfolio, took me 3 years to save up for, and I have been saving it for a long term, riskier investment. So anyways, any put outside the money for $LADR sells for $0.01, so I put in an order for January of 2022. At the end of the day, it expired. I realized my mistake, and created a new order, but \"good until cancelled\", and put it in after hours. The next morning,I was notified that someone had sold me +300 contracts, and I excitedly went to look at the riskiest investment I've made to date. \u200b ( My heart sank when I saw the expiry date. So now I have two weeks for $LADR capital to dip under $10.00, otherwise I'm out of more than half of my portfolio that i've been building for 3 years. My lesson from all this? YOLOing your portfolio is actually pretty exciting. tl;dr: I put the wrong Expiry Date for a put order that I had done DD on, and essentially yeeted 3 years of my savings.

{"text": "Overnight reverse repurchase agreements (Repos) are spiking. [ For y'all Robinhood users here's a quick synopsis. Under a regular repurchase agreement by the Fed and a major bank, the Fed essentially puts liquidity into the banking system by exchanging cash (that can be used right away) for U.S gov't treasury bills (that are usually dated out 2, 5 or 10 years). In a reverse repo, the opposite happens. The Fed exchanges U.S gov't treasuries for cash, essentially removing liquidity out of the banking system. Commercial bank's are required to keep what's known as a reserve requirement to ensure liquidity. As deposits (from people making more money as a result of new money being printed) into banks increases, the amount of capital a bank must keep as a reserve also increases. The problem is, banks can't loan out capital that's being used to meet reserve requirements. Additionally, in March of 2021, the Fed ended the rules that relaxed the supplementary leverage ratio which allowed banks to exclude treasuries and deposit from their reserve requirements which means banks are now (once again) required to hold more capital for reserves. In order to loan out these new deposits, Banks are telling their corporate customer's to put their money in money-market accounts (since these don't require banks to keep capital as reserves). (See: [ . As a result of this, the size of money market funds are increasing dramatically. ([ Money-market funds buy short dated U.S treasuries (t-bills), but as the demand and use of these funds goes up, the supply of U.S treasuries is decreasing. This is why over-night reverse repurchase agreements are spiking. Banks are exchanging their cash for these short dated treasuries. \u200b At the same time, the Fed is buying over $80 bln worth of U.S treasuries a month ([ and at the same time the U.S treasury department is underwriting less short dated bonds (in favor of 2, 5, and 10 years) to make long term debt cheaper. \u200b This means that either the T-bill market is going to squeeze. Or (the more likely outcome) is that the Fed slows open market operations, and removes liquidity by raising interest rates earlier than expected. \u200b My bet is emergency rate hike before Sept. The U.S debt ceiling requirements are kicking back in at the end of July as well. \u200b This will probably cause a drop in the equities, but idk what do y'all think? \u200b \u200b tl;dr: That guy buying the $40 $SPY 7/16 puts might be onto something. edit: SPY $400 NOT $40 jfc", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-07-08 08:34:17", "id": "ofsnmy"}

{"text": "Astra Space, Inc. has captivated investors with its nimble rockets designed for frequent, cost-efficient launches. Astra is the first space launch company to trade on the Nasdaq, according to the company. Rival Virgin Orbit, the sister company of Virgin Galactic (SPCE by 2025. \u201cWhat is really starting to cause Astra to stand out from everyone else out there is our focus on scale,\u201d Astra CEO Chris Kemp told SpaceNews in an interview. Not the scale of the rocket, but the scale of the factory and the scale of production and the number of launches.\u201d He said customers are willing to pay a lot more for responsiveness than \u201cwaiting six months or a year\u201d for launches that could potentially face more delays. \u200b Alameda, California-based Astra has been hiring former SpaceX employees that helped set up the Falcon 9 production line, as well as senior staff from Tesla from the Bay Area, to help scale up its factory facilities to meet this demand. Benjamin Lyon, who spent more than two decades supporting the mass production of Apple products, including iPhones and iPads, joined Astra as chief engineer in February. Astra anticipates unveiling its first customer when a launch date this summer for its upgraded Rocket 3.3 has been set. It will be its first launch since Rocket 3.2 fell just shy of reaching orbit in a Dec. 15 demo mission after running out of fuel early. Astra\u2019s SPAC merger proceeds will help scale up operations and expand its vertically integrated approach to space, which June 7 saw it acquire electric propulsion venture Apollo Fusion in a deal valued at up to $145 million. Apollo Fusion thrusters will boost Astra\u2019s move into the small satellite manufacturing business next year, enabling it to provide launch and space services beyond LEO. Astra also plans to grow the payload capacity of its rockets from 50 kilograms to 500 kilograms, targeting growing demand from satellite megaconstellations. Asked whether Astra\u2019s vertically integrated strategy could lead to acquisitions outside of rockets and spacecraft, Kemp said: \u201cAre we going to start laying fiber-optic cables under the ocean? I don\u2019t see that coming. I think there are some great companies that have done that. \u201cI think that, in terms of building the infrastructure in space, vertically integrating that and building that is where Astra\u2019s focus is, and so I think we\u2019ll certainly look to partnerships on the ground with the leaders in the infrastructure needed to support what\u2019s happening in space on the ground.\u201d Unlike launch providers SpaceX, Blue Origin and Rocket Lab, Kemp said Astra will not develop systems capable of human spaceflight, saying this enables it to optimize technology for applications closer to Earth. Astra also disclosed that it has a roadmap to develop larger vehicles, with the goal of placing up to 500 kilograms into orbit. The company did not disclose technical details of that roadmap, or a schedule for producing those larger vehicles. \u200b Kemp said plans for various mega constellations influenced that roadmap. \u201cWe want to converge with what these mega constellation operators are designing and flying in 2023,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about being the most responsive launch service provider and also being the best way for us to build our own platform.\u201d He described an iterative process for gradually scaling up the company\u2019s launch vehicles to achieve that 500-kilogram target. \u201cMy goal is to have as many iterations as possible, where the engineers can add these things incrementally,\u201d he said, gradually increasing performance instead of making a big jump from 50 to 500 kilograms. Astra is a company with intriguing potential to be profitable, in a sector which has proven to be a difficult one from this perspective. CEO Chris Kemp has stated the company\u2019s focus is on gaining efficiencies. And its attempt to build cheaper, better rockets could prove to be a win for shareholders, as well as humanity, over the long run. Accordingly, it appears investors are largely viewing ASTR stock as a long-term holding right now. This merger provides Astra with approximately $500 million in new capital. The company plans to build out its production of smaller rockets, hoping to get its price point below the current $2.5 million. Additionally, the company sees opportunities to grow its spacecraft and spaceport business lines. For long-term investors bullish on space-related stocks, this is music to the ears. As far as space-related stocks go, ASTR stock is one to keep on the radar for now. This company could see some serious buying pressure, if tailwinds persist in this space.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-07-03 04:05:08", "id": "ocefix"}

They just completed a 3 way merger between Beach body,Forest Road and MYX fitness about 2 weeks ago. A little info on this stock. The 3 way merger included Forest Road, MYX fitness which is a cycle bike company and Beach Body that is a connected fitness company who has over 20 years of growth under their belt. Beach body acquired Openfit in December of 2020 (Started by Lebron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger). This acquisition gave Lebron and Arnold a stake in the new BODY company. They are both going to be making their own content in the future for this company. Beach Body company is known for its exercises Insanity and P90X which helped countless people lose weight and change their lives for the better(Sean T is also a super trainer and he has been massive in fitness for as long as i can remember). The (Forest Road Acquisitions) is phenomenal. Here is a list of a few of the people involved in the deal. You will probably recognize Shaq and MLK the 3rd are apart of this company which I think is huge. IMO anything Shaq joins always seems to make waves.

The Forest Road Acquisition Corp. team includes three former Disney senior executives \u2014 Tom Staggs, director and Chairperson of the Strategic Advisory Committee, Kevin Mayer, strategic advisor, and Salil Mehta, Chief Financial Officer \u2014 and is strengthened by the strategic connectivity and deal-making expertise of directors, officers, and strategic advisors like Shaquille O'Neal, Peter Schlessel, Keith Horn, Mark Burg, Sheila Stamps, Teresa Miles Walsh, and Martin Luther King III. On top of this All-Star cast of people is the short interest. Yesterday I saw that it was over 40%! Today the stock hit its 52 week low due to the shorting that has been happening. This is the current Short interest (around %38.09). The BODY company is now flush with cash around $420,000,000 coming from the closing of the merger. They are planning to do an advertising campaign in the coming weeks for around $75,000,000. I am not sure of the specifics but if they include Lebron, Arnold, Shaq or the Cycle bikes that should really send this stock in the right direction. Here is some info on the combined company. A diverse portfolio that appeals to a broad consumer base through a holistic approach that brings together at-home, digitally enabled fitness, nutrition and community Generated 2020 pro forma revenue of $880 million across BOD, Openfit and Myx, which achieved $30 million of revenue in its first year of operations 2.6 million paid digital fitness subscribers with 96% month over month retention Industry-leading 89% gross margins on digital subscription revenue across all three brands The deepest library of premium fitness content in the industry that generates more than 180 million views annually A premium portfolio of branded nutrition products that are scientifically developed, clinically tested and strategically paired with fitness content for a holistic health and wellness experience Scalable platform that enables synergies across distribution, marketing and content creation Management team with over 22 years of experience creating content, acquiring customers and delivering substantial revenue and EBITDA * Well-positioned to unlock accelerated growth and expects to achieve compound annual revenue growth of 30% over the next 5 years As you can see this company is already profitable. The CEO called it the bargained price Peleton. This is the most cash they have had on their balance sheets and they were up to $880,000,000 without this added capital. The brand awareness should sky rocket after they start broadcasting the new commercials. The biggest catalyst for the stock besides the short interest is the addiction of BODI live interactive. (Beta testing in August and rollout in September) Most likely they are trying to drive this thing down to get in cheap for this huge event) They are using the technology seen in the NBA and WWE to stream users live into a class setting and have them on a TV where the instructor can interact with them and help them with their form and encourage them. This should be a big deal as it bring interaction that has never been seen besides what the cycling classes are doing. [ This is revolutionary for online fitness. It will bring the gym straight into your home and is a very exciting Segway into the future of fitness. I know most people who have tried to get in shape have bought gym memberships that they barely use at some point in their life and they spend money every month on nothing. Beach Body has 2.6 million paid subscribers at this time. It should continue to grow. Needless to say the companies that have been invested in lately for short squeezes haven't been profitable or sustainable. This one seems to fit the bill of Short Squeeze candidate and a good investment for the future! When I first came across Peleton it was at $17.50. The 52 week high within a year of this low was a high of $171.09. They don't nearly have the library of workouts that BODY has. They don't have the star power of the people I mentioned above. Their exposure started with a controversial commercial that got people talking about the company. This went almost 10x without a short squeeze and any real spokesperson for the stock. Needless to say it seems that BODY could moon! (Peleton commercial below) [ I apologize for the long DD but this company is so low right now I feel I have to share everything that I have learned about them. This isn't financial advice just someone trying to be on the cutting edge of a new public company I think has some great promise! There is a ton of room to grow in all segments of this business. I believe the cycle bike is the best Peleton alternative and it is much cheaper compared to the Peleton bike. Peleton recently had issues with their treadmill sucking kids, pets and other objects underneath them. This leaves some people that would rather find a nice alternative. The swiveling screen on the bike connects to other fitness classes and you can use that screen to get other workouts in as well as cycling classes. [ I am now a shareholder in the company and very excited to see what the future brings! Happy investing and hope you guys learned something from this DD!", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-07-15 09:27:40", "id": "okfasr"}

{"text": "Let\u2019s do a little marijuana tax math. Water is 8.34 pounds per gallon, while pure ethanol is 6.53 pounds per gallon. \"Distilled spirits generally are taxed at $13.50 per proof gallon \\\". (TPC, May 2020). Meaning a \u201cproof gallon\u201d should weigh 7.435 pounds. This means that a pound of alcohol is taxed a $1.82 per pound. \u201cStates currently levy three types of marijuana taxes: as a percentage of price (either the retail or wholesale price), based on weight (i.e., per ounce), and based on the drug\u2019s potency (i.e., THC level). Some states use a combination of these taxes.\u201d (TPC, May 2020). Keeping things equitable, ill use the potency taxing method, even though the percentage of price and weight based methods are much more common. \u201cIllinois is currently the only state with a THC-based tax \\. It \\ taxes products with a THC content of 35 percent or less at 10 percent of retail price and those with more than 35 percent at 25 percent of retail price. All marijuana-infused products (e.g., edibles) are taxed at 20 percent of retail price.\u201d (TPC, May 2020). Again, trying to keep things equal, I will go with the 25% tax rate; as a \u201cproof gallon\u201d is 50% alcohol and marijuana products with a THC content over 35% have a tax rate of 25%. A 1.75 liter of McCormick Vodka (pretty much the cheapest crap you can get, making the excise tax burden as heavy as is reasonably possible) is $10.99 at my local Total Wine here in Texas, meaning you could get a gallon of 40% alcohol for $23.86, adding 25% to the cost to make up for the extra you would have to buy to equal the 50% for a proof gallon (I cross checked the math) a consumers cost for a proof gallon works out to $29.825. The excise tax burden of $13.50 represents 45.26% of the purchase price before state tax in this scenario, which would only go down as the cost of the alcohol went up. This represent a 20.26% premium over the federally purposed 25% tax rate as part of federally legalized marijuana. Uncle Sam is going to get his cut either way, 25% actually isn\u2019t that bad. P.S. I will be investing in marijuana stocks or ETFs if things go legal. I really thought this was going to go the other way. References: Tax Policy Center. (2020, May). How do marijuana taxes work?

{"text": "\u200b # Positions or BAN I picked up Jan22 40 c's in late March and have been buying more periodically since then. Currently up to 25x Jan22 40 c\u2019s as I read more into their overall holdings and their recent large acquisitions. \u200b # Intro to VICI VICI Properties is a REIT that owns and leases a flurry of gambling centric properties. They were originally spun off from Caesar\u2019s in an effort to reduce taxes and got their start buying Caesar\u2019s \u201cHarrah\u2019s Las Vegas\u201d property for 1.1B and leasing it back to them for 87.5M per year in 2017. The next few years they went on a buying spree loading up on casinos and racetracks-- often below replacement cost- while leasing them back to operators at a substantial yearly rake. In 4 short years they went from their first 1.1B property to now holding over $17B in assets with a take of 374M in gross revs. # Thesis VICI\u2019s short life so far has yielded extremely aggressive acquisitions and expansions. Their double digit YoY increases on net revenues has had a strong upward pressure on their dividend yield of which they are bound to give 90% away because of their REIT status. This increase has historically been met with a matching upward pressure in their underlying share price. VICI has recently acquired The Venetian and increased their revenues over the pandemic. My hypothesis is that their normal business operations will significantly increase their dividend by $0.06 to $0.09 per share per quarter combined with a Venetian upshot. These combined will push prices up to the mid 40\u2019s by Jan of 2022. # Research ## Financials VICI swings 17B in assets with 7.4B in liabilities. This debt load is best-in-class for a gaming centric REIT. For comparison we can look at MGM (ticker: MGP) which has 10B in assets for 4B in liabilities or Gaming & Leisure Properties (ticker: GLPI) which has 9B in assets and 6.3B in debt. As a REIT VICI utilizes the AFFO (Adjusted Funds From Operations) metric as their primary measure of cash ingress. There\u2019s a strong correlation between their AFFO/share and their distribution of dividends since they are bound to give most of their cash away. As of Q1 2021 they announced that AFFO per share increased 23.7% to $0.47 for the quarter- more on AFFO and what it means for us later. ## Analyst Coverage Coverage is generally positive with a single hold out in a bearish mood. Analyst Ratings (\u201cLVS\u201d) all of the land and real estate assets associated with the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center, located in Las Vegas, Nevada (collectively, the \u201cVenetian Resort\u201d), for $4.0 billion in cash, representing a 6.25% cap rate. An affiliate of certain funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc. (the \u201cApollo Funds\u201d), has agreed to acquire the operating assets of the Venetian Resort for $2.25 billion, subject to customary closing conditions. Simultaneous with the closing of the transaction, the Company will enter into a triple-net lease agreement for the Venetian Resort with an affiliate of the Apollo Funds. The lease will have an initial total annual rent of $250.0 million and an initial term of 30 years, with two ten-year tenant renewal options. LVS has agreed with the tenant to provide lease payment support designed to guarantee the tenant\u2019s rent obligations under the lease through 2023, with early termination of such lease payment support if the tenant achieves a certain 3financial milestone or a tenant change of control occurs. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is expected to be completed by year-end 2021. In summary they bought the Venetian for 4B in cash, sold the operating rights for 2.25B and then charged the operator on a triple-net lease 250M per year. Genius. Including the proceeds from the operating rights that they sold back to the operator this property is pushing a 14% cap rate! ## Holding Acquisitions vs Dividend Yield vs Share Price ### Dividends We can see here that we got a dividend bump rapidly upon IPO and then annually every September from then on out. In particular let\u2019s pay attention to September 2018/19/20 where we went from .287 to .298 to .33. \u200b |Ex/EFF DATE|TYPE|CASH AMOUNT|DECLARATION DATE|RECORD DATE|PAYMENT DATE| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |06/23/2021|CASH|$0.33|06/10/2021|06/24/2021|07/08/2021| |03/24/2021|CASH|$0.33|03/11/2021|03/25/2021|04/08/2021| |12/22/2020|CASH|$0.33|12/10/2020|12/23/2020|01/07/2021| |09/29/2020|CASH|$0.33|09/10/2020|09/30/2020|10/08/2020| |06/29/2020|CASH|$0.298|06/11/2020|06/30/2020|07/10/2020| |03/30/2020|CASH|$0.298|03/12/2020|03/31/2020|04/09/2020| |12/26/2019|CASH|$0.298|12/12/2019|12/27/2019|01/09/2020| |09/26/2019|CASH|$0.298|09/12/2019|09/27/2019|10/10/2019| |06/27/2019|CASH|$0.287|06/13/2019|06/28/2019|07/12/2019| |03/28/2019|CASH|$0.287|03/14/2019|03/29/2019|04/11/2019| |12/27/2018|CASH|$0.287|12/13/2018|12/28/2018|01/10/2019| |09/27/2018|CASH|$0.287|09/17/2018|09/28/2018|10/11/2018| |06/27/2018|CASH|$0.262|06/14/2018|06/28/2018|07/13/2018| |03/28/2018|CASH|$0.16|03/15/2018|03/29/2018|04/13/2018| \u200b ### Acquisitions Ripped from all of the quarterly press releases VICI put since 2018- #### Summary July 2018, Octavius Tower- 507M December 2018, Harrah\u2019s Philadelphia Casino and Racetrack- 82.5M January 2019, Margaritaville Resort Casino- \\~115M May 2019, Greektown Hotel Casino- 700M - resold operating rights of 114.9M September 2019, Jack Cincinati- 186.5M December 2019, Century Casino Cape Girardeau and Mountaineer Casino, Racetrack & Resort- 277.8M January 2020, JACK Cleveland Casino and JACK Thistledown Racino- 843.3M July 2020, Harrah\u2019s New Orleans, Harrah\u2019s Laughlin, and Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City - 3.2B Of the rent bearing gaming properties we gained \\~600M of assets in 2018, 600M in assets for 2019 and then a monster 4B in 2020.

Combined rent under the Las Vegas Master Lease and Regional Master Lease between VICI Properties and Caesars increased $252.5 million per annum. ### Price Interaction on Div Increases As we get dividend increases in September and my play is based on LEAPs that expire Friday of Jan I\u2019m going to be measuring \u201cPrice % Increase by the 3rd Friday of Jan after div increase\u201d vs VNQ, the Vanguard Real Estate ETF. VICI: 9/28/2018 - 1/18/2019 = 21.62 -> 21.11 = -2.36% VNQ: 9/28/2018 - 1/18/2019 = 80.68 -> 79.43 = -1.55% VICI: 9/30/2019 - 1/17/2020 = 22.65 -> 26.27 = 15.98% VNQ: 9/30/2019 - 1/17/2020 = 93.25 -> 94.72 = 1.58% VICI: 9/30/2020 - 1/15/2021= 23.37 -> 25.16 = 7.66% VNQ: 9/30/2020 - 1/15/2021= 78.96 -> 84.61 = 7.16% We can see a general out-performance of VNQ during this highlighted play period post dividend increase. ## Estimating the new dividend The primary properties that determine the new dividend is 1. the fact that the REIT is required to give out 90% of taxable income 2. Taxable income 3. Future increases in taxable income from new business For 2018 Q1: AFFO (Adjusted Funds from Operation aka VICI\u2019s preferred measure instead of EBITDA) of $0.36 per diluted share Established dividend, started at $0.16 and ramped up to 0.2875 by Q4 For 2019 Q1: AFFO per share 0.37 Increased quarterly cash dividend by 3.48% to 0.2975 in Q4 For 2020 Q1: AFFO per share 0.38 Increased quarterly cash dividend by 10.9% to 0.33 in Q4 For 2021 so far: AFFO per share increased 23.7% to $0.47 so far for Q1 We have a fat acquisition of The Venetian incoming The Company estimates AFFO for the year ending December 31, 2021 will be between $1,010.0 million and $1,035.0 million, or between $1.82 and $1.87 per diluted share (about 0.45 to 0.47/share/quarter) We can see a high correlation between AFFO and dividend output where they try to stick as close to AFFO without going over. Now we increased AFFO by 9 cents and we haven\u2019t even gotten the Venetian yet. The company itself believes that it\u2019s first quarter results are going to be about the same for the rest of the year. I\u2019m estimating a $0.06-$0.09 (18-27% increase in div yield) and higher if they manage to close the Venetian early. ## Technicals \u200b The grey boxes drawn highlight bounces off of the 100SMA on the daily candles. I consider this rock solid support and I believe we are unlikely to breach below this short of a market downturn. Extending the 100SMA yields a LOWER bound price target of 33.91 by September and about 38.65ish by the middle of Jan. ## Risks Besides the generic risk of securities, the fact that VICI is a REIT bears the extra burden that REIT\u2019s are considered less attractive than growth stocks during bull runs. As we get into a reopening phase AND with the backing of the Fed AND the tail winds of inflation pushing up asset prices REIT\u2019s might suffer more than usual. ## Safeguards VICI\u2019s business model has no interest in the actual operation of these properties and simply seeks to collect rent from the property itself. The transactions often involve getting a \u201cdiscount\u201d on the property by selling back the operating rights of the subject property to the original sellers. This has the dual effect of lessening their net cost while also making sure that they are renting to someone that just got a fresh infusion of cash. This model proved to be COVID resistant and will likely be resistant to any potential future shutdowns from new variants. ## Play Summary I believe the dividend yield is going to be closer to the top end of the estimate which gives us just under a 1/3 increase. Given current price, previous reactions to dividend yield increases and the lower bound from technicals pushing us above 38.65 I\u2019m estimating price in the mid 40\u2019s by Jan 2022 hence my Jan 2022 $40 strike calls.

{"text": "I was holding call positions on $MU through May-June like a good ape \ud83e\udd8d. Here\u2019s why I switched to puts. DRAM won\u2019t be in short supply for long and smart money knows it. This means the prices for DRAM (which make up 70% of $MU\u2019s revenue) aren\u2019t going to continue increasing. In fact\u2026 they\u2019ll likely peak October then start dropping. Reason #1: Now my fellow apes may ask\u2026 \u201cbut peaceinpieces, Bloomberg articles tell me semiconductors are in a huge shortage\u201d.

{"text": "This article first appeared on SchiffGold on Monday and also appeared on ZeroHedge this morning. # 3 Key Takeaways 1. If the Fed tapers QE, it may reveal waning appetite for long-term treasuries 2. The Treasury may have used its cash balance reserve to anchor inflation expectations 3. If inflation persists, the Fed may have to increase rather than decrease QE Note: By definition, inflation is an expansion of the money supply. In this article inflation will be used interchangeably with rising prices (usually as a result of money supply expansion) ## Introduction When the economy was shut down in March 2020, the government responded with massive fiscal and monetary support. The fiscal stimulus totaled $4T+ in relief packages. All of this spending was paid for with debt being issued by the Treasury. The Treasury mostly issued short-term debt. With rates being held at zero by the Fed, and strong demand for short-term debt, it made sense to quickly raise cash using Treasury Bills as interest free loans. The Fed monetary policy was two fold, slash short-term rates to zero and inject $1.5 trillion into the long-term debt treasury market. The effect was to bring down interest rates across the entire yield curve. After the initial debt binge, QE changed to auto-pilot, buying about $80B a month in long-term debt (plus another $40B in Mortgage debt). Over the last year, the Treasury has continued to issue long-term debt, averaging more than the $80B the Fed has been buying. This has caused long-term rates to rise. All of this fiscal and monetary stimulus is not without cost. Historically this type of activity almost always leads to higher inflation. The Fed may have recently indicated they want higher inflation, but this is not true. This stance simply provides cover for them to not act in the face of rising prices. To actually fight inflation, the Fed would have to increase short-term rates above the rate of inflation. Part 1, the Fed has another problem. Rising long-term rates send an important message: rising inflation expectations. While inflation is first and foremost a result of monetary policy, higher inflation expectations quickly exacerbate the problem. This is why the Fed has been messaging they are okay with higher inflation and also why they have been pounding the table that inflation is transitory. They need to keep inflation expectations low! If inflation expectations were to rise, especially at this critical juncture, it would be game over for the Fed, as they would have to raise short-term rates (devastating the Treasury and economy) in order to save the dollar and squash inflation. With the economy opening up in March of this year, things were getting very precarious as inflation was rapidly rising along with surging long-term rates. Remember that rising long-term rates indicate rising inflation expectations. This could cause transitory inflation to be much less transitory. In summer 2020, the Treasury issued enough debt to build up a significant cash reserve. In response to rising long-term rates in Q1 2021, it appears the Treasury strategically used its cash reserves to slow down the issuance of long-term debt. With total short-term debt outstanding already so high, the cash balance gave the Treasury ammunition to decrease debt issuance just as a $1.9T stimulus bill was passed and inflation was set to explode higher. This would have been perfect timing to support the Feds narrative that inflation is transitory to keep expectations from snowballing out of control. If inflation doesn\u2019t slow in the coming months, the Fed may be forced to step in. With the Treasury poised to issue more debt, it can no longer rely on its one time use of excess cash reserves. This will put more pressure on the Fed to clamp down long-term rates by increasing rather than decreasing QE. Yes, the Fed may decide to print more money (leading to higher prices) to fight rising inflation expectations (higher long-term interest rates). # Understanding recent fiscal and monetary maneuvers Last year when the pandemic hit, the US Government started spending Trillions of dollars. Massive spending plans were approved in the name of stimulus and Covid relief. Because the Government does not have much money on hand, and taxes cannot quickly be raised, the Treasury issued trillions in debt. The markets can easily absorb short-term US Treasury Bills, so when the Fed abruptly cut rates to 0%, the Treasury responded by issuing short-term debt to the tune of $2.4T from March to June 2020. See figure 1 below. \u200b Figure 2: Source - Treasurydirect.gov . What gives? One look at the Treasury Cash Balance sheet in the chart below tells almost the entire story. This was first highlighted by a SchiffGold article, this would have been a difficult narrative to push. The Fed needs inflation expectations to remain in check or else inflation will be anything but transitory. Thus, the perfect time for the Treasury to pause issuance of long-term debt would be April-June 2021 just as the economy is re-opening and the Fed is forecasting inflation to be at its worst before coming back down. While this is speculation, it would be a very strategic move from both Powell and Yellen. Regardless of the intention though, the problem is that the Treasury has now spent its large cash balance. It could return to the short-term debt market, but the outstanding balance is still sitting above $4T (see part 1 over the last decade. The Fed is making the market seem strong, but as shown above, there might be nothing but air if they were to exit the market. With a thumb on the scale, no one is getting an accurate reading of true demand for US long-term debt. \u200b Figure 8: Source - Warner Brothers could be causing the stress in the Reverse Repurchase market. The chart below shows the current Reverse Repurchase market. Based on past quarter end data, it\u2019s very possible that Reverse Repurchases could exceed $1.5T by this coming Wednesday June 30th before coming back down. \u200b Figure 9: Source - . Unfortunately for the Fed, the Treasury will have to begin re-issuing debt again. Will it lean towards short-term debt hoping the Fed keeps interest rates low, or long-term debt hoping the Fed will expand QE? The Fed may be constrained either way because it has its own problem though. Powell must be praying that inflation readings come in low AND job numbers disappoint. If both don\u2019t occur, then tough questions will be asked to justify more stimulus. Yellen and Powell may be best buds, but simple coordination will not be enough. They will need magic and luck to keep the course steady heading into 2H 2021 and 2022. If the Fed is lucky enough to get low inflation readings out of its rigged CPI it may provide cover to begin tapering. Rising long-term rates won\u2019t have the same compounding effect on inflation expectations in a \u201clow\u201d inflation environment. Unfortunately though; long-terms rates will not be tenable over the medium term as the government has to finance more and more debt. As the market this year has indicated, when issuance surpasses Fed buying, rates have gone up. So what happens to rates when the Fed leaves the market entirely? Presumably, they go up a lot. How high will the Fed let rates go before re-entering? Just because something is inevitable (US Debt spiral) does not make it imminent; however, the next six months of data may shine a bright light on all the irresponsibility over the last 12 years if inflation proves not so transitory. Chances are, the only thing transitory will be \u201ctalking about talking about\u201d tapering. \u200b", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-07-02 07:27:13", "id": "obufn3"}

I'm in no way a hater of meme stocks and I happen to own plenty of Clover, Sofi etc because I believe in the companies that I'm investing in. What pisses me off is the utter neglect of RKT while you apes are loading up on complete bullshit companies like Wish, cow farts etc. There's plenty of good DD on here if you ape brains are able to find the search bar but allow me to give you a couple of highlights. 1. Q1 2021: $4.6B in revenue, 236% YOY increase. 2. 90% customer retention rate 3. RKT enjoys approx 10% of a 3.5T consumer lending market. 4. Recently launched Rocket homes, Rocket Auto etc. Both of these have massive potential, Zillow anyone? Now let's get into the bullshit FUD that has been keeping this stock near its IPO price. Housing bubble blah blah, you've been watching too many YouTube videos. Yes housing prices have been going up but you have to look deeper and you'll see that's its because of the pandemic and more people are working remotely making this a opportune time to move to the suburbs etc. The 2008 housing crisis was a direct result of subprime mortgages but there's none of that these days. Speak to anyone applying for a mortgage and they'll tell you that banks are very strict these days and qualifying for a mortgage has never been more tedious. Housing market is cooling off but May's pending home sales were up 8% vs a negative number expected. Rockets CEO projected lower gain on sale margins on the conference call because he believed at the time that the yield on treasuries will rise in Q2 due to all the inflation talk but that hasn't happened. If you are lazy to check, the yield on the 10 year is 1.32% which is far lower than anyone expected. Bottom line is you have a company that is severely undervalued and this stock will be $60 in the not so distant future and you'll be kicking yourself for not pulling the trigger below $20. Oh did I mention anything about the 1B pending stock buy back? Position: 15x $25.89C 1/21/22 Tldr, RKT CEO is not a little bitch unlike the \"other\" mortgage provider.

{"text": "If you're into meme stocks with negative revenues, and maximum potential to lose your 401k, move along. I'll keep this short because you autists are not into reading. The ticker is SU. This is a 100-yr Canadian oil company with strong vertical integration (i.e. they get oil from the ground and sell it to you, controlling all the downstream, upstream and intermediate steps). They mainly do oil-sands, but their downstream business protects them from oil price fluctuations. They have been beaten to a pulp with CoVID-19, although they were one of the very few oil companies to maintain positive cash-flow (mainly due to their downstream business). Their forward P/E is 8, which is one of the lowest in the industry now. In the past week, they were dragged down as they were finishing a rising wedge within their upward channel. \u200b Here is the cool thing: their price usually tracks Brent Crude (although more accurately it would WCS, but only fucking nerds will care about this). Whenever the stock price diverges from the crude price, it catches up as it approaches earnings date. See below for the past year. \u200b Now, the earnings date is July 28, and we should expect the price to catch up with brent crude closer and just after the date. They are also likely to announce some degree of buybacks or dividend hikes as they focused on paying down debt 2021Q1. They are trading at huge discount. This is a 2x-5x opportunity for us autist to capitalize on this. What do analysts say? Smart shitheads in expensive suits give this buy or strong buy ratings with price target of 30+. \u200b The play is Sept 17, $25 strikes which are dirt cheap or Jan '22 $30 strikes, which are a lottery ticket, but reasonable as oil demand continues to grow and OPEC+ deal allows only for modest output increases monthly. Oil prices are also likely to go up, which increases the profit margins for SU. \u200b TL;DR: don't get fucked by the gas at the pump, make some $$ on rising oil prices. EDIT: to clarify to some people, yes, being down today is not surprising because it's still finishing its bearish pattern.

There seems to be a lot of misinformation (likely for pump purposes) or lazy research out there. If you\u2019re just riding the pump or are doing a covered call play, god speed. You may not care about this post. For anyone actually planning on holding through August 3, 2021, especially those trading on RH, please consider the following: Shen sold their telecommunication business to T-Mobile (T) for $1.94 Billion (I\u2019ll refer to this as TA) $936.6 million to shareholders via special divided of $18.75 $684 is going to be used to pay down debt The rest towards taxes I believe After the sale of the telecommunication business, Shen will shift its focus to it\u2019s broadband and tower business. I\u2019ll refer to Shen post-sale of their telecom business as ShenP. PE and Earnings Moving Forward The EPS for TA for 2020 was $2.48 and $0.97 last quarter (this is very solid) The EPS for ShenP was $0.05 in 2020 and a solid $0.06 last quarter, 2022 forecasted EPS of $0.29 The revenues for ShenP were $220.78M and are forecasted to grow 10.6% for 2021 ($244.2M) and 2022 ($270M) Google and yahoo give you a PE of 18.59 (I\u2019ve seen this same number in posts), but ShenP\u2019s PE for last Q\u2019s earning is closer to 254 and the forecast for 2022 is a PE of 210. These are based on $61 per share. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re still comfortable dealing with share price of $42.25 (61-18.75) because you get that juicy dividend, the PE is still very high at 176. I\u2019ve also seen a lot of information and spamming of don\u2019t worry about your shares there will be a buyback after August 3, 2021. The buyback is about $20 million dollars. This is not worth talking about. Insignificant. Just being used as pump fodder. (Haven't see anything else related to a buyback) Insiders didn\u2019t hold many shares but they have been dumping this thing and now hold less that 1% of shares, sales as recent as June 10, 2021 for $50.43. To those of you without premarket capabilities, you are far more likely to get stuck hold bags during the eventual sell off. So what\u2019s a company with $220.78M revenue and a forward guided EPS of $0.29 worth to you? If you buy it at $61 and are stuck holding the bag at $42.25, the special dividend premium was eaten up by your loss, you\u2019re saying that company is worth $2.1 Billion dollars. You\u2019re paying $160M more than T-Mobile paid it\u2019s acquisition but the company you own has 16x less earnings. For transparency, I hold puts, many many puts. I am not trying to create FUD or telling you to sell, I just want people to know what they are buying, I decided to use forward guidance and last Q which was solid for ShenP instead of 2020 numbers to try to be as fair as possible.

{"text": "The following is a slightly edited excerpt from the book Security Analysis. The passage was written in 1934 and it is amazing how valid it is today. In security analysis, there are two general attitudes that go into determining the market price of securities. They are investment attitudes and speculative attitudes. Speculative attitudes include the following: Market factors: Technical factors Manipulative factors Psychological factors Speculative and investment attitudes may share the following attitudes: Future value factors: Management Competitive conditions Possible and probably changes in volume, price, and costs Investment attitudes are distinct from speculative attitudes in that they asses objective intrinsic value factors: Intrinsic value factors: Earnings Dividends Assets Capital and Debt Structure Terms of the issue Other metrics that are considered fact. All of these factors together form the attitude of the public towards the issue - causing them to present bids and asks at the price they deem appropriate to exchanges that in turn forms the current market price. Of course there have been many new developments since this was written, but big banks scalping for a few cents per share on each trade doesn't change the facts above. It seems like good practice to think about all of these before making a purchase or sale to form a final opinion on if the transaction is an investment or a speculation, and even to think about what the person on the opposite side of the transaction is thinking. Also goes to show that if efficient market theory really does exist, then the value of equities may be extremely disjoint with what its financial intrinsic value is.

I am going to list every brand in this post because there is nobody here to stop me. # Lets talk about the dividend Historically, Unilever's dividend per share has been growing at around 6.3% on an annual basis. The growth rate accelerated to 6.9% over the past 5 years, even though Unilever was one of the few large-cap consumer staple companies that did not engage in share buybacks in 2019 and 2020. Thus, if we assume that dividend per share will grow at 6% per year for the next 5 years and will then revert back to a 2% growth to be consistent with inflation, Unilever's implied share price based on a Dividend Discount Model (DDM) in Euros comes at 61.2 which is 29% higher than what it currently trades at in Amsterdam. \u200b The Company's segments include Personal Care, which primarily includes sales of skin care and hair care products, deodorants and oral care products; Food, which primarily includes sales of soups, bouillons, sauces, snacks, mayonnaise, salad dressings and margarines; Home Care, which primarily includes sales of home care products, such as powders, liquids and capsules, soap bars and a range of cleaning products; and Refreshment, which primarily includes sales of ice cream and tea-based beverages.

The Yeezy and Gap collaboration is set to be a huge rejuvenation Gap needs to reach the millennial market. Last night, Kanye has been previewing his new album Donda and is rumored to drop ( Traditionally, Kanye has always dropped cloths or shoes along with album releases. I've jumped into a bunch of various strike prices and expirations. I have plans to double my position over the next few days. Although the album might drop this Friday, it could be a week or two before the Gap collection drops. Earliest would be the line dropping this Friday at the same time as the album but not sure thats really possible given production struggles so we could see another pre-order but at least a line of product maybe. ( GAP was hitting the $35 mark a few times, it touched $37.63 at the 52 week high. If you look at the YTD graph, I have a feeling we are bottoming out and now is the time to go balls deep in some CALL options. ( All that said, I think a conversion like this happened a few months ago. GAP CEO: \\Rings Kanye\\ Ye: \"Yo\" GAP CEO: \"Hey Kanye, so like our board is asking about when your product line is going to be ready because we keep getting calls from people about the release date.\" Ye: \"You have to trust me on this but I'm about to drop an album and if you want this to be successful, we gotta line up the album release with the product line release.\" GAP CEO: \"But Kanye, we really really need to release this; its been almost a year with nothing released\" Ye: \"ight, I tell you what; take that round jacket and put that on pre-order. That will help you gauge numbers and all that.\" GAP CEO: \"Ok fine, love you.\" Ye: \"Love you too\" \\--- TLDR; I think $GPS is gonna become a meme stock once the Yeezy line drops and all these \"investors\" start jumping in on the hype.

{"text": "Hey all, I've been long on Xpeng since late last year and keep noticing ZERO hype about it where as all the hype regarding Chinese EV players landing with NIO. While I'm fond of both companies and think both will prove to be extremely successful and huge EV players in the next 10 years, I think ya'll need to pay attention to Xpeng moreso than NIO. Excluding fundamentals, Xpeng has shown consistently over the past three quarters faster and more significant growth quarter to quarter, and month over month than NIO. Those numbers are pretty non-negotiable because they're statistics, not opinion. NIO is still larger, but Xpeng is rapidly catching up. Lots of the claims I see around this sub are in regards to NIO \"being the future of Chinese ev because of luxury subscription services, battery swap options, and future expansion into European markets\"...can I ask what ya'll are smoking? Xpeng is ALREADY IN NORWAY. They entered Norway last during Q4 2020. Regarding battery swap...although it leads to faster charging solutions (because of lack of charge), it's not going to be sustainable and as faster actual charging solutions become available, this NIO service will become less of an advantage. For subscription services... Cmon guys. Ya'll know that these services were exactly the reason why NIO was on the brink of bankruptcy last year? It's a EV company! Not a luxury club. I really think people are overestimating that area as a future peer-advantage. Xpeng doesn't have to worry about any of that. They don't swap batteries, they simply altered their models to utilize LFP (Lithium phosphate batteries) instead of Lithium Ion. Lower range but faster charging and... Let's be honest. Chinese EV clients are going to be living in cities. LFP batteries with 80% the range for cheaper aren't a deal breaker by any means. Subscription services don't exist because they aren't a smart idea for EV companies, and XPENG ALREADY ENTERED THE EUROPEAN MARKET IN Q4 2020. Guys, they're already better than NIO in this area, not even counting growth potential. Xpeng devotes more money towards R&D than any of its competitors, has better tech already, and is the first EV Company to be launching a mass-produced Lidar equipped EV ever. All of this isn't including they're autonomous system with rivals Tesla and definitely exceeds NIOs tech. So my question stands...

{"text": "Earlier, I wasn\u2019t able to navigate creating a DD post correctly to show the similarities between how FB and WISH were manipulated downward to shake weak hands off the stocks with massive long term gains ahead. 1. Compare FB July 2012 through Mar 2013 to WISH Dec 2020 to Present? Market insiders who drove enthusiasm through the hyped FB IPO and the run up of WISH after its IPO make it their business to punish early investors with eyes on short term gains. They make huge profits on IPO run ups followed by shorting the very same hyped stocks mercilessly. 2. Why is this important? In the case of FB then and WISH now you see two stocks - one that got punished then and another that has gotten punished recently such their valuation levels made no sense. Both companies had post IPO had very little debt while experiencing rapid growth but their market cap dropped precipitously and in the case of WISH, to around 1.4 x sales. When valuations get out of whack like that and losses on individual investors force them to sell out of their positions, big investors always jump in to take massive long term stakes in which they reap massive gains. This then says to me that you should be patient in your investing. You could carefully invest using a number of strategies to make money without losing your position in a long term winner. Here are a few approaches: a. Average in your largest buys around large institutional investor buys as seen on level II trades b. Join the shorts with with PUT orders when algorithmic selling or manipulative downward price action is evident c. Sell LEAP covered CALLs if they are profitable d. Balance trading on margin to avoid margin calls Over time all that matters is that your trading account and positions in it are funded and not vulnerable to margin calls. A good early investment will usually prove to be one within two years. 3. What does this mean: Contrast manipulation vs value? First, understand that in the long run valuations matter. To get the best value an investor should pay the lowest price for a promising stock. When a stock price drops while the fundamentals of the company is improving like WISH who reported 76% YoY revenue growth but fell to $7.52 after hitting a $32.85 high you have to wonder why. Well a buyer at $32.85 now has the worst value given the stock is now worth $11.78. A buyer on the other hand who bought at $7.52 or near about like I did has the highest value especially knowing that the company\u2019s revenue is significantly increasing. Second, we as investors must learn to follow the money. Big buy orders that we have seen since the 52-week low of $7.52 has produced massive trading volume. Massive trading volume with increasing price per share and algorithm-based pullbacks are signs of extraordinary long term gains as seen in FB. And, if you go back to AAPL in roughly 2004 and 2005 you see similar price action and volume followed by the enormous gains that APPL has since produced. Manipulation is to me disingenuous price increase or drops against valuation. At either end whether through hype or unfounded bashing the unsuspecting and inexperienced investor is bound to lose. 4. Why did I deem FB and WISH price drops as manipulation? When a disruptive technology enters the market and is run up early only to reverse and drop over 50% and sometimes down 90% there to me is no other explanation that big investor pump and dump market manipulation. I do not claim this to be scientific analysis but rather common sense. To make one feel as though their initial investment was a bad one only to later reveal sometimes 200-fold gains is similarity someone telling you your winning lottery ticket was a loser. To me it should be criminal when big investors colluded with unscrupulous Law Firms who file fake lawsuits and post them all over every brokerage site or financial website and paid bashers are employed to drive down a stock price to encourage individual investors to sell their stakes at a loss as I believe is being done in the case of WISH.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-07-05 22:32:25", "id": "oeeiik"}

{"text": "Hey guys, I'm a frequent lurker here and decided to post today to give some insight about my hypothesis about why inflation could be transitory, but also why that's a bad thing. Again, this is just my hypothesis, always make sure you do our own research. Disclaimer, I currently work for a shipping company in California, so I can only provide insight about what's happening here. A big issue with shipping right now is, as Powell said, that we are in a bottleneck. Let me explain to you why. Usually when containers are shipped overseas from China to Long Beach or Oakland port, the containers are emptied at the port's warehouse, and the empty containers are subsequently placed back on the vessels and shipped back to China on vessels. Well right now, these empty containers are not being loaded onto the vessels, which is leading to a container shortage in China. As a result, shippers in China are struggling to find bookings for their shipments because of the high demand of containers. Before COVID started, the cost of 40 foot containers was about $2000. Now, we just received a quote for almost $20,000. That's TEN TIMES HIGHER than what it was before. Inflation is happening because vendors have to increase prices of their goods to accommodate for the higher shipping costs due to demand for containers. Therefore, isn't just pure inflation happening because of money being injected into the economy. This is due to a container imbalance across countries that is a lingering result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have a client who ships 40 foot container loads of shoes every month. Because the cost of a 40 foot container is now TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS, that client decided that it was too expensive and they would rather not ship. Guess what, if one client decides not to ship, there are many others that will stop shipping as well, and there is no sign that shipping costs will go down anytime soon. Well, when people stop shipping, demand for containers will drop, the number of containers that are present in the US ports and China ports will eventually reach equilibrium. Therefore, shipping prices will go down and price of commodities will go down as well. Transitory inflation, right? Guess what, when people stop shipping, economic activity will slow down, which is called a recession. Therefore, it could be a case that inflation is transitory; however, this could also accompany a recession or depression. Would love to hear all of your thoughts about this. tldr; Due to container shortage, shipping costs are skyrocketing. I hypothesize importers will not be willing to pay these costs and shipping activity will go down, leading to slower economic activity AKA. recession/depression", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-07-15 05:16:53", "id": "oka7vw"}

{"text": "In this DD, I will attempt to prove through overwhelming evidence, historical trends, market valuation, exponential growth, and more. That Virgin Galactic is criminally undervalued and is truly valued with other big name \u201cpotential stocks\u201d while being historically comparable to the commercialization of the plane. 1. What is Virgin Galactic? Virgin Galactic is an aerospace company that provides human spaceflight for private individuals and researchers. The company is focused on developing a spaceflight system to offer customers a multi-day experience culminating in a spaceflight that includes several minutes of weightlessness and views of earth from space. Easily summarized by themselves on their website saying their mission is \u201cto be the Spaceline for Earth, means we focus on using space for good while delivering an unparalleled customer experience\u201d They are a company attempting to commercialize space travel for the average person to be able to enjoy a trip to space. This, by itself doesn\u2019t give the company any value. Due to the unknown factors and ambitcious nature of this mission statement, it is understandable why investors would roll their eyes at the idea of this company and therefore making it not very valuable. However, due to the way Virgin Galactic is conducting itself and the way it presents itself as the first real attempt at making a commercial space traveling company, I believe this company has the potential to become one of the biggest travel line stocks in the world. 2. The market\u2019s value system Lets say hypothetically, within a certain sector, there was a subsection that only accounted for roughly 2% of the overall sector, and company A contributed 79% to said subsection. Now, it would be logical to assume that even though company A controls 79% of its subsection, it wouldn\u2019t be a big player, as it\u2019s entire subsection consists of only 2% of the overall sector. But what if I told you, that company A was in fact the largest company in its entire sector at a current market cap of 632 Billion dollars, and the runner up Company B, accounting for roughly 10% of all sells in the entire sector only had a current market cap of 248 Billion dollars. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve guessed by now, this isn\u2019t hypothetical. Company B is Toyota and Company A is Tesla. Tesla. A company that controls a small subsection in the overall car market, has extremely low sale compared to other car manufacturers, and has never turned a profit off selling cars is over 2 times more valuable then the next runner up. Why? While you could ague it\u2019s valuation a hundred different ways from retail interest to the overall Bull market. Simply put, Tesla is valued so highly for 1 major reason. Their potential. You can debate whether or not it\u2019s rational, but it\u2019s safe to say the market right now values a company primarily on its sector\u2019s projected growth and the company\u2019s own potential. While Tesla is the most drastic example, almost all the big technology companies are valued similarly. Apple is the largest company in the world because of the belief in their potential to continuously innovate in news ways that drastically change their entire sector. Amazon is almost universal rated a buy by most top analysts due to the potential they have in becoming a modern monopoly. Modern Criteria Value, is based not necessarily on current fundamentals and value, but the perceived potential a company has to grow within its sector. 3. Virgin Galactic\u2019s exponential potential On January 1st, 1914 the first ever commercial plane flew from St. Petersburg, Florida to Tampa, Florida. While not realized much at the time, this one flight would led to the creation of the multi trillion dollar industry that is modern day airlines. And now, with interest in space travel at an all time high, and test flights like the one this upcoming Sunday making it more of a reality, one has to ask. What\u2019s stopping history from repeating itself, and what will happen when investors realize this exponential market Space itself could potentially become. As Virgin Galactic push\u2019s to make itself the number one most valuable space company, past private companies like SpaceX (with a market cap estimated to be 75 billion), the potential in this extremely lucrative future market will soon be realized by investors as they continue to look for huge potential stocks. As far as Monday\u2019s flight is concerned, how successful it is and the announcement afterwards are secondary for Monday\u2019s price. The main determinant in Monday\u2019s price action will be how Virgin Galactic\u2019s flight is portrayed by the media. If it is portrayed poorly, or average. We will most likely see a rough sell off. However, I personally believe will see an image of hope and excitement painted, As the media proclaims this to be a great leap for humanity as a whole (over exaggerating for attention). In this case, we will see a massive run on Monday, with consolidation later in the week followed by more soaring. I hope you enjoyed reading my personal take on the overall situation regarding $SPCE.

{"text": "I came across a fintwit post today that showed monthly options are at an ATH average of $580bn a month. The majority of them concentrated in weekly expirations. It got me thinking about how much money is needed to payout the shorts should there be a week when the market decides to take another 20-30% crash. Quick maths, with tons of assumptions: Let\u2019s say there\u2019s $250bn in weekly puts. Let\u2019s say they\u2019re all bought ATM. Let\u2019s say the market crashes quickly and results in back to back limit downs so most people aren\u2019t even able to sell and the majority of them are held to pretty decent gains. If the markets drop 30% from say $360 (QQQ) that\u2019s $252. A weekly ATM put bought on Monday probably costs about $2 ($200). Assuming you held to full drop - that\u2019s 108 intrinsic value and $106 profit. Or $10,600. Or 5,300% gain per contract. This is just considering ATM puts. There\u2019s a good % that would be a few strokes lower and return something like 10,000-15,000%. In a week. Now let\u2019s take those returns and apply them to the $250bn in puts floating around each month. $250bn + 6,000% gain = $15 trillion dollars. Just in ATM weeklies! (Yes this is napkin math and wildly speculative and blah blah - I\u2019m illustrating a point). When you consider all the short positions, long term dates puts etc, the \u201ccost\u201d of a 30% weekly correction is probably in the 100+ TRILLION $ transfer of wealth to investors who are short American markets. There\u2019s SO much money waiting to be paid out to shorts that I honestly don\u2019t think the governments could possibly allow it because it\u2019s such a large chunk of money that it would completely distort the entire global economy. The market is never going to go UP 30% in a week. It\u2019s too large and there\u2019s no catalyst for such a thing to ever happen. So they can \u201cafford\u201d to payout calls overtime as they have slower, but steadier gains. However, I honestly think the government (namely the Fed) sees how much money is at stake if they allow the market to correct and I don\u2019t think they can foot the bill. Especially when you consider the lost 30% in market cap - it would be the single greatest wealth transfer in history. Tl;dr - there so much $ in leveraged short positions that a 20-30% crash in a week would be the largest transfer of wealth in history and possibly cost over $100 trillion in pay outs to bears.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-07-17 00:41:48", "id": "olh35j"}

{"text": "\u200b # La-Z-BOY Do We Need To Talk About This Company (LZB) A solid company financially with a record backlog that is poised to break out once the supply chain issues are sorted out. Company Overview La-Z-Boy is one of the world\u2019s largest residential furniture producers and have been around since 1927. They became well known after designing the reclining chair, which was an instant hit and gave birth to a new generation of lazy TV junkies whose ability to communicate slowly drifted away, as they did while relaxing on a soft comfy chair. Since then, they have expanded to manufacturing, importing, and selling a wide array of residential furniture including sofas, loveseats, chairs, sectionals, modulars, ottomans, and sleeper sofas in over 60 countries. They operate through three segments: The upholstery segment, the Casegoods segment, and the retail segment. The upholstery segment is their largest segment and is responsible for manufacturing and importing furniture to sell directly to La-Z-Boy furniture gallery stores and other major furniture dealers. The Casegoods segment imports, markets, and distributes casegoods (wood furniture) through three brands: American Drew, Hammary, and Kincaid. The retail segment sells furniture directly to the consumer through 354 company-owned La-Z-Boy galleries and an additional 561 independent Comfort Studio locations. Financials Overall La-Z-Boy\u2019s finances are very solid thanks to an amazing recovery year post-COVID. Financial changes YoY. The reaction is completely overblown and the stock oversold in my opinion here are some other highlights: Price ratio comparison DCF analysis over the next 6 years, I get a present value of $36.88, which is in line with the current price. However, I believe La-Z-Boy\u2019s actual growth will outpace even more liberal estimates as they: Successfully fill their backlog of orders Expand manufacturing capacity Continue to increase Joybird\u2019s profitability Continue their share buyback program (3.4 million shares available under current program) Take advantage of positive economic and housing trends I have a 1-year price target in line with other analysts at $46. Outlook La-Z-Boy smashed earnings so why did the stock tank? Because of foreseen supply chain issues. President and CEO Melinda D. Whittington said \u201cGlobal supply chain disruptions and headwinds related to raw materials and freight costs will cause some volatility in results\u201d. She admits that profit margins will take a hit as a result and delivery times will increase due to the supply issues. Fine, but does that warrant a 15% dip in the stock price considering how well they performed? Not in my opinion, for one, margin declines can be somewhat offset with price increases which I think consumers are expecting at this point anyway besides, if you buy a house, you HAVE to furnish it right? I believe the supply chain will sort itself out sooner rather than later. Almost all of their financials are up YoY dramatically and they have orders coming in non-stop. While the CEO didn\u2019t mention any specific details she consistently mentions \u201crecord backlog\u201d throughout the latest earnings report. La-Z-Boy is also doing what they can to increase their production capacity. The CEO states \u201cThe company anticipates ongoing incremental increases in manufacturing capacity throughout fiscal 2022 that will enable higher delivered sales\u201d. We can see this right in their cash flow statement with $38M spent on capital expenditures for FY\u201921. Some other bullish highlights include: The company repurchased 1.1 million shares for $44M Paid $17M in dividends Joybird, an e-commerce furniture retailer purchased in 2018 has become profitable The current housing boom shows no signs of slowing down and people who buy houses need...furniture! According to simplywallst which aggregates data from analysts the fair value for the stock is $48.72 meaning a 30% upside from the current price of $37.23 92% institutional ownership with Blackrock and Vanguard owning 16% and 10% respectively * We Americans are LAZY and love sitting on comfortable things that become even more comfortable with a lazy action like pulling a lever Check out what analysts think about La-Z-Boy and the price targets according to marketbeat: ( TL;DR: Company good. Stock good. Dumb dumb investors selling because company have short term supply issues mean low hanging banana for furry jungle dwellers.

Arkk holds ~22,367k(As of 14Jul) and Arkw holds ~5,311k(As of 06Jun). Assume arkk were trim, sell off = 710k \u00f7 ( 22,367k+710k+5,311k) = 2.5% Assume arkw were trim, sell off = 710k \u00f7 ( 22,367k+5,311k) = 2.6% Either scenario, total sell off is less than 3%. Considering if cathie is determined to sell a company, she would have sold off entirely like how she sold spce. Now, obviously cathie knows that her firm has influence over growth stocks and if her view of pltr did change, why would she sold less than 3%? As of today, pltr holds on top 16 spot for both arkk and arkw. All these facts suggest that cathie might buy even more pltr shares now that its on ~19% discount. Chances of it happening? More than 0%, that im sure. Now that Jedi contract has been cancelled and opens up to multiple vendors, im confident that pltr will get a slice of that $10b dollar 10year contract. Just 10% of that deal would lower the price to earning ratio significantly by providing $100m per year. Pltr has a strong reputation for US government and it's already known that pltr will support them even if the deal are not realised. With pltr handling multiple contracts with the government, that only meant pltr must be part of the consideration (Not on the cloud service side). So, the real question now is how would pltr expand their business since they are not short on cash(A 10-Q filing reveals $132 million in total PIPE (private investment in public equity) stakes in these businesses). Personally, I hope to see pltr become a company that is capable of utilising AI for mass expansion, thus providing individuals with customizable software for decisions making/suggestions providing.

{"text": "Preamble: There is a lot of publicity generated when a company is added to the S&P 500 or Russell Indices. The company usually gets a bump in stock price following the announcement and there is a significant increase in retail interest for the stock. The underlying principle for this is that institutional investors which track these indices would have to buy into the stock and that this would cause a considerable bump in the stock price. At the same time, there are some contradictory opinions regarding this expected jump in price. Some people believe that there would be profit booking following the index inclusion which would actually tank the stock price. What I wanted to analyze was Whether the stock price rise following index inclusion or would the profit booking cause to stock price to fall? This in turn would allow us to create the best strategy for trading using index inclusion news. Data: The data for index inclusion time was surprisingly difficult to obtain. This a. 1-week leading up to the index inclusion b. 1-week following the index inclusion c. 1-month following the index inclusion Results: . There was a 6% jump in stock price and almost 4x normal traded volume on that day. We can also see the profit booking following the index addition where the stock briefly dipped before continuing on its rally. Conclusion: The analysis does prove that stock prices positively react to index inclusion. But this is only applicable till the stock is added to the index. As we saw earlier, stocks rise 1 week leading to the inclusion and then fall due to profit booking. So, the best strategy to trade based on index addition is to buy the stock as soon as the news breaks and hold it till the day of inclusion. Google Sheet containing the data and my analysis: ( Footnotes \\ If you are a diligent investor, you can analyze the quarterly earnings report and understand whether the company is now in a position to be added to the index.

Disclaimer: I have been passive investor for most of my life, only this year, I have started being more active with trades and scalps.

Take all the information here with the grain of salt and do your own judgement. # About SHEN SHEN - 18.75$ / share Now to the actual play. To be honest, I too haven't known about SHEN since this announcement, I had couple of dividend paying stocks, but this opportunity was too good to ignore. SHEN is focusing more and more on their main revenue stream - broadband and decided to sell of their Wireless assets and operations to T-Mobile in an insane sale, but also stay there, all in while being fairly valued at 56 Moreover, selling a big portion of their assets to T-Mobile could make the company an acquisition target. Since they are popular in rural parts of the country, acquisition of SHEN could be an easy entry for any of the telecom giants to enter rural areas. Which in turn could further skyrocket the price, but that's purely a speculation. I am planning on holding after the special dividend pay out with selling a small portion of the position on the dividend payout and holding rest for the longer term. I would like to hear any opinions on this play, any bull/bear case is very welcome. Any criticism is welcome, let me know what you think ! # TL;DR Company paying out insane special dividend 18.75$/share on August 2nd if you hold shares before July 13th, while maintaining solid fundamentals. Position598 shares at 56.96 avg # UPDATE 1 Due to special dividend being greater than 25% of comapany's value. You would need to hold through the ex-dividend date in order to receive the dividend. Therefore you need to hold shares from 9.7.2021 through 3.8.2021 in order to receive the $18.75 special dividend. There is a 2 day settlement period for transactions. Therefore your shares have to be settled in by this Friday (9.7.) the latest in order to receive the special dividend # UPDATE 2 - THE PLAY - THE TENDIES - THE FREE MONEY Givens: \\- SHEN share price $60 (right now) \\- record date 7/13 \\- payable date 8/2 \\- ex-dividend date 8/3 Since the market takes 2 days to settle. The shares need to be purchased by Friday, July 9th to be on record with the company. Due to the circumstances of this special dividend, in order to receive payment, you need to hold through the ex-dividend date which means tying up funds for a little over 3 weeks. # Play: Purchase shares in multiples of 100, and buy an equal amount of puts with a $55 strike price expiring on 8/20. These currently trade for approximately $2/contract ($200 is the full value of contract). If purchased correctly your maximum downside potential is $7/share, even if the stock price falls below $53 after the ex-dividend date. However, here\u2019s the kicker. You are entitled to the full $18.75 special dividend because you held shares during the appropriate time frame. Therefore you are guaranteed to net approximately $11.75/share which is a return of 20% with little to no risk over the course of 3 weeks.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-07-05 23:33:10", "id": "oefpy4"}

I don't pretend to think this is a great list or even a good list but it's my list hah I first look at Tesla (I still think it is over valued but I like to see how it tracks). I then look at Ride, NKLA, QS. NKLA in my opinion being the trash of trash and a great example of how a bull market can keep anything afloat Lol Then I go to Pltr, Peloton, Bmbl, Door Dash, Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Snowflake. Then I go to Nakd, and Fold. Then I check out some classics like Pfizer, AT&T, Coca-Cola. I weirdly like to look at Moderna. Then I check out Endeavour Group Holdings, Coinbase, Thredup, Walkme. Then I check out Canopy. Then BB, AMC, GME. Then SLV, GLD. Then Trillium, CRISPR. Then onto the coins. Then RKT and SPCE. It is a weird routine I have each and every day almost. I think it provides a good exposure to a various class of equities sometimes by groups, sometimes by weird segments of the investing sphere. I think everything is insanely priced and way to high hah but we are in the everything bubble so that is what it is. All in all the classic narrative is that it provides me a good understanding of what is happening in the various big blocks of the investing world.

Did the merger talks go off the table? I don't think so, I personally think someone forgot to buy DOYU. Here's why. Below BABA, IQ, JD all moved along with HUYA on 6/23. This was the day where money flowed into Chinese stocks. However, no money flowed into DOYU, instead money flowed out. This is an oddity. \u200b \u200b Seekbeta, the popular FUD company posted an article and then deleted it. Titled: douyu-falls-as-investors-await-chinese-approval-for-huya-deal \u200b So what exactly is the reason for DOYU trading away from the sector instead of with the sector? Someone is pushing the price down for a reason. If the expectation is that the merger is not going to go through, why would you short a position before news of the merger not happening, just have puts or short the shares. Also, why would the price of DOYU flip down during a sector rotation? This leads to the conclusion that the price was pushed down and more shares were accumulated as the sector rotated higher. Huya goes up, DOYU goes down, buy more DOYU get more HUYA after the 0.73 swap. \u200b Let's say I was a DOYU bag holder and I see everything else going up, what would my instinct be? This is a shit stock! Why would this go down when everything else is ripping up? Emotions would tell me to sell and then move to better plays. When that happens, big boys come in and take my shares for dirt cheap and it eventually trades on par at 0.73 HUYA again. \u200b \u200b TLDR: DOYU and HUYA trading together but has a discount gap to fill.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-07-02 08:03:11", "id": "obv6i6"}

{"text": "Fellow retards, I don't have a position in $CLNE, so don't honestly care one way or another if anyone reads this, but I work in the natural gas industry for a larger utility company, and have first hand experience with RNG so thought I would share my insight. RNG is like the crackhead Craigslist of natural gas. In the state that I work in we purchase RNG from 6 suppliers for our gas distribution system, 2 landfill reclamation locations, and 4 large dairy farms, so the cow shit variety. Ever since it was introduced into our pipelines we've had nothing but problems with it. Biogas comes out dirty as hell, and needs a lot of work to refine and remove contaminants, before it's even usable RNG. It has to have excess moisture and particulate removed, processed to remove carbon dioxide, dinitrogen, organic compounds, siloxanes and a bunch of other gross shit we don't want in our gas. Farmer John don't know shit about the chemistry of gas, and neither does your trash man. They just know that garbage and cow farts smell like money, and wouldn't know what a gas chromatograph was if they caught it plowing their wife. They open the valve and get the meter spinning on their shitty gas flowing out into the system. Immediately we started getting water in our gas pipelines due to their poor attempts at meeting the required moisture levels in the RNG. Next was the high levels of sulphur, which fun fact, when combined with the water turned into sulphuric acid, that started eating our steel pipelines from the inside out. We ended up having to replace a few miles of pipeline closest to the worst farm because it caused so much damage before we realized it was happening. Next came the siloxanes, which turned into this hard white shit when high volumes of the gas were burned. We found this out the hard way, when our largest customer ($CLF) started having plugged orifices on some of their furnaces. I'm not one to kink shame, you can plug whatever orifices you want, but CLF was super not into it, and threatened law suits until we signed an agreement to never send RNG into their systems again. TLDR: If natural gas was an eightball of cocaine you bought from a dude who only spoke spanish in Miami, RNG is an eightball you bought in a trailer park in North Dakota. It still sort of gets you fucked up, but it cost twice as much and has so much baby laxative in it that you shit your pants the first time you tried to fart. Bearish on cow farts Edit: well damn my messages blew up with some big mad bagholders. Like I said I have no skin in this game, I was just trying to share the other side of the pump based on RL knowledge about the product. My company is still using the RNG in some of our systems, but it's only because of the carbon offsets it gives us with the government (the offsets let us burn more coal in our power plants). I assume the carbon offsets will be a selling point for large companies like AMZN, etc. But if it wasn't for the government giving carbon credits, nobody would want this product.

{"text": "The current narrative of real estate tech companies Zillow, Redfin, and Opendoor is that these companies are learning to efficiently monitize their (relatively recent) business of home flipping. This 'iBuying' of houses, where a home owner can sell directly Zillow, Redfin, and Opendoor, has some synergy with other revenue streams in the home-sector, such as mortgage lending, moving, renovations, renting, and insurance. A break-down of home flipping at scale, essentially: a home owner wants to sell his house, but doesn't want to get bogged down in the process of selling the house (fixing, renovating, countless showings to strangers, sentimental issues, bank stuff), so they \\one-click\\ (probably a handful of clicks, but not many) sell their house to a RE-tech company at an agreed upon price. For the three RE-tech companies I listed above, their iBuying service is only available in a few markets---like 20, 25 cities with predictable home price trends. Places like Arizona, California, Texas. Rich Barton, Zillow CEO / Co-Founder (who is a long-time tech badass, and like Musk and Dorsey has founded at least three companies with multi-billion dollar valuations---which puts him in a special class), said on the last earnings call that the target margin on their iBuying business is +/- 2%. This is a new business, and the dynamics are being tested out, but it looks good, he said. Getting the sale on their platform means more than the 2% gain (or loss) per each individual house because they can offer other products, like a mortgage or a listing advertisement. The house price itself is only one element of the whole Real Estate 2.0 vision. The competition between Zillow, Redfin, and Opendoor might play out like that of UberEats, DoorDash, and Grubhub, where each company is burning a lot of money by making their apps better and their products cheaper. But in the case of RE-tech companies, one is not like the others. If you compare the profitability of the three big RE-tech companies, the one that stands out is Zillow. They are the clear leader when it comes to home searches, and that top-of-funnel does give them an advantage home flipping in the same sort of way as Google or Amazon having the advantage in their own search results. \u200b Zillow showing 3 quarters of Positive Operating Income for 4 quarters of profitability, which is required for inclusion into the S&P500 index---index fund managers need to buy a proportion of shares of any company that is included in that index, boosting its stock price. Using Hypercharts, I wanted to compare other industry leaders to see what kind of operating income was normal for a growth company. The graph turned out to be pretty surprising: \u200b A profit comparison of Zillow, Spotify, Snap, and Square is only $30B, three times less. Again, the operating income is what we would call the money these companies make\\---it's the size of the checks they are putting into the bank. \u200b This is only Part 1 of my DD. Please like for Part 2, which will look deeper into the financials. \u200b TLDR: Zillow is the market leader in Real Estate. iBuying could be competitive, but Zillow is already making a surprising amount of money.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-07-07 07:59:29", "id": "ofc5gu"}

{"text": "Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation and Analysis (Q2 Week 2) - $NFLX, $SNAP, $TWTR, $KO, $T, $CLF, $NUE, and More What's poppin' bull gang, hope you're ready for week two of earnings! This week is jam packed with companies reporting within highly volatile sectors, the most notable being steel and airlines, so keep an eye out for those! Alongside those, we've got a handful of boomer blue-chips pulling through as well, whom I'm expecting beats from all across the board. There's a lot of money to be made this week, especially with collateral plays. - Airline stocks also move in tandem with each other. Similar to above, $AAL, $LUV and $ALK all report Thursday morning. If you're looking to make a collateral play, look to play $DAL or something to avoid the IV crush. Alternatively, you can also look to go long or short on the entire sector through $JETS. The IV on $JETS is half that of the reporting tickers, meaning we\u2019ll get huge gains on a relatively small move. This is key, since we\u2019re going to get a large move in $JETS as the entire sector will fly (lol) or crash after Thursday since the market will price all airline stocks, not just $AAL and $LUV, based off of the $AAL and $LUV earnings. On average, airlines move around 4.5% post earnings, so we should see a comparable movement in $JETS. If we get such a move in $JETS, we\u2019ll have at minimum a five bagger on deck.

{"text": "Positions: 145 shares @ 91 The Play: Buy shares or ATM leap calls \u200b Introduction Peloton was one of the key winners during the coronavirus pandemic and has seen a recent hit to its stock price as the world reopens and Wall Street starts to bet against the company as things \u2018return to normal.\u2019 In this DD, I would explain that Peloton is more than just a company that sells expensive workout equipment to stuck-at-home upper-middle-class housewives. Instead, it is more akin to a combination of a digital based subscription service and a fitness focused social media company. All of this, along with some external factors, once taken into account, will let Peloton carve out a key position in the broad fitness market even after Covid which in turn will translate into a higher stock price. \u200b Trend Towards Home Gyms Peloton was one of the companies that did exceptionally well during the pandemic as millions of Americans hunkered down and bought at-home fitness equipment. However, the mainstream mindset is that as things reopen and we transition \u201cback to normal\u201d many of these Americans will return to their old habits of going back to physical gym locations and as a result, Peloton will see significant headwinds to future growth. I do not believe this will be the case. I believe that despite gyms reopening, recent trends point to a permanent change in consumer behavior that not enough Wall Street analysts are talking about. Let me explain. First off, despite gyms being reopened, studies have actually shown that a staggering 60% of adults enjoyed their at-home equipment so much, they do not plan on going back to physical gym locations (link| |Total Cost: |$3,088|$2,988| \u200b This shows that just by assuming a person goes to a spin class twice a week, they can save around $600 in the first year by purchasing a Peloton. If that individual has a personal trainer, then the saving costs can be even larger. \u200b The Highly Addictive Atmosphere One unique aspect I keep hearing from Peloton users is how addictive the bikes are. Although the idea that working out and sweating can be addictive sounds absurd at face value, one look into the Peloton ecosystem can show us why that can be the case. When you read the testimonials and reviews of Peloton one thing that will often pop up is how engaging the classes are. The reviewers will often state that although they are working from home, the Peloton coaches, the music, and the overall environment of the classes make them feel like they are in a personal spin class or with a personal trainer one on one. Because of this, plus the social media aspects of the app such as competing against your fellow classmates make Peloton classes a highly addictive environment for many of its users. ( To drive this point home from another angle that is not anecdotal, you can actually see the engagement percentage on peloton\u2019s website. Right now the yearly engagement is around 94% yearly. This means that 94% of people who bought the Peloton bike still subscribes to the $49 monthly subscription 1 year after purchase. This is a big deal because Peloton does not make money selling bikes, they make money selling subscriptions as I will show you in the next section. \u200b A Look Into Their Financials When I analyze the financial statement of a company, I first focus on their balance sheet, income statement, then their cash flow. I also focus on convertible stocks, warrants, or any other investment vehicles that will let insiders or any other interested parties sell their shares and dilute shareholder value. Balance Sheet Balance sheet is useful in getting a quick snapshot into the overall health of the company. Here I will look at their working capital to confirm that the company is indeed solvent. \u200b Net working capital is the sum of current assets minus current liabilities. Since current assets outweigh current liabilities, the company\u2019s solvency is not an issue. Total assets outweigh total liabilities as well so the longevity of the company will not come into question. Income Statement For the income statement, three interesting things points out. First, is that the lion\u2019s share of company revenue comes from sale of fitness equipment and no the application subscription. This is not surprising but it confirms where top line revenue growth is coming from. The second point of interest is that in the operating expenses section the company invests heavily into marketing and R&D. R&D tripled compared to this time last year which means the company will most likely increase their product lines. SGA remains relatively steady which shows the company\u2019s management runs a tight ship and knows how to trim the fat around excess spending. This is a good sign especially for a growing tech company and it shows in their positive net income for the 9 months ended period in the third column. \u200b Another point of interest about their income statement is that even though subscription revenue accounts for about 16% of total revenue, it accounts for about 34% of gross profit. What this means is that Peloton does not make money selling the bikes, they make money via their subscription fees. The bikes are more so a tool to hook people in to the Peloton ecosystem where the real margins are made. Cash Flow Cash flow statements are broken into three sections: Operating, Investing, and Financing. Operating cash flow is useful for assessing the quality of the company\u2019s earnings. If a company posts positive EPS, they should also post positive operating cash flow as well. Over here you can see the company is operating cash flow positive which is really good because it shows high earnings quality as well as the company\u2019s ability to bring in cash to the business. This means the operations are actually viable and decreases the chance for future share and debt issuance which will erode current shareholder value. \u200b Investing cash flow is useful to assess where the company is investing their money and it gives good indication on where the management wants to take the company. \u200b What stands out to me the most in this section is the first line-purchases of marketable securities of -$450m. What this means is that this company is buying back $450m of their own shares per quarter which is really good because it increases the value of your stock holdings and elevates share price. This is a practice that is mostly attributed to blue chip companies so a growth stock like Peloton buying back shares is really impressive. What also stands out is that company increased their investment into PPE which shows that they are also invested into future growth which will really help long term potential. Financing cash flow is useful to see if the company is taking on too much debt relative to earnings and if the company is either financing their operations through debt or equity issuance. This section is important as a shareholder because it helps assess the value of your potential investment into the company. \u200b Over here you will see that this quarter the company did not issue out any convertible debt. This is a plus for current shareholders because it will help decrease the risk for future share dilution. This combined with their steady share buyback will help create a really positive outlook for this stock.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-07-02 01:10:55", "id": "obmn9v"}
{"text": "Okay, so I have had enough of missing out all these massive premarket plays, that end up going up 100's of percent up when market opens. Everyday I open my trading app, only to find some stock that has gone up 150% in a matter of minutes. There has to be a statistical way to catch these. Now I want to present to you this wonderful options strategy, known as the straddle. Now, for most of you retards this is going to be more complex than your smooth brain can handle, but I assure you, I'm gonna lay this out as simply as possible. A straddle essentially involves buying a put and call of the same quantity ATM. This way you are looking to make bank on volatility, since the movement of the options is cancelled out (the strategy is delta neutral). Now, why not just buy naked calls/puts you ask, because this is the tradition among retards on this subreddit. Well, that's because with naked puts/calls you have to actually predict which way the underlying instrument goes. With a straddle you don't. It moves up bigly, you make money. It moves down bigly, you make money. As long as it doesn't hover around the same ATM strike (usually within 2% of each direction, but this depends on IV and a bunch of other factors) you are gonna make money. This is what a straddle profit/loss graph looks like: ( \u200b The one thing that is setting all these plays apart, is massive volume in the premarket. We are talking volume that is sometimes 100-200% higher than average volume. This usually already causes a jump in the stock price. Now in order to actually profit of this strategy, one actually has to know the percentage of these plays that go on to have massive moves during market open, and also what this average move is. I haven't back tested this, hence I don't have this info, because I don't really know how. If someone could suggest how to do this, id be willing to analyse the data. Hence this is what I propose. Note, this is not going to work for all stocks, as some of these stocks are relatively unknown, and have no options contracts issued on them. Step by step guide: 1. In the premarket use FINVIZ to scan for unusual volume activity. You want liquid stocks. So I suggest setting the average volume to 1million, current volume to 2 million and the most important part, relative volume to above 3. The relative volume is crucial, because this is what measures current volume compared to average volume. The higher this number the better, since the further the current volume is from average volume. 2. Once you find a stock you that meets the above criteria, check the company out. Was there news? No news usually means smth is up, and this is prolly gonna moon/crash. It means someone knows smth you dont, and there is a market inefficiency which you can exploit. Also, check the company is actually worth smth, and not one of those Chinese shell companies that are a complete scam. 3. Before market opens, check option availability. If options are available you are in luck. Construct the straddle, and have a look at ( how much you need the stock to move to make money. You can construct a straddle using the 2 legged option. Note, the price of the straddle and most of this info is going to be different when market opens, because massive volume means that IV will change, and usually if the price has moved to, the options will be priced slightly differently too. This step is just to give you a rough idea of what you can expect. 4. Place the order before market opens, and pray for the best, so that your trade is executed at open. You can wait and see what happens at open, and see what actually happens to your straddle price, or you can be a real wsb retard and just yolo like a real ape, and just go in blind. Now, I am not a financial advisor, im just an Economics student, and a fellow ape. Dont take this to be financial advice, Im merely speculating here, and I wanna know whats wrong with this strat, because it seems to simple to be any good. I wanna know what you retards think. Is this completely stupid or can it be refined to actually be worth a second look? \u200b Edit: In step one, you can remove the current volume of 2 million, since you are already filtering by relative volume which accounts for at least 3 time average.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-07-14 18:59:01", "id": "ojznqe"}

Just the fact that microsoft is looking to partner with pltr means that not even they can do what pltr does. Thats a pretty big statement coming from the largest software company in the world. With most of the fortune 500 companies using microsoft cloud, i think it only a matter of time before pltr starts reeling in regular contract through this partnership. Quite from job post, \u201cYou will define and implement business development strategies with Microsoft across the entire range of Palantir products and services while at times focusing on specific Industry vertical and very specific market sector. You\u2019ll define the solution strategy, build cross-functional teams, foster critical relationships with the partner ecosystems and showcase Palantir\u2019s technology to Microsoft sellers and their strategic enterprise customers. Additionally, you\u2019ll partner with Product, Legal, Compliance and Enablement teams to ensure success of the channel and will work to leverage your experience to transform large organizations with Palantir Technologies. Join us as we lead the democratization of data to solve our customer\u2019s hardest problems!\u201d What really gets me there is that whoever gets this role will be showcasing pltr products to not only microsoft, but Microsoft\u2019s customers as well. This can only mean that pltr will probably shit itself especially if this news is announced. Great buying opportunity rn after the cathy wood sell off scare even tho she sold less than three percent of her holdings in pltr.

Most of the naked short positions were instituted by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse. 6 weeks ago Discovery's short position was 58 million. The CEO of Discovery sold the great American country network for an undisclosed sum of money which will increase their revenues on August 6th. Like clockwork Discovery stock always moves up in July because of shark week and the added impetus they have with the exclusive rights to the Olympics in Europe. Methodically Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are reducing their naked short positions of Discovery. The CEO of Discovery is making the right moves to increase revenue shareholder value with the merger of Warner Brothers. On August 6th Discovery incorporated will exceed not only their revenue but their earnings per share.

{"text": "Here is the post for reference of the sale of your home but you are just fine with paying 15%/20% taxes on a long-term sale or up to 37% taxes on a short term sale to a government that just pisses away our tax dollars..? I believe you have the gun pointed at the wrong people here first off.... Now back to that 6%. Since the OP of the post I'm referencing is obviously very ignorant to the profession they are attempting to condemn, let me shine some light on how this shit works. No Realtor ever sees that full 6%. Ever. Let me try to smooth-brain this for you: When you list your home with a Realtor and agree to pay the 6% commission, once that house sells that 6% gets split 4 ways. Yup. 4 ways. 3% gets SPLIT between the listing brokerage and the agent who actually listed the home (how did you think brokerages make money and stay open..?) and the other 3% gets SPLIT between the buyer's agent and that agent's brokerage. Since most of these splits are commonly 50/50 (there are certainly areas of our nation where the split is even less favorable to the agent), the agent who you're trying to bitch about getting 6% is actually getting roughly 1.5% once all the money is divided up. So to sum this up, when you pay 6% on the sale of your home, your money is not going to one person's pocket and making them mega-rich like everyone apparently thinks. Your money is helping to keep 2 separate businesses running and also helping two individuals pay their bills. And don't even get me started about the monopoly Zillow is attempting to run so they can control the prices of our housing market nationwide. Zillow (who owns Trulia, DotLoop, HotPads, Buyfolio, ShowingTime, Postlets, Diverse Solutions, RentJuice, Mortech, StreetEasy, Retsly, Naked Apartments, & Bridge Interactive) is a growing cancer attempting to not only oust Realtors, but Mortgage Lenders and Property Managers as well nationwide. Stop being so ignorant about this profession before your blind ignorance comes back to haunt you. And thank a Realtor the next time you see one. EDIT: No one is making you use a Realtor at the end of the day, so for those of you who feel they aren't worth a damn, just don't use one. But I made this post in defense of Realtors from being bashed and misunderstood as people who take all your money and do nothing since everyone seems to think they pocket the full 6%. That is a lie. Anyone is free to list their house on their own, and of course you're free to use Zillow or any other platform to assist you, just keep in mind this silver lining: When you choose to use Zillow, they aren't legally bound to provide you accurate information. They have disclaimers galore that keep them from being responsible when you make a stupid decision based on the info they provide. A Realtor has skin in the game; they are legally bound to provide nothing but accurate info and if they don't they can be sued. But go ahead, give up your right to have someone assist you that has skin in the game and go for the companies that could give a shit less if you just made the biggest financial mistake of your life off inaccurate info they provided you. EDIT 2: I am not a Realtor. I did obtain my license for my own personal gain, but I hate people too much to do what Realtors do daily.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-07-18 05:52:57", "id": "oma9s6"}

Nowadays it's opposite, and in fact a dental treatment is a fuckin fortune. If i knew initially how much that fuckin orthodontist would've charged me, i honestly would've considered to skip the treatment and use that money for $CLOV weeklies, but yeah, that's that. The point is, you need the insurance more than you think. # Great Catalysts 1. Currently CLOV is operating in 8 states. That means there is much more room for expansion. Recently Senate Democrats agreed to a $3.5 trillion budget \\- ratings: Over the last month $CLOV got two new ratings from research firms.

Regardless, insiders have been buying over the last few months and steel prices are not cooling anytime soon. China and any tariff talks are not going to take place in 2021, Biden's too busy with the Rona and unvacinated Karens.

{"text": "I agree that GME is getting close for a rip. From a TA perspective, its trading in a high volume area. When I look at GME from a weekly time frame, Money Flow has been increasing over the last 4 weeks, this usually tells me its under accumulation. I saw this move in AMZN before it ripped. But as we all know, It is very difficult to time a move. Since Options dictate a lot of moves, I like to take look at how MM's are positioned with GEX or known as Gamma Exposure. Gamma Exposure is really good if you like to sell options overall as it can provide information where Gamma Walls are at. Also can use it to know when to take profits. For example, on $DIS there is a Call Gamma Wall at 185. On Monday I took some profits on my calls since it is close to that PT. Now back to GME. We are currently in neg gamma territory and under a put wall at 170. If we cant close above this tomorrow, we could see 150 imo, the next high neg gamma area which I believe should provide good support. But you can also see, a close over 200, Call Gamma Wall, can make it fly with little resistance above. The screen shot is Gamma Exposure for the next 10 days.

{"text": "Good Afternoon Gents, I know many of you (at least my fellow Americans) are gearing up for fireworks, brats, and beer on the forth. I am too. So much so that by the end of writing this DD my brain had started to \"phone it in\" and I couldn't come up with a clever title...I need a vacation. Moving on. This is my third company DD, and my goal (as always) is to provide you will all the info I have so you can make your own EDUCATED decisions. THAT MEANS do not just take my word for any of this. I suggest you all \u201ctrust but verify\u201d. As with all my DD\u2019s, I\u2019m not going to talk about short interest (SI) because you should invest in companies for better reasons (my personal opinion). Additionally, most shorts aren\u2019t naked, so SI doesn\u2019t paint a good picture of whether or not a squeeze could occur. \\--------- # Commercial Metals Company ($CMC) Background Commercial Metals Company manufactures, recycles, and fabricates steel and metal products utilizing electric arc furnace (\"EAF\") mini mills, EAF micro mills, rerolling mills, steel fabrication and processing plants, construction-related product warehouses, and metal recycling facilities in the U.S. and Poland. \\--------- Fundamentals and Recent Accomplishments/Developments: THEY JUST KEEP BEATING EARNINGS. They have also been increasing over the past 3 quarters. Despite this, it seems the market hasn't reacted and the price of CMC has been trading relatively flat to down since the latest blowout earnings. P/E=11.29 (low relative to DIA which is between 19.8 and 22.6) Debt/Eq = 0.5 (very very low, stable company) CMC leads in the markets that they are in. The following info is from the 2021 3rd quarter earnings presentation here: Link 1. CMC\u2019s stability of in their construction backlog and willingness of downstream customers in North America to contract new work point to continued demand strength. The CEO stated that \u201cThis view is supported by several widely monitored construction indicators that generally lead activity by nine to twelve months, which have improved significantly in 2021,\u201d. \\------------- Biden Infrastructure Plan On June 24th President Joe Biden declared \u201cwe have a deal\u201d on a major infrastructure initiative after meeting with a bipartisan group of senators. The deal will pump $1.2 trillion into roads, bridges, tunnels and broadband. These are the markets that CMC services primarily (minus broadband). Biden has delinked the infrastructure bill from some additional Democratic plans. This move gained support from Republicans and has increased the likelihood that the infrastructure bill will pass. Once passed, CMC could benefit greatly from government contracts. \\------------- # Technical Analysis: Bottom of a rising channel. Price target $37. Could also be a double bottom if it hits 30 again which would be really bullish., the company has no debt. They produce something that everyone needs. That thing is steel. Steel costs a lot of money and will continue to into the foreseeable future. The CME group bumped hot-rolled coil (HRC) steel futures to over $1000 out till Jan 2023 (previously Dec 2022). HRC futures for the near-term months are continuing to climb above $1800, and my personal conversations with Civil Engineers indicate that clients are still begging to build new structures regardless of the material costs. CMC doesn\u2019t produce HRC, however I THINK the price of rebar (and steel in general) tends to track with the price of HRC. \u200b Also, I really am starting to believe that some semblance of an infrastructure bill will get pushed through. Downside: CMC doesn\u2019t service the US automotive industry and shouldn\u2019t see much benefits from the easing of the semiconductor shortage. Thanks for reading. Cheers, Old\\_Prospect \"The men who have succeeded are men who have chosen one line and stuck to it.\" - Some Rich Asshole \\---------------- # Positions: All calls. Volatility is low. 10 Calls, $28 strike, 9/17 exp 5 Calls, $30 strike, 9/17 exp TL;DR \u2013 Another steel play of mine. Seems like an obvious winner here.

{"text": "(I created this DD early last week for WSB but NEGG started to moon and I lost interest in finishing it. However, people seemed to like it when I shared the google doc, so I'm posting it here. ) Shout out to u/GhostOfGregDoucette for helping me with this research \\----------- Back in October 2020 Newegg, an online retailer that mostly sells electronics, announced it is going to go public back in a \"reverse merger\" with LLIT in some time in Q1 of 2021, which we now know closed on May 20, 2021, and 1,513,889 as Class B. As of the filling of this form (May 12 2021) there were 3,465,683 common shares outstanding. The float directly offered to the public is 2,729,755 out of the 3,465,683 and the float that the underwriter owns is around 735,928. Unsure about the chinese risk F-1 & edgar forms getting hard to read only sure about float ---to be continue See below for a summary of the offering \u200b Shout out to u/GhostOfGregDoucette for figuring out the float was funky # When does lockup end? Well according to the SEC form that summarizes the investors rights (link from the SEC\u2019s website. Go back to the FTD graph search for $SENS, the peak of \\ \\FTD as a percentage of Float\\ almost exactly lines up\\. Let\u2019s try another one, $GME. \u200b Peak of average loan age at Jan 25 2021 of 85days, placing the date on Nov 25th, the FTD graph shows this as well. Ok, last one let\u2019s check $UWMC \u200b $UWMC had a peak of avg loan age on Jun 10th, subtract 41days from that day and you get April 29th lining up pretty well with $UWMC largest FTD spike. Ok so I\u2019m basically saying that for stocks without data on ortex you can get a sense of where the shorts have opened positions by looking at the peaks of ftds. I only checked stocks with relatively large peaks as a percentage of float idk about others. So basically for $NEGG there has been a considerable amount of short positions opened May 15 - Jun 15, these guys are underwater. Next notice that GME FTD spike wasn\u2019t the day that the tendie god turned on the money printer that magical January, it was actually in November. Every stock that has reach GME level of \\FTD % of Float\\ moons later, the spike never really lines up with the dildo to heaven. It could happen a week later, months later, days later, but it seems that for the outliers its going to happen. $NEGG is in the middle of a squeeze and its FTD spike rival stocks that have gone +200 to +400% during the moonshot. The smaller the float and the higher the spike, the more the pop. I haven\u2019t quantified this. If you checked interactive brokers during the day you would have noticed that $NEGG had 0 shares available to short, and the borrow rate is >50%. At peak squeeze borrow rate usually spikes >100%. Lastly, in the last two days the short volume ratio has gone up by a factors & volume has gone up as well \u200b One thing I failed to mention is that the stock is already expensive to buy -- $20 -- ensuring that doubling down on shorting requires substantial capital. Looking at iborrowdesk.com we see that nice juicy slow creep up of borrow rate, and reduction of shares available to borrow, while the price slow bleeds up. So $negg is expensive to double down on and it expensive to borrow. Now look at your fave stock that has squeezed borrow rate > 100% rn $negg borrow is a moderate \\. So basically what I\u2019m saying is that $NEGG is in the beginning to mid part of a squeeze. Not a squeeze perpetuated by a hardened group of loyalist and propelled by whales. A squeeze caused by a Not financial advice in anyway. I love Newegg as a company, and I'm freaking amped that they're public, so full disclosure, I've got biases. That being said, I think it's a solid buy. It seems only one analyst has really put a price target on it. I don't know who the analyst is, but any google search for a price target pings back the same, beautiful, 44$ prediction, spread across all of our favorite market commentators. (WSJ, Market Watch, Yahoo) If that's not enough to get you excited, we go to their financials. In 2016 they made a measly 13M$. 2017 came around, and they made an abysmal 1M$. 2018, though? 2.15B$. Mind you, they went from making 1Million dollars... to 2.1 BBillion. 2019, and 2020 were both in the 2 Billion dollar range. (Via WSJ) And now? GPU prices are inflated to high hell, son! Despite that, Newegg seems to be able to Earnings announcement is going to be fantastic! Lastly, let's take a look at technicals. Yesterday and the day before, NEGG had a huge run up! Literally having doubled its price at one point. (Ran from 10$ to 21$ before coming back down.) In that time, it showed strong support at 13. I thought we might see 13$ again today. Besides that, it showed support yesterday, at it's first dip, at 15$, bounced from there up to 19.5, before getting rejected. After it's rejection, it showed support at 16.75 for AH/PM, at 15.75$ for the intraday low. AND THEN IT BOUNCED BACK TO 17.75! If we break down under 15$, We might see 13$, again. Right now, it's gearing up to retest 21$. A rejection from that will likely put us back in this 17.75 range. If we break that 21$ resistance? Then we might get a test of 22$. We might see another gamma squeeze as brokers start hedging for the 22.5$ Calls. (btw he\u2019s off about the gamma sqz; options just got introduced, everything else is interesting) It also has some recent good news: [ # Positions \u200b \u200b I\u2019m risky af probably better positions out there, took out 20k yesterday (Jul 6, 2021), positions above are as of of pre-market July 7. The 13 $30 calls bought Jul 6, 2021for about $3 a pop, end of day they were $6.3, high of $8.1. Don\u2019t think i\u2019ve said this, but I believe legit $NEGG is a money printer. # Advice Taken from u/Fatinspiration Don\u2019t sell on dips. You\u2019re only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when it\u2019s heading up. Sell high, not low, retards. Don\u2019t buy calls on rips.

{"text": "Desktop Metal, Inc. (DM) First things first: Desktop Metal is a speculative buy that\u2019s based on a macro industry movement called the Industrial Revolution 4.0. If you\u2019re looking for a stock with strong earnings, PE ratios, and a history of revenue growth kindly fuck off on outta here. If you\u2019re looking for the next potential Carnegie Steel, this is about to blow your mind. Desktop Metal is positioned to be a once in a generation type of company. Additive Manufacturing is a major part of Industry 4.0 that will entirely flip manufacturing on its head. Before I dive into Desktop Metal and why we all need to be bullish on this particular company, let\u2019s briefly go back in time and take a quick history detour on how manufacturing got to where it is today and why additive manufacturing is the next giant leap forward. This information is paramount to understanding where Desktop Metal is and where they\u2019re going relative to the industry backdrop. I will scatter some colorful and fun photos to help digest the information: \u200b ### There are three major groups of manufacturing: Subtractive - Prior to the industrial revolution, subtractive manufacturing was the primary way products were produced. Subtractive manufacturing is the process where parts of a block of material are removed until the desired outcome is created. Imagine you\u2019re manufacturing something like a high-end violin. You would start with a block of wood from a spruce tree from the corner of the Italian Alps in the Fiemme valley and start carving away at it until you end up with violin-shaped parts. There\u2019s a lot of waste and it takes a lot of time to carve out. Today, this process has been fully automated and produces highly refined products that can withstand long-term and high-stress usage. However, there\u2019s still a lot of waste and the process takes a set amount of time per unit of output. Forming - This is one of the most common processes for mass manufacturing today. A mold is created of the final product that is looking to be produced and that mold is filled by injection with the material, which then cools, hardens, and takes on the form of the mold design. This process is used for everything from metal products, plastics, glass as well as a variety of other materials. The major advantage of this process is the ability to produce thousands of identical parts at a low cost per unit. However, the downside is that injection molding is costly in terms of the time and money it takes to develop the mold. Once completed, making any changes requires an entirely new mold. Additive - Additive manufacturing means the products are created by adding layer after layer. There are 7 main types of additive manufacturing, and Desktop Metal specializes in carbon fiber and metal manufacturing. The main benefits of additive manufacturing are: Speed: Companies can now build prototypes and innovate faster than ever. Rather than using traditional means of manufacturing, with 3D printing companies, they are able to test their ideas in real time and make changes faster than ever. By doing this, companies can rapidly increase the speed at which they bring new ideas to market and quickly validate/invalidate ideas. Cost: Compared with traditional means of manufacturing, the cost of printing objects is significantly cheaper and more efficient. Layer in the saved labor costs and the cost of innovating and scaling products can now be cheaper than ever! Quality: During the manufacturing process, errors can easily be introduced that get amplified and can lead to catastrophic consequences. With 3D printing, you remove all of the manor labor and introduce new efficiencies that make products not only higher quality, but safer too! Sustainability: Similar to the above, traditional manufacturing creates significant waste which can be improved via 3D printing. With also fewer parts, and more efficient designs, less energy is used too, creating a more sustainable, healthier and cheaper product. ### Focusing on Additive Manufacturing: The technology for additive manufacturing started in the 1980\u2019s and was primarily used for prototyping. As it evolved, 3D printing transitioned into creating molds and tools for traditional manufacturing. In the last few decades, additive manufacturing has gone more mainstream to produce end-use parts. 3D printing is an innovative technology that lets you create a physical object from a digital model. All you need to do is make a design, transfer the file to a 3D printer, then bring your object to life. (Let's print a LAMBO!) Once printed, the 3D printer produces layers of material, one on top of the other. This forms the finished object. So, for example, instead of manufacturing traditional hardware, 3D printers can recreate the same finished products by designing it on a computer and just clicking print! Think of it similar to a traditional printer but instead of 2-dimensional, it is 3-dimensional, and can use other materials (not just ink - it can use metal, graphite, etc.)! The industry is expected to grow 11x over the next decade from $12 billion in 2020 to $146 billion in 2030. \u200b # History lesson is over... FF to the inception of Desktop Metal Desktop Metal was founded half a decade ago in Boston. Their initial product was to develop a metal-printing 3D printer that could be small enough to operate within an office environment. Today, they have four products in its portfolio: Fiber, Studio System, Shop System and Production system. The Studio, Shop, and Production products support both the printing of both metals as well as fiber composites such as Carbon Fiber. DM\u2019s flagship product is their Production system, built from the ground up to be the fastest 3D production printer in the industry at 100x the speed of laser based systems while keeping a consistent quality. They\u2019ve pioneered a precise and rapid process to accomplish this speed through the following: DM\u2019s Production system has developed a more efficient process for the powder processing unit. The unit\u2019s job is to deliver consistent metal powder across the printer and other systems do this by starting with a pile of material and then spreading it out across the print bed. DM meters out a constant rate of spread that\u2019s dispensed and then compacted to produce the final print layer. \u200b Once the powder is placed on the print bed, an anti-ballistic system to control powder as a binder is sprayed on top to prevent the powder from dirtying the print heads. This is where the geometry of each layer is created and it\u2019s repeated layer by layer. \u200b \u200b This process is made more efficient by developing an entire box full of parts at the same time and it\u2019s capable of supporting multiple stacks of parts. The next step is called cross linking. The build box is put into an oven to activate the binder and creates the parts. At this stage, the parts are still in powdered metal form, but are strong enough to handle and move to the next stage called depowdering and centering. This is where the parts are put into an industrial oven and the powdered metal is heated until it forms a solid piece of metal in the shape of the final product itself. \u200b Speed is only half the battle, consistency is the other half. DM\u2019s prints with the most advanced industrial print heads available on the market at 1200 DPI and has a proprietary camera system that images every layer of every bed with two different angles of light to detect defects. If any problems are encountered, it\u2019s automatically flagged and the operator is notified. Another major advantage of DM that was incorporated from the ground up is that it uses an open powder system. What that means is a customer can use their own powders from traditional supply chains directly with DM\u2019s production system. This open powder system means customer\u2019s can develop a process that works for their business and the Production system can be adapted to fit. To make implementation even easier, DM produced a smaller R&D machine that uses the exact same software and steps to help businesses design a process, develop their product, and be able to quickly transition from R&D to full production. The production system allows customers to do things that just wasn\u2019t feasible previously. From a time and money perspective, it\u2019s able to be highly competitive with traditional manufacturing methods, a feat that has previously not been possible in the additive manufacturing industry for metals and carbon fiber. This means that all of the benefits of additive manufacturing, the designs that are possible, as well as rapid iterations on the production are all now possible with DM\u2019s Production system. A major advantage for businesses is additive manufacturing\u2019s capability to combine the number of parts needed to develop a single component. An example of this is back in 2016, Airbus was able to produce it\u2019s fuel nozzles for it\u2019s engines using additive manufacturing and reduce the number of parts from 20 to 1. This reduced the components weight by 25% (incredibly important for the airline industry) and reduced the assembly time. \u200b On top of their hardware, Desktop Metal has pioneered an industry-leading AI-driven software for designing and modeling. This complementary SaaS product, along with secondary products like their printing cartridges, Desktop Metal\u2019s business model positions them well to bring customers in and have a consistent revenue stream for years to come. Today, Desktop Metal is one of the fastest growing unicorns in US history. Their 2020 revenue of 16.5 million USD is tiny compared to their valuation, but their growth has been tremendous. They only began shipping their Shop System and Production System in Q4 of 2020. Q3 of 2020 was reported at $2.5 million and rose to $8.4 million in Q4, a 236% increase. The company\u2019s aggressive expansion strategy positions it well to take advantage of the growth opportunities that lie ahead. It\u2019s projected to be around $1 billion in revenue by 2025, a 87% CAGR. As of now, the company has 90+ production systems on reservation, which means that they\u2019re sold out until the first half of 2024! Compared to their peers in the space, Desktop Metal as a stock can be considered relatively cheap and underpriced. With no outstanding debt and $600M+ on it\u2019s balance sheet, there\u2019s a wide cushion for the business to operate over the next few years to accelerate its growth and capture market share. This large balance sheet, something unheard of for a company of their size, gives them an unfair competitive advantage in the industry. This is just another one of many reasons Desktop Metal is poised to outperform over the long term. On top of their existing suite of products, Desktop Metal has an aggressive strategy for mergers and acquisitions. They\u2019ve already identified $2 billion of revenue across 60+ potential targets, with 10 of them in contact and under analysis. \u200b Who else has skin in the game? Over the last few years, institutional money has been rapidly coming into Desktop Metal with over 2/3rd of the institutional investors increasing their positions. Many of the big players are seeing the same trends and have begun taking a position within companies in the 3D printing space. Desktop Metal happens to be well positioned and from our analysis, underpriced for the time being. Some of the biggest and most innovative investors such as Aunt Cathie Woods at Ark Invest, Papa Chamath, and Google Ventures are currently holding positions within Desktop Metal. KEY TAKEAWAYS Desktop Metal\u2019s high quality products are positioned to ride the rising wave of the fourth industrial revolution! Industry leading technology platform. Massive and rapidly growing addressable market. DM\u2019s production system provides better value for certain applications, which opens up multiple industries to the benefits of additive manufacturing at a comparable cost and time efficiency. Desktop Metal is a stock that has the potential to 10x or more in the next few years. It has an incredibly talented team helming the ship, a backlog of sales for the next 3 years, an aggressive M&A plan in place to continue to fuel its growth, and thus is well positioned in the market to capture the industrial revolution 4.0 wave. And not only do they have the opportunity to execute, they're proving they can. Let's take a look at the numbers: 2025 expected revenue $950M (represents over 100% YoY revenue growth relative to where they are today) * 2025 expected EBITDA is $260M (representing net margins of 27%) THIS IS UNHEARD OF FOR TRADITIONAL MANUFACTURING! Looking across their \"competition\" we all can see margins in the single digits and YoY growth in the single digits too. What this tells me is that DM is in a unique position to take significant market share from legacy players. When we see dynamic shifts like this unfolding, this becomes massive opportunities for us to partake in! While there are obvious risks (new entrants, anti-competitive practices, new laws, etc.) I am going long and hard with Desktop Metal.

The internet hasn't had its equivalent of a world war or nuclear threat yet. Most investors don't even think much about security.

{"text": "Greetings retards, autists and apes. Here to share my outlook and some very simple TA in way too many words that you don't know how to read which may have already been invalidated in after hours trading with the vanilla NFLX news. This is a fictional account and not investment advice. # Preface Today is Wednesday July 14th, 2021. As you can see, GME has been selling off on very low volume and really accelerated today, along with many other caca stocks that are starting to make their way back down to hell after a nice consolation bounce out of the May lows. Many will break May lows and never recover, FYI. GME is special, though, as it is the Queen of caca stocks standing steadfast beside King TSLA who retired from greatness after the SPX add and has a date with 400. For both, many would say they are not caca and have fundamental upside. Maybe they do, maybe they don't. What we do know is GME low float, high SI and is subject to gamma squeezes (helped by short covering) and that is what we are looking for come August to September as we watch for a pattern to repeat itself. # Where we are at Today just before close, GME found a potential bottom at 165 with huge volume which is peculiarly right where we have several supports: 7) The positive trendline running from the extremely bullish engulfing candle just after the earnings gap down in March to the beginning of the breakout in May heading into Q2 ER. 2) The all-time-highs AVWAP which basically encapsulates the average of volume and price since the day GME sent Gabe home crying. Like moving averages, above is bullish ( \ud83d\ude80 ) and below it is bearish (\ud83c\udf08). 4) Thicc volume shelves from $100-150 where most volume has traded since January, indicating where traders have been interested in buying in the past, and where those who sold at highs or missed the boat the first time may find value in entering. 6) 151 is a pivotal level related to some gamma/greek mysticism. As we saw after hours today, price hit 151.01 and bounced for 9 pts. Below 151 is certain death, or possibly a 200-day MA test around 110 (orange line) Not only are we at these multiple, coinciding levels of support, we are in the midst of oversold territory with daily RSI at 33, its lowest reading since before most of you were born (April 3, 2020, $2.80 close). An aside: What a long way GME has come to be knocking at the year-to-date RSI lows and closing at almost $168, OG GME bull /u/Uberkikz11 and the GMEdd team's bull case fair value target released on 1/20/21. Market weighing machine well at work. Cheers, Rod. But wait! There's more: While GME is in oversold territory, SPX and especially NQ/FAGMAN are well overbought and starting to show weakness here at monthly OpEx with AAPL now carrying all of the weight. We've seen money flow to the safe haven of GME in times of hedging need. Should the indexes pull back starting as soon as tomorrow (Thursday 7/15) or sometime next week, the money that was made dumping tech on retail at ATHs will find its way somewhere, and in the past it has been GME (and boomer value stocks). Watch AAPL weakness for clues. All this being said, today I would put us at or around 3/24 in the quarterly cycle. Especially with the NFLX news knocking us down even lower into oversold territory with support at 151, our capitulation may be in. # Where we are going All these factors are indicating that, should patterns repeat, GME is ripe for a bounce in the near future, and it could be a nice 40-60 pt ripper up to resistance levels at the 20 or 50 day MAs around 200, or one of the other two swing high AVWAPs above (207, 235). At the very least, from the after hours action we will open gapped-down with gap to fill at 167. Could fill now, could fill next week, could fill never. Now, I don't think we are going to see a breakout with continuation until we get to mid August, for another \\~4 week run up into earnings. As you can see between Q1-Q2 ER, we caught a 64 pt dragon dong oversold bounce out of the 3/24 capitulation candle, and after that came two months of consolidation where GME was pinned in a relatively tight range in order to let IV die down, cheapen OTM calls for large in scale buying, and let shorts get comfy enough to catch them off guard. # GamePlan Immediate term: Watch price action tomorrow AM for a rip out of open which dips may be bought, or a sell at open to re-test 151, followed by a reversal on increased volume if 151 holds and shit starts hitting the fan on NQ/SPX. If it doesn't reverse strongly but holds 151, look for basing to occur with more volume to come in possibly in the afternoon, eventually bringing volatile movements to the upside. The basing could take a while, might not start getting interesting until Friday afternoon into close. IF we don't get a strong reversal by end of this week, but hold 151, look for a dip-to-moon or rip straight out of the gates on Monday. Targets are the upper resistance levels 198, 209, 235. Don't be greedy. IF we lose 151, let it die some more. If you liked GME at 483, you'll love it in the low 100s. Don't try to catch the falling knife, you will get cut. Possible supports at 151, 137, 110, 48, 40. Wait for confirmation. Earnings play: Watch for price to consolidate for a few weeks after any bounce, identify the consolidation range and look for entries at the low end of the range around August OpEx 8/20. Sell into strength BEFORE earnings. # Footnotes Positions: 7/16 170c, 180c, 190c, 7/23 190c. Be realistic with OTM calls. 800c will not print. Obligatory rockets: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Disclaimer: This is for entertainment purposes only.

{"text": "You\u2019ve probably recently seen CLF on WSB, CNBC, and all over the place lately? Why is that\u2026? Because Steel is going fucking crazy right now, and CLF is ahead of the curve. So, what\u2019s the play? Why is it a play? How is it play? Buckle up boys: close out of porn hub, grab a beer, and prepare for your smooth brain to gain a half-wrinkle. You\u2019re going to be here a while. Let\u2019s start with the company, Cleveland Cliffs. This company is 174 fucking years old, employs 25,000 people, and it\u2019s traditionally been the largest and oldest independent iron ore mining company in the USA. They own or co-own five active iron ore mines in Minnesota and Michigan and maintain an annual rated iron ore production capacity of approximately 28.0 million long tons. Ok, so what? Who the fuck cares \u2013 mining and steel production isn\u2019t sexy, pink-haired septum pierced hippies hate it, and it\u2019s barely a blip on Wall Street\u2019s radar. Guess what- I care, and you should too. When evaluating a company, there are several dimensions to look at - the people and their long-term strategies behind the company are some of the most important. Let\u2019s go deeper. Cue in Lourenco Goncalves. This maniacal son of a bitch joined CLF seven years ago as CEO through a contested proxy battle and he\u2019s been transforming the company and telling Goldman Sachs analysts they are embarrassments to their parents ever since: Automotive 45 % Infrastructure and manufacturing 15 % Distributors and converters 13 % Steel producers 27 % Again, so fucking what? Why so many numbers? Who gives a shit, what does it mean? Guess what: I give a shit, and you should too. Here's what it means: \"The exacting requirements for servicing the automotive market generally allows for higher selling prices for products sold to that market than for the commodity types of carbon and stainless steels sold to other markets. As the only North American producer of high-efficiency NOES (Non-Oriented Electrical Steel), which is a critical component of H/EV motors, CLF is positioned to potentially benefit from the growth of H/EVs going forward. Likewise, the growing customer adoption of H/EVs may also increase demand for improvements in the electric grid to support higher demand for more extensive battery charging.\" For those who can\u2019t read good \u2013 the auto industry in particular needs precision requirements from steel inputs for safety and efficiency. This means CLF can charge higher prices for a more technical product and the players in the space are limited. Who do you think can spin up an iron ore mine, build a factory to roll steel, and sell it to the end customer? Nobody but the players already in the space. It would take Amazon at least 5 years to be ready to capitalize on this market (Mining permits, Ecological Studies, Building permits, Construction, Operational spin up, etc.) The players in the space are all that are it - and CLF just ate two of them. Ace the hole: Added onto this, the prices of steel have tripled, and there is no end in sight. Every month, pricing keeps going higher. This translates to pure tendies. This won\u2019t last forever, but damn\u2026 two good years of boosted profits is a hell of a tail wind coming right off of two huge ground shaking acquisitions. It\u2019s a great set-up and CLF is taking full advantage of it by paying down long-term debt, de-leveraging risk, and returning money to the shareholders (Goncalves words, not mine). Notice how I haven\u2019t even mentioned the trillion-dollar infrastructure bill yet \u2013 which happens to fall under at least 42% of CLF\u2019s revenue stream. I don\u2019t know enough about the bill to properly factor in what and how much of a benefit CLF may see from it, but it\u2019s not hard to imagine how a steel company would benefit from a $1T infrastructure spending spree. By now, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re holding that small, yet rock hard banana in your pants and you\u2019re already thinking of how you\u2019re going to tell your wife\u2019s boyfriend Axel that you don\u2019t need his weekly allowance anymore. Not so fast, we have more work to do. So, let\u2019s assume that CLF is undervalued. Let\u2019s assume that Wall Street is too focused on tech at the moment and overlooked this small, yet well-established and fast-growing steel maker in Ohio. Let\u2019s assume that steel prices will maintain their highs for another year. If CLF is undervalued, then what is it actually worth? JP Morgan thinks $39 UBS thinks $28 BofA thinks $25 Goldman Sachs thinks $20 (fuck Goldman) Right now, I\u2019m at $32.25 I\u2019ve combed through their financials, 10K\u2019s and most recent 10-Q after their Acquisitions to get the best numbers I can and come up and a price which I think is conservative. Disclaimer: I\u2019m not a professional \u2013 I believe my numbers are good, but not perfect. I could have missed something or multiple things, it\u2019s almost certain that I did. This isn't financial advice. My assumptions could be off and my estimates are approximations. If you see something that I missed, overlooked, or think that I'm retarded, please tell me and I'll revise it. My Main Assumptions: \\- Steel prices will continue roaring through end of this year, and maybe until Q3 of 2022. \\- CLF will use their profits to pay down long-term debt and finalize their newly acquired assets, which is what they have said they will do \\- Their new business operation will yield new efficiencies and synergies where they can lower their Cost of Goods Sold (historically around 75%). In my projections, I\u2019ve tweaked COGS to be a bit higher in the next couple of years to account for the overall chaos of two crazy big acquisitions, and due to the fact that the reason why the number has been so large in Q4 2020 and Q1 2021, was they were moving all of their new assets and steel inventories around the US, which translates to a lot of shipping cost because steel is heavy. \\- I\u2019m assuming that next year they will start to lower their inventories, which I believe are currently bloated from the acquisitions. \\- I did not factor in any other new broad sweeping strategy plays or acquisitions \\- Many of my projections are based on trend functions, averages, or general educated guesses. \\- \u201cHey wait a second, you show that CLF will only show $1.4 billion income for 2021, but they upgraded guidance to expect $5 billion this year\u201d. Correct, but that number shown in the pretty graph in the 10-k is \u201cAdjusted\u201d EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure. Nothing wrong with that, but I prefer to evaluate via GAAP and Un-Adjusted. \u200b ( \u200b ( \u200b \u200b ( \u200b ( \u200b Ok, let\u2019s re-cap \u2013 For the Apes: Ape Strong. Steel Strong. Ape and Steel Together Stronger For the Autists: An old washed-up mining company has transformed into an upgraded steel manufacturer that is ready to play in the big leagues with new assets, boat loads of fresh money, and very few analysts on Wall Street have priced it in. For the Retards: Buy high sell low. \u200b Ok, I'm jacked to the tits and ready to \"Invest\". What\u2019s the play? Looking at it from a TA perspective at daily candles, the steel sector has been ripping the last 6 months, creating an ascending triangle. What I see happening in the next month or two is another leg up \u2013 right into that $30 zone and maybe hit $35 by EoY depending on steel prices. CLF earnings are on 7/22, which I think there will be a run-up to, and/or the day of. Hard to say. In addition to that, Steel is a long play in and of itself. If you are risk-tolerant and want something short-term, play the earnings call. If you are more conservative \u2013 go for deep ITM LEAPS, which is what I\u2019ll be doing.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-07-03 00:36:07", "id": "oca8q2"}

{"text": "7.18 edit: This was posted a few days ago. At the time the premium was $ 5.00. As of today up to $8.80. WOOD dropped from $87.16 to $83.15. So far so good. Take a look at lumber futures. You will see on May 7th it was trading at $1686. Not the peak. Today trading at $580. This is basically at the July 2020 level. Inflation in lumber is transitory. Fortunately for us it takes around 90 days for the impact to be felt at the lumber mills and retail outlets. So if you go buy lumber today at home depot you are still paying at the $1686 price. However this is just starting to change. WOOD is a lumber ETF. On May 7tn the price was $96.75. Today at $87.16. One year ago trading at $60.00. You can see the etf has dropped but nowhere near the percentage lumber futures are dropping. That is the opportunity. The top 3 holdings on wood: Rayonier RYN. On may 7th was at $37.88. Today at $37.42. One year ago at $27.78. Weyerhaeuser. WY. . In May at $40. Today at $34.53. A year ago at 26.11 WEST FRAZER TIMBER. WFG. In May at $86.48. Now at $71. Year ago at $44.56. As you can see all these companies are trading at least 25 percent higher than they were a year ago. WOOD is trading at least 30 percent higher. Lumber companies are all getting ready to report earnings. Their numbers will look excellent. However based on the price of lumber dropping we will see them have to give guidance on future earnings. No way can these companies duplicate the record 2nd quarter. I expect to see downgrades and profit taking. Thus causing the price to dramatically drop. Position. PUTS on WOOD.

There is a chance China doesn't approve of it, but based on their past acquisition decisions I think it has a strong chance of being allowed. Then again, it's the Chinese government so who knows.

{"text": "Alright you retards, I'm taking the initiative to clear the air. I'm probably going to get a lot of downvotes, but I'm going to be straight up honest here. We are not a team, this is not a cult, and this is not fucking collusion. GME, AMC, & CLOV are three completely different plays. Stop fucking comparing the 3 with this cult like attitude. GME \\- Was being shorted because as per \"technicals\" it was a company that was going to shit (bankruptcy) if they didn't change leadership and incorporate strategic changes to their business model aka E-Commerce and the like. Additionally, the biggest reason GME picked up in late December/early January is because it had a ridiculous/unprecedented short interest of %140. Making the short squeeze extremely likely to occur. The stock picked up, gamma squeeze and short squeezes occurred and it's still the play to this day. Why? because the remaining \\~15-20% short sellers still holding their positions are the same ones from the beginning who have accumulated billions in loses, thus still considered a major play + the company making big changes to their board of directors, adding e-commerce and more etc. AMC \\- This stock sucked dick when it was first picked up. The only reason this stock got picked up was because of nostalgia and because of people missing out on GME. The SI% on AMC back when GME rallied up was well below 20%. This company as well was on the verge of bankruptcy. It got picked up by the supporters like us apes and more shorts loaded in. AMC due to the retail investors \"Picking\" this stock to rally up actually has started to work on their business model and accrued $1B in investments and has started to really concentrate on building the business into a success (hopefully). When the CEO said the talks of bankruptcy are no longer on the table, is because even they knew at the time that filing for bankruptcy was a real possibility for the company. Again, the CEO has fucked over investors in the past by trying to continually dilute the float with adding more shares. On top of that prior to the stocks rallying up the board and CEO's paid themselves handsomely when the company was about to fail. Now, the narrative is different for AMC as the shorts that are in this stock are the same ones from the beginning and have also accrued unrealized losses. Also, seems the company has really pivoted to reconstruct their business model to become a success once COVID-19 is no longer hindering the world from being normal again, thus, making AMC still a very big play. CLOV \\- Was ridiculously shorted the moment it hit IPO. This had nothing to do with GME or AMC. The short interest on CLOV has been there since IPO. The play for CLOV is that it's a Medicare Advantage Disruptor, and provides a real use case and a cost effective solution to the traditional Medicare Advantage sub-segment that hasn't changed in ages. This stock has a large short interest, now probably greater then AMC and GME combined, low float, no debt, and has a very bright future for growth. It's also heavily invested by Alphabet (Google) and other major players. The firms shorting CLOV are not the same as those who shorted GME and AMC, separate that from your minds. Yes, Melvin Capital, Citadel and others targeted GME and AMC, but this has no relevance to CLOV. No one gives a fuck, a viable stock that has a potential to disrupt a market segment that is also heavily shorted is the play for CLOV. That's it, simple as that. All 3 of these stocks are completely different plays. Yes, a short squeeze and/or gamma squeeze will always be appreciated on any stock. But get this through your heads, THEY ARE NOT THE SAME PLAY! They are completely different in respect to each other. WSB is a casino, we're here to place bets and hope for the best. This is not a team sport, this is not a cult, and this is not collusion. If you don't like a stock, then don't throw money at it. But stop with the shilling and the cult attitude predominantly from GME and AMC diehards that can't grasp that WSB is a casino and not a subreddit solely about GME or AMC. (I'm not talking about GME and AMC holders as a whole, most of you are chill af, just some that are constantly shilling everything with a ticker thats not GME or AMC). Now with this shit said, I'm a big supporter of all 3. But for fuck sakes they are not the same play, stop comparing the 3. Don't forget AMC dropped to $6 and AMC bagholders were bag holding for months before it moved. GME dropped to $40 and GME holders were bag holding for months before it moved. Everyone needs to chill the fuck out, play your plays and keep it moving. Stop shilling shit and comparing shit when they're not correlated at all. BB and NOK became \"Meme\" stocks because fundamentally, they were undervalued for what the company actually does and where they're positioning themselves for the future. People just need to stop comparing and having these debates. 3 stocks, 3 completely different plays, fuck off and throw your money at which ever stocks you like and hope for the best, just stop with the comparisons and cult shit it's ridiculous. Also, the short squeeze is nowhere near in sight. You think the short sellers are dumb as fuck? They're going to wait until inflation hits and fucks up the whole market. They're probably betting that once the market goes tits up, people bag holding these stocks will sell, why? Because they anticipate people will need to pay for bills, mortgages/rent, their children etc, and with the cost of living, cost of commodities inflating due to inflation, I can easily see how they're going to hold onto their positions (shorting these stocks) until this occurs. They're banking that when shit goes tits up, the investors in these stocks will also go tits up and FUD will kick in causing massive selloffs. (My personal opinion). Some plays on WSB are value plays, short squeeze plays, gamma squeeze plays, undervalued plays, oversold plays, etc the fucking list goes on. WSB is a god damn casino, so treat it as such. I wish you all the best and many tendies, regardless of what you're invested in. Downvote me to oblivion, idgaf. Important update: I want to say thanks to everyone for the awards, upvotes and comments. I want to clarify some FUD here after the traction from this post. When I was referring to \\~15-20% short sellers for GME I was not referring to short interest or the \"naked\" shorts everyone is talking about. Simply, that the original short sellers that are still in their positions haven't closed out their positions yet, same goes for AMC, and the big MOASS that everyone is mentioning is not what I meant when I said gamma squeeze or short squeezes. I was simply referring to when GME spiked to $438 and months after again to $330. I wasn't talking about the big MOASS. I've been on WSB since December 2020 but only joined on January 28th, 2021 when I felt like I wanted to start to contribute myself. I was here before there was 500k members. I used to only use reddit to view posts and discussion and never really felt the need to create an account until I found stock/investment subreddits etc. Hopefully this clears some shit up. Again, the purpose of this post was to explain why these 3 stocks are not the same and shouldn't be compared to each other and for people to stop shilling others and having this \"cult\" like attitude/behaviour. Oh! and the reason why my post mentions GME, AMC, CLOV is because it was the 3 top tickers on the thread for the day this post was made, 07/06/2021.

{"text": "So I made this post the US homeownership rate was a bit over 69%. In 2021 it's at 65%. In 2004 there were 122 million housing units in the US. In 2021 it's 141 million. US population in 2004 was 292 million. In 2021 it's 331 million. Throw all these numbers into a blender and you get: A 13% increase in population, a 4% decrease in homeownership rate, and a 15% increase in housing supply. Yes, that's right, the housing supply has increased faster than the population, and the homeownership rate during that time has dropped. So where the fuck is this crazy demand coming from? Are people making more money? Nope. Workers share of corporate income has fallen from 79% in 2004 to 77% in 2021. So in real terms wages are down. Is it immigrants? Nope, immigration has been falling for years. Is it young people starting families? Nope, family formation is close to all time lows and the oldest millennials who are approaching 40, are 20% poorer than boomers were at their age. Is it inflation? Nope, bond yields are currently signaling deflation, but the bond market has been wonky as fuck all year so who really knows. So basically you've got more supply relative to population, construction of new units is slowing down - 1.8 million starts in Jan to 1.7 million starts in March down to 1.6 million starts in May, prices are rising, and sales are slowing. Jan 6.5 million existing home sales, 993,000 new home sales. May 5.8 million existing home sales, 769,000 new home sales. So, to recap for the slower folks in the helmets on the short bus with the flavored windows: Prices: Up. Wages: Down. Supply relative to population: Up. Demand: Down. Sales: Down. Construction: Down. Yeah, it's a fucking bubble. And clearly, Fuckery is Afoot. Who is doing the fuckery and why I don't know. Maybe it's Chinese nationals trying to get money out of the CCP's control, maybe it's AirBnB, maybe it's Blackrock and REIT ETF's, maybe it's something else entirely, but it's definitely a bubble, and it's definitely Fuckery. TLDR: Fuckery is Afoot. It's a bubble. Don't buy a house until the market crashes. And remember, millions of units are waiting to come on the market once evictions start up again. Positions, same as the last post, puts on HYG because there are a lot of bullshit zombie companies that should have died years ago but are propped up by index investing and cheap corporate debt that the FED keeps buying, calls on SPXS because when this thing pops it's going to explode like nothing seen before to the point where Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster are going to sit around roasting marshmallows on the dumpster fire that used to be the stock market. One last nugget about housing? Residential Fixed Investment (it's a recession indicator, the acronym is apparently a banned ticker) was declining before the COVID crash, we were actually just starting a normal recession when that hit, which caused the FED to hit the panic button on the money printer. On a 30 year or more chart SPY has been vertical since the COVID bottom. Vertical lines in an index on a long term chart like that generally indicate the euphoria phase that precedes a massive crash. My date range remains unchanged, sometime between June and November of this year. If you want some specific dates to watch, check July 12th, July 19th, August 23rd, September 20th, and October 25th. I probably like August 23rd the most of those, but I buy retard positions on WSB, so you definitely shouldn't listen to me. EDIT: Sorry I've haven't updated this and am just now getting around to replies. Got my first pump and dump shill DM, so that's an achievement unlocked I guess. I just want to say how much I love all you beautiful retards. Half the goddamn replies are \"housing is up where I live so there's no bubble\" The absolute best was the guy who pointed at a bunch of houses near him that have 10x'd in the last few years, and the one he just sold that nearly 2x'd in a year and a half. Bro. THAT IS THE FUCKING BUBBLE INFLATING. Like, the sheer number of you who think pointing out high prices rising fast refutes instead of confirms my thesis is amazing. Pure WSB retardation gold there. To explain something else that I'm seeing mentioned a lot, renters ARE accounted for, so are multifamily households. That's why I used total population and total houses and homeownership rate. +40 million people and +20 million houses only works out to less supply if well more than half of those 40 million are living alone. And spoiler, they aren't. The decline in homeownership coincides with the increase in renters. EDIT2: because I'm seeing a lot of \"but people own more than one house\" posts.

{"text": "We\u2019ve built a very simple model for Tesla to see if we can make sense of its valuation. The model is very simple and has just three forecast variables: revenue growth, operating margin, and capital turns (which measure how efficiently the company utilizes its capital). These three variables are all we need to do our analysis. What we\u2019ve specifically tried to model out is what kind of financial performance Tesla would have to deliver in order to justify its current share price. This means playing with my three forecasts variables until I get to $600. I\u2019ve used consensus revenue forecasts over the next two years as a starting point, and then proceeded from there. Note that consensus revenue estimates for Tesla are $49.1 billion for 2021, and $65.7 billion for 2022. This is extraordinary, and represents growth rates of 55% and 34% over the next two years. These growth rates don\u2019t seem sustainable, so beyond 2022, I\u2019ve trended revenue growth rates down to 20% and carried this forward. I should point out that for capital intensive businesses like Tesla, revenue growth, especially at these levels, is never free, because it requires a company to continually reinvest in the business. For Tesla, it means continually investing in additional production capacity in order to meet production and sales targets. You will see this reflected in our cash flow forecasts, where annual capex requirements means negative cash flows for the first few years . In terms of margins, Tesla has seen steady improvement over the last few years as it scales up, and there\u2019s no reason to think they can\u2019t continue to improve margins further. Tesla is after all a premium brand, and commands premium pricing. Nevertheless, the EV space is attracting a lot of new players and a lot of new investment, and this will likely put a cap on Tesla\u2019s margin expansion into the future. For modelling purposes, our NOPAT margin variable is our key lever, and we\u2019ve had to ramp this up very aggressively to hit our $600 target. Tesla\u2019s NOPAT margin is currently around 5%, but we\u2019ve had to gradually move this up to 18.5% over the next few years. Now the comps we\u2019ve selected aren\u2019t perfect, but you will notice that at these levels, Tesla\u2019s NOPAT margin would be well above industry benchmarks. You will also notice that our forecasts generate an ROIC (return on invested capital) of almost 33% at its peak, again well above industry standards. ### What does it all mean? I\u2019m not going to take a view here, except to say that Tesla is priced for perfection, and this is reflected in the model numbers. Again, the purpose of the exercise was to see what kind of financial performance Tesla would have to deliver in order to justify its current share price. I\u2019ll let you decide whether you think the forecasts are reasonable or not, and then by extension whether you think the current share price can be justified. In the meantime, I am attaching a copy of the model here, so feel free to play around with it for yourself. [", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-07-04 15:19:14", "id": "odjcgs"}
{"text": "The advent of technology is changing banking, resulting in artificial intelligence's (AI) deployment in data collection, data integration, and analysis. According to an IndustryArc report, the Fintech market is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.7% between 2021 to 2026, and is anticipated to be worth $161.2 billion by 2026. Using the TipRanks stock comparison was founded in 2011 and is a fintech, or financial technology company, that offers a suite of financial products through its platform, a one-stop-shop app. The company\u2019s three major business segments include lending, a technology platform, and financial services. SoFi\u2019s lending services include student loan refinancing, personal and home loans, while its technology platform, Galileo, provides services, including an authorization application programming interface (API) to financial and non-financial institutions. The company\u2019s financial services include insurance services under SoFi Protect, a SoFi Credit Card, and Lantern Credit, a financial services marketplace. Last month, SoFi Technologies made its debut on the Nasdaq as an independent company, following its SPAC merger with blank check company Social Capital Hedosophia. In Q1, the company posted adjusted net revenues of $216 million, while the company had guided for revenues ranging between $190 million and $195 million. SoFi reported adjusted EBITDA of $4 million, and ended the quarter with 2,281 thousand members, a jump of 110% year-over-year. On June 28, SoFi\u2019s lock-up period expired. The lock-up period is the length of time after the company goes public when early employees or shareholders in the company may not sell their shares. This time period can vary between 90 to 180 days. Following the expiry of the lock-up period, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Sean Horgan on the stock. The analyst saw \u201ca unique buying opportunity as a result of this recent selling and ahead of a potentially significant upside catalyst (bank charter approval).\u201d In October last year, SoFi received preliminary conditional approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in the United States regarding its application for a national bank charter. However, this application will still need to be reviewed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. (See SoFi Technologies stock chart Analyst Horgan expects the process for approval of the bank charter to conclude by the end of this year, adding an upside of more than 25% to the analyst\u2019s EBITDA estimates. The analyst said in a note to investors, \u201cAll the catalysts we expect (in order of magnitude) are: 1) SOFI's bank charter approval/denial (expected 2021); 2) lockup period ends (June 28), employee trading restrictions expire (post-earnings, expected mid-August), senior leadership lockup expiration (Late December); 3) federal student loan forbearance period expiration (currently set for October 1, 2021); 4) rising interest rates.\u201d However, Horgan noted that a regulation that could allow for a four-year college course without paying any tuition fees could pose \u201ca substantial downside to SOFI's core student lending business, which we believe is a low-single-digit probability risk.\u201d The analyst believes that students enrolled in four-year undergraduate programs make up the \u201clargest piece of SOFI's student lending revenues and market opportunity.\u201d In Q1, SoFi\u2019s lending segment had student loan originations worth $1,468 million. Horgan also believes that a rise in regulatory scrutiny when it comes to payment for order flow (PFOF) regulations should not concern SoFi shareholders as \u201cits revenue exposure from its brokerage business is insignificant (<1% of 2020 revenues) in comparison to many retail brokers.\u201d PFOF is the compensation a brokerage firm receives for directing orders to other parties to execute trades. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 2 Buys. The average SoFi Technologies price target of $27.50 lending platform that connects consumers to its network of AI-enabled bank partners for loans. The company generates revenues primarily through fees paid by banks. The company charges referral fees to banks for every loan referred through the Upstart.com website and originated by a bank partner. UPST also charges a platform fee for every loan origination, regardless of its source, and servicing fees for loans as consumers repay them. UPST helps consumers receive personal loans by connecting them to its bank and credit union partners. It uses variables like employment and education to predict a consumer\u2019s creditworthiness. Last month, the company entered into a partnership with workflow application programming interface (API) connectivity provider NXTsoft to enable Upstart to streamline the implementation of its platform to financial institutions in the U.S. In Q1, UPST reported total revenues of $121.3 million, a jump of 90% year-over-year that surpassed the Street\u2019s estimates of $116.1 million. The company\u2019s adjusted earnings ballooned 340% year-over-year to $0.22 per share in Q1, topping consensus estimates of $0.15 per share. Upstart Holdings has projected total revenue to land between $150 million and $160 million in Q2. For 2021, the company increased its revenue expectations to approximately $600 million versus the prior guidance of $500 million. (See Upstart Holdings stock chart Following the Q1 earnings, Jeffries analyst John Hecht on the stock. Hecht remained upbeat about the stock following strong growth trends and the company\u2019s Prodigy acquisition. On March 15, the company announced the acquisition of Prodigy Software, a provider of cloud-based automotive retail software, for $100 million. In Q1, Upstart\u2019s bank partners originated 169,750 loans worth $1.73 billion across the company\u2019s platform, an increase of 102% year-over-year. The conversion rate was 22% on rate requests, up 14% year-over-year. Analyst Hecht stated, \u201c\u2026the strong loan count and improving conversion rate highlight strong growth trends as '21 progresses, with UPST's AI lending platform continuing to perform well.\u201d The analyst noted that the company\u2019s Q2 revenue guidance \u201crepresents \\~30% upside from our prior ests. \\ at the midpoint.\u201d He continued on a positive note, saying, \u201cWe continue to believe Upstart's cloudbased, Artificial Intelligence (AI) lending platform results in a superior credit product with attractive economics for both consumers and lenders, a 'win-win' model for both participants. We see LT \\, strong growth opportunities given a first-mover advantage and a very large TAM \\.\u201d Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 3 Buys and 1 Hold. The average Upstart Holdings price target of $143.25.\u201d While analysts are cautiously optimistic about SoFi, they are bullish on Upstart. Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, SoFi seems to be a better Buy. Source: [", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-07-10 02:10:44", "id": "ogxkr3"}
{"text": "There is a lot of philosophical viewpoints around going long or short against the market. Some believe shorting hurts companies and makes them bankrupt by not allowing them to raise sufficient funds through issuing more stock.

Even long-term bull markets have corrections and bear cycles in them that may last a few days, a week, or even a few weeks (eg Feb/Mar this year). If you don\u2019t have a current position, would you short the market/stocks during a bear cycle or add to existing positions to leverage down?

{"text": "I missed last week's post, but it's at least been a bit quiet given the quarter end and the holiday / general seasonality. Summer is upon us and we're staring at the second half of the year, maybe some wondering where we'll go from here with the SPY up %16 on the year already. My guess in the very short-term would be up a bit more, but maybe we don't end the year this high. Who knows? Since the volatility in mid-May we've had a seeming change in leadership and though indices have melted upward there's been some good churn underneath. I had started a post for the previous week focusing on some market breadth data/indicators, and I think it's even more worth a look now that indices are starting to look stretch in this last leg, given these can give an indication into how \"healthy\" this advance is (hint: the more stocks going up the better). Unfortunately I'm throwing this together last minute, so I'm not getting to dig as deep here as I'd like. The S5FI / NDFI indices track the percentage of stocks in the S&P 500 / NDX above their 50 day moving average. This and other indices like it offer an idea of market breadth, i.e. how many stocks are actually participating in this rally. In the last week we\u2019ve picked up from some recent lows and now have ~%50 of S&P 500 stocks above their 50DMA, which is a pretty good sign of participation in this rally. SPY / S5FI 1y stocks within an index are hitting 52-week highs - a helpful indication that it's not just a few stocks pushing us up : ( ( Another interesting chart to look at is that of SKEW: ( SKEW is an interesting indicator. Usually ranging from 100 to 150, the former suggests normal perceived market returns and trends toward the latter suggest volatility ahead. Recently SKEW has traded at ATHs, 170+. While historically it\u2019s not been a good predictor of realized volatility as can be seen in the chart, it\u2019s interesting in that it\u2019s a measure of perceived risk in the markets, basically elevated expectations of a black swan event. So while you probably shouldn\u2019t trade on it, it\u2019s a view into market sentiment for the next 30 days. Now let's move on to our general chart rundown... #Charts Sector Performance ( ( And the major indices... ( ( ( TAKEAWAYS - This recent push back to ATHs in SPY and QQQ seems to have been led by a rotation / leadership back in tech / growth. - Indicators around participation suggest we've got good \"breadth\" here, meaning it's a general advance and not just the biggest index components pushing us higher while everything else lags. - Technically things look good, though possibly starting to look stretched... no reason to doubt this push higher though. - Not pictured here but VIX remains subdued. Always good to watch for this creeping up though. - Considering current sentiment, seasonality, and known catalysts, it's hard to see why we wouldn't churn higher - Converse to the previous statement, keep in mind that most often the catalyst which causes the damage is one that we never see. #Bonus Charts Not this week... ####Previous", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-07-06 04:52:15", "id": "oel95o"}
{"text": "Some general Info about HIMS- Hims & Hers ($HIMS) is a telemedicine company which allows anybody across the continental United States(and soon to be UK and Europe) to purchase medicine discreetly, safely, quickly, and inexpensively straight to your door. For prescription medicine, Hims & Hers employs hundreds of specialized doctors, which can prescribe medicine through call, text, or video chat. Hims & Hers offers a wide variety of products which continues to expand, such as: -Hair Loss and Care -Sex products (ED, PE, Birth Control) -Skin Care/Acne products -Covid Tests -Supplements -Primary Care -Mental Care etc... So I wanted to do some DD because Earnings should be coming out sometime early-mid august and I expect this to be the first quarter where they can show positive EBITDA, I would expect nothing less than absolutely stellar numbers across the board, with a highlight on YoY revenue growth. - Customer acquisition, expanding their base of users and subscriptions by expanding into multiple sectors of mens, womens and even mental health - Bridging the gap between being a telehealth provider and the standard retail brick and mortar model, by establishing partnerships with companies like Target and Urban outfitters putting their products in these big box stores that we all shop at. - Acquiring companies like Apostrophe, which is a multi-specialty telehealth platform, it was also a competitor, well not anymore now HIMS is the parent company. (Remember how FB liked to buy out all of their competition until they became the biggest platform on the planet... ya HIMS is taking a page straight out of the Zuck's playbook) - Future Growth prospects; HIMS is expanding into the UK and Europe giving them access to a greater reach of customers, and as we all know, balding, ED, Acne, etc... is not something there is a permanent cure for and something a lot of people suffer from, with a subscription based model they're basically able to lock in long time recurring customers, so you put 2 and 2 together, you put the product in more countries, you get more subscribers. - Before you tell me that HIMS hasn't turned a profit BLA BLA BLA, Let's look at their last earnings report. Financially stable - over 90 Million in cash on hand + short term investments, with 0 short/long term debt Gross Margin of 77% last Quarter, 74% for 2020 (54% in 2019) 2.6B Market Cap Negative (but improving) Cash Flow Q4 EPS of -.07 (Beat by .09) Revenue of $148.8 MM for 2020, 80% yoy growth 2020 Q4 Revenue of $41.5 MM (Beat by $4.47 MM) Q1 2021 Revenue expects $48 - $50 MM $195 - $205 MM overall 2021 Revenue estimate Over 3 Million consultations 91% Recurring Revenue Simply put, Hims & Hers has consistent, growing revenue and gross margin growth, and the driving factor for their negative EBITDA are their investments into furthering expansion, customer acquisition/company acquisitions that will only help solidify their cash flow and subscription services on the back end in the future. Last point, just from a trading perspective, HIMS is down thirty percent the last month, and went down 8 percent today, Now is the time to buy a few weeks before a potentially huge earnings report, and with 52 wk low of 8.09, It's definitely at or near the bottom right now. Please note, this isn't a fucking short squeeze BUT the short interest 13% which is kind of high...

{"text": "Jeff Bezos is trying to down play Sir Richard Branson & Virgin Galactic's outstanding performance traveling into outer space this past weekend. Jeff Bezos is saying \"50 miles up is not outer space, but that 60 miles up is outer space.\" Meanwhile when Bezos goes up (which won't happen because he's afraid to even get an elevator) they'll be going to the same threshold between 50 and 60 miles. The average person traveling into space without proper conditioning, will not be able to handle anything past that. While Sir Richard Branson has always been well ahead in the game. The comments from bezos show he hasn't been able to get over it, with all the excitement and news Virgin Galactic has posted and received. Virgin Galactic's plane was designed for hypersonic speed. Hypersonic flight is coming. The idea of a nice jaunt into outer space for a joyride sounds fun, nevertheless soon people are going to be able to take hypersonic planes as a means of transportation anywhere in the world within two ~ four hours flight time. That's the goal. There's also a big difference in the designs between all three space companies. Virgin Galactic is following the X aircraft design, specifically the Boeing X-20 Dyno. The other space companies are using old Apollo technology with a capsule perched a top a rocket that comes back through the upper atmosphere with parachutes deployed landing wherever the wind takes you. The most important part of Virgin Galactic's hypersonic plane design is the feathering braking system that lets the plane float down through the atmosphere like a badminton birdie. The feathering system is based on Rutan's designs. The entire tail structure can rotate upward, giving the plane the ability to slow down and float like a feather as it re-enters the upper atmosphere. The plane then lands on a runway.

{"text": "Never done a DD before, so this will def be shit. Looking for someone to tell me why I'm retarded. Micron Technology, Inc. is an American producer of computer memory and computer data storage including DRAM, flash memory, and USB flash drives. It is headquartered in Boise, Idaho. Its consumer products are marketed under the brands Crucial and Ballistix. Current share price - $74.8 Market Cap - $88 Billion Basically, they make ram sticks and hard drives for computers. They have roughly 17.7% of the market share for memory, main competitors Samsung Electronics Co and SK Hynix Inc as main competitors. What the three companies have in memory has been described as an oligopoly. The type of memory they make is used in almost every data intensive computing environment. Their memory chips are inside RTX-3080\u2019s and 90\u2019s, data centers, and a shit ton of cars. The more AI is used, the more dRam memory is needed. These are the only companies that sell it. Income and recent history \u2013 Because of its commodity status, Microns revenue has always been tied to pricing in memory. \u200b From 2016 to 2018, Micron had explosive revenue growth, and in 2019 this fell back down as memory prices fell. While the memory business has had cyclicality over the years, it is on an always upward baseline, where the new lowest years equate with what used to be mid-level years, and the high years setting record revenues. The company\u2019s products have a very high margin, so profits are very sensitive to total revenue. The company has improved its balance sheet substantially in the last couple years, which will allow for smoother down years and better growth years. When the price of memory dropped in previous years, micron would have slightly negative earnings on the year. In the most recent down period (2020), the company still had an EPS of 2.37, compared with last downturn where it was negative. The memory cycle bottomed out in 2020, and expected sales are expected to BOOM in 2021. Average revenue estimate is 36.9 billion. High estimates go up to 43 billion. Look at what earnings when revenue was at 30, if it got to 40 billion their EPS would be FAT. Balance Sheet - Microns balance sheet is fucking clean. They have 54 Billion in total assets (17 current) and 13 Billion in liabilities (5.4 current). In 2017 they reduced long term debt from 9 billion to 3 billion, and since then has reduced interest from around 500 million a year around 2016 and 2017, to about 200 million a year now. This is despite having increased assets by 27 billion in the same time frame. If Micron closed up shop today and just fucking scrapped everything and sold its assets and factories, it would be worth nearly half its share price. This number is probably UNDERSTATED, considering there is a lot of written off depreciation on their factories, and there is no way in hell their newer factories are worth less than it cost to build. Book value doesn\u2019t matter that much, but that is an insane price to book in comparison to any other growing company in this environment. Micron\u2019s products aren\u2019t nearly as flashy or interesting, but they are NEEDED. Future Almost all AI driving, smart phones, and data centers require dRam. The overall demand should increase substantially for the foreseeable future. Micron will use cashflow for share buybacks, and they are going to have a shit ton of it this year. Next two years are projected to be boom years for memory. Another thing going for Micron is its U.S. based status. With chip shortage around the world, the U.S. has taken a strategic position that the country needs domestic chip manufacturers. Both of Microns competitors are foreign entities. They may be eligible for stimulus or government assistance if they build domestically, but Micron is the best positioned for Biden Bucks. Other shit that is promising Some big hedge fund managers have retardedly large bets on Micron. Monish Pabrai \u2013 50% of portfolio. Li Lu \u2013 51.7% of portfolio. David Tepper \u2013 9% of portfolio. It is the largest investment in all of their portfolios. Last reported share price they were holding at was $88, or 16% higher than today\u2019s price. I\u2019m pretty sure not all of them are retarded. Short Interest You\u2019re retarded for even looking at this. What is wrong with you? Its not very high though, you\u2019d need a very smooth brain to short this stock. Positions Missionary. Only adding up shares and itm leaps as I ride out the current downtrend but this shit is way undervalued. Especially in this market. They\u2019re being priced like a boomer stock that\u2019s slowly dying instead of a growing company with a shit ton of money, with huge profits, that makes a product EVERYONE needs. If they hit revenue targets this year they would be trading at only 6x forward earnings. Dumb. Should be $110 right now and that would be cheap.

{"text": "Lock-up expirations are usually considered to be a negative event for a stock, as early investors get a chance to sell their shares and take their profit. The fear is that the flood of new shares coming on the market will drive the stock price down. I think this becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy in many cases, as investors sell in advance of the lock-up expiration for fear that it will go down. Not all investors sell. Some will believe in the long term vision and wait for the company to grow. Even so, some investors do cash out some portion of their shares. There\u2019s no way to know how many shares will actually be sold once the lookup expires, but I\u2019ve seen a number of people say 1-3%. That uncertainty is often a big factor in people getting nervous and selling as the lock-up approaches, or immediately afterwards. Some people have posited that stocks goes up after the lock-up because many institutional investors wait for the inevitable dip on lock-up expiration to enter long positions. I think this might be a case of \u201csell the rumor, buy the news.\u201d Most stocks sell off prior to lock-up expirations, as investors worry that investors will unload their shares. Once the lockup is out of the way, it can actually become a tailwind for the stock if conditions are right. If insiders aren\u2019t selling, lock-up expirations can benefit the stock, leading to significantly higher prices for in the subsequent weeks. Palentir ($PLTR) Many investors are gun-shy after companies like Palentir got hit hard on lock-up expiration. PLTR was an unusual case, though, with a massive 1.8 billion shares coming onto the market. The unlocked shares were an astounding 24 times the 30 day average volume. No matter how good a company is, it\u2019s hard for the market to absorb those kind of numbers. Another complication was that the lock-up was effective upon release of PLTR\u2019s quarterly earnings. Even though the numbers looked great to me, apparently wiser people on Wall Street were disappointed in the quarterly report, adding more downward pressure on the stock. PLTR stock went down 29% in the subsequent weeks, and still hasn\u2019t gotten back to the pre lock-up expiration price. PLTR Lock-up Expiration Summary \u2014 30 Day Avg Volume: 74.33 million \u2014 Shares unlocked: 1.8 billion \u2014 Unlocked shares as a % of Avg Volume: 2,422% \u2014 Post Lock-up Performance: 29% Loss Lock-up Expiration as a Positive Catalyst Despite the bad performance of PLTR, several other stocks booked significant gains after their lock-ups expired. WISH, NKLA and DASH all traded significantly higher after their lock-up expirations. ContextLogic ($WISH) WISH traded at 7.84 the day before its lock-up expired on 5/25. It had a slight dip and traded sideways for a few days, then climbed significantly. (Note: One publication erroneously reported the lockup expiration as 6/14, which could explain the second dip ahead of that date). It closed at $14.04 a month later, a gain of 79% after the lockup expired. WISH had 46 million shares unlocked, more than 4 times its average daily volume of 10.88 million shares over the prior month. On top of that, both the CEO and CFO registered to sell shares prior to the lock-up expiration. Despite that, the stock price soared in subsequent weeks, in part due to the attention it got among retail investors. WISH Lock-up Expiration Summary \u2014 30 Day Avg Volume: 10.88 million \u2014 Shares unlocked: 46 million \u2014 Unlocked shares as a % of Avg Volume: 423% \u2014 Post Lock-up Performance: 79% Gain Nikola ($NKLA) NKLA is another stock that logged major gains after its lock-up expiration, despite a lot of negative media attention in advance. An article on Yahoo! Finance warned \u201cNikola Lock-Up Expiration Could Be A Ticking Timebomb when the lock-up expired made a very nice gain. NKLA Lock-up Expiration Summary \u2014 30 Day Avg Volume: 26.664 million \u2014 Shares unlocked: 52 million \u2014 Unlocked shares as a % of Avg Volume: 197% \u2014 Post Lock-up Performance: 67% Gain DoorDash ($DASH) DASH was another high profile stock expected to take a major hit after the lock-up expired, in part because of its high stock price at $142.5. That\u2019s a lot of incentive for early insiders to sell and take their gains. DASH\u2019s lock-up expiration was 6/7/21, with 33 million shares unlocked, 670% of the average daily trading volume leading up to lock-up expiration. There was a huge spike in volume the day of lock-up expiration, with a brief dip. DASH quickly bounced back, followed by a 26% gain in the next 2 weeks. Once again, investors who bought the dip made a nice profit. DASH Lock-up Expiration Summary \u2014 30 Day Avg Volume: 4.92 million \u2014 Shares unlocked: 33 million \u2014 Unlocked shares as a % of Avg Volume: 670% \u2014 Post Lock-up Performance: 26% Gain Other Examples \u2014 LMND +70% \u2014 UBER +47% \u2014 CHWY +20% Could Lock-up Expiration be a Positive Catalyst? Looking at the previous examples and their metrics, I believe the lock-up expirations will give investors a great chance\u2014and maybe the last chance\u2014 to buy the dip for both SOFI and CLOV. Both are high visibility targets of short sellers, with high short interest. Both are frequently mentioned in the context of possible squeezes. I think the visibility among retail investors and the details of the lock-ups will give each an interesting opportunity. SoFi Technologies ($SOFI) SOFI\u2019s first lockup expired on 6/28/21. Benzinga and other sources stated that the lockup expired for 5% of the shareholders, and that this lock-up does not apply to PIPE investors (institutional investors like Blackrock, who were not locked up). [ After reading all the SEC filings, it\u2019s clear as mud. It appears that there are 26.2 million shares in the group where the lock-up that just expired. [ Note: Additional lock-ups may expire for other investors as early as late July and/or mid August based on performance of the stock, which seems very likely at a this point. [ SOFI Lock-up Expiration Summary \u2014 30 Day Avg Volume: 6.9 million \u2014 Shares unlocked: 26.2 million (?) \u2014 Unlocked shares as a % of Avg Volume: 341% \u2014 Post Lock-up Performance: ?? \u200b Lower % of unlocked shares as a % of average volume than DASH or WISH did. DASH went up 26% and WISH went up 79% after their respective lock-ups expired. Target of short-sellers. This would be a logical point for shorts to cover. One of the top 10 stocks on HypeEquity. It\u2019s getting a lot of attention, and that could accelerate the post lock-up rebound. As with the other stocks, it traded down in advance of the lock-up expiration. It\u2019s currently in the same choppy price action the others did before rebounding and moving higher. Another post here called the bottom the day the lock-up expired. I think that was a few days premature. NKLA, WISH and DASH all dipped after the lock-up expiration. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in SOFI now. I think the impact of the lock-up expiration is now priced in, and this is the opportunity to buy the dip. They\u2019ve sold the rumor\u2014now it\u2019s time to buy the news. Clover Healthcare ($CLOV) Today (7/6/21) is the lock-up expiration has 40 million shares ready to register for sale on the market. In an interesting twist, that\u2019s just 35% of the past 30 days average volume\u2014significantly lower than every other stock on this list. Granted, there has been unusual volume in the past month, so what does that really mean? Just to be conservative, I excluded June 8th and 9th from the average volume calculations (the last big spike), bringing the 30 day average daily volume down to 70 million. The unlocked shares would still only account for 57% of the average volume, still by far the lowest percentage on this list, and still much less than NKLA (197%), WISH (423%), or DASH (670%) had during their lock-up expirations. Those stocks had major gains after lock-up expiration. CLOV Lock-up Expiration Summary \u2014 30 Day Avg Volume: 70 million (adjusted) \u2014 Shares unlocked: 40 million \u2014 Unlocked shares as a % of Avg Volume: 57% \u2014 Post Lock-up Performance: ?? \u200b Lowest % of unlocked shares as a % average volume of any company on this list. High profile target of short sellers, and it has been one of the top stocks on HypeEquity for the past week Shares are hard to borrow and Short Borrow Fee is high This may be a great opportunity to pick up shares at a discount. A post lock-up rally could be the trigger for the much awaited short squeeze. Conclusions I realize this is not an exhaustive list. I know there are more examples of stocks moving in both directions. I\u2019d be very interested to see the results if some enterprising individual wants to do a more complete analysis with more stocks. Two key points to look at for an approaching lock-up expiration: \u2014 The number of Unlocked Shares as a % of Average monthly volume \u2014 What\u2019s going on in the bigger picture (i.e. earnings reports, potential short squeeze, or other news) After the lock-up expiration, watch the insider and institutional investors buying or selling. In both cases, PLTR was very different than NKLA, WISH and DASH, and had very different results. PLTR had a massive 1.8 billion shares unlocked immediately after its quarterly earnings report, and the stock declined significantly. NKLA, WISH and DASH all had significantly fewer shares unlocked relative to average monthly volume, and all 3 had major gains after they got past lock-up expiration. The Bottom Line Given all hype and excitement about SOFI and CLOV, I think it\u2019s realistic to expect both stocks to have major gains in the weeks ahead once their lock-up expirations are behind them. \u200b Both declined in advance of lock-up expiration, right on schedule Both have high short interest and high borrow fees Both have a lot of buzz Both are small, growing companies that are using tech to disrupt different industries. I believe the lock-up expiration will provide a positive tailwind for both companies. Once the lock-up is in the rear view mirror, that will be a logical entry point for institutional investors to start or add to their positions, for individual investors to get the shares on sale, and for shorts to cover. Based on the gains of NKLA, WISH and DASH in the 4-6 weeks after their lock-ups expired, I expect to see major gains for both stocks\u2014even without a squeeze. I think this lock-up expiration will be a fantastic buying opportunity. It would also be a logical time for short sellers to cover and close out their trades, so that bounce could be harder than usual. Retail investors may see the stocks on sale and load up the truck. In fact, the post lock-up gains could be the catalyst that causes a squeeze in one or both stocks. All in all, I expect a bumpy ride with plenty of potholes and head fakes, but I personally believe both are set up for nice gains in the weeks ahead. TL/DR Stocks tend to dip upon lock-up expirations, in part because it\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophesy, with investors \u2018selling the rumor and buying the news.\u2019 When the stock does dip on lock-up expiration, that can be a great buying opportunity\u2014depending on the number of shares with lock-ups expiring, and the average daily volume. PLTR had a massive 1.8 billion shares unlocked, 2,422% of the average volume, causing major downward pressure. Within a few weeks after their lock-up expirations, NKLA gained 67%, WISH gained 79%, and DASH gained 26%. Both SOFI and CLOV have the stage set for major gains after their lock-up expirations. Expect a dip and some choppy trading leading up to, and a couple days after the lock-up expiration\u2014that\u2019s the buying opportunity. Don\u2019t try to time the exact low. You\u2019ll drive yourself crazing and it will still catch you off guard. Full Disclosure* I\u2019m not sure why everyone always says this, but I\u2019ll play\u2014\u201cthis is not financial advice.\u201d There, I said it. Please do your own due diligence. If anyone finds errors in these numbers, dates or calculations, please let me know. I\u2019m just another retail investor trying to figure things out on my own. A note on methodology: I used closing prices the session prior to the lock-up expiring, but in most cases, the dip actually started 2-5 days earlier. \u201cSell the rumor, buy the news.\u201d The impact and timing varied from stock to stock, though. To keep it consistent, I\u2019m calculating gains or losses as of the market close the day before the lock-up expired to the high price in the next 4-6 weeks.

{"text": "TL;DR: Almost all the key signs that caused the housing market crash in 2008 are back stronger than ever. Mortgage debt is at ATH, consumer debt is 2x higher than ever, lumber futures are down 60% but physical lumber isn't moving, unemployment is still 50% higher than in 2009, housing starts are double what they were in 2008, and median house prices just broke $300,000 for the first time ever, inflation adjusted. All of which are bearish indicators for the economy. Houses r fuk \u200b 1.) Mortgage Debt and Consumer Debt is at an All Time High Having high mortgage debt makes your house a debt and not an asset. It is sitting right above 10 trillion dollars. If it goes any higher, we are at an extreme risk for higher foreclosures. However, consumer debt may be a greater issue. It is currently nearing 2x what it was in 2008. \u200b \u200b 2.) Lumber Futures Have Fallen, Physical Has Not Another way to tell if we are in a bubble is by comparing the futures market to actual prices. When there is a large gap in these two, it usually indicates people are still willing to pay much higher prices for a large supply. It doesn't make any economical sense. People still feel that lumber is in extremely high demand, and will buy lumber (which isn't in high demand), and buy as much as they can anticipating the price to continue going up. It's artificial price increases. \u200b [ \u200b 3.) Unemployment is Still Extremely High After COVID Restrictions Lifted Unemployment numbers are still 50% higher than they were in 2019. There's no reason to go back to work for \\~2% of the population, because the stimulus checks and unemployment add up to more than minimum wage. This money has to come from somewhere, a.k.a money printing. This in turn adds up to more inflation, which is my next point. \u200b [ \u200b [BRRRRRRR Inflation is the Highest it has been in 31 Years Jpow, our lord and savior, announced today inflation was above expectations of 5%. This has not happened since 1990. Hmm. AP article Housing Starts are Double What They Were in 2008, Nearing 2005 (Peak) Levels Housing starts measure how many houses are being built. It is currently at around 1,500 a month. They are still recovering from 2005 but quickly approaching 2005 levels. More houses being built means that there is more supply flowing in. \u200b [ \u200b 6.) Median House Prices are at $300,000, Up Nearly 100% From 2012 Although the housing crisis ended around 2009, the bottom for housing prices was in 2012. Since then, housing prices are well above their 2008 levels, even adjusted for inflation. This is a bad sign for the housing market. Having high housing prices means more debt, which leads to more defaults. \u200b [ \u200b 7.) 30 Year Fixed Mortgages are at an All Time Low This is not necessarily a bad sign for the housing economy, but it means if we were to have a recession, it could be really bad. To fix recessions, the fed usually lowers interest rates, which is like turning the economy off and on again. It works most of the time. The grey bars in this picture are recessions. Notice how about halfway through each recession, the interest rates decrease, and the recession shortly ends. Interest rates are already incredibly low, so this may not be an option for the next recession without making interest rates negative. Having negative interest rates triggers more panic buying houses people can't afford, which results in more defaults. It will quickly become a chain reaction of hell. \u200b [ \u200b This is my first DD, hopefully it's decent. I will be responding to comments. Edit: due to the high number of comments, I will not be able to respond to most of them. I did not expect this post to get this popular. I was anticipating being called a retard (which around half of you are). What I've learned: 1.) This housing market is not really like 2008. It's more secure today, or at least what we know is. 2.) Lumber prices really indicate a bullish position on the housing market. I was wrong about the gap between the futures and physical. I have also been told that was worded poorly. 3.) When you really put effort into a post, it does well.

{"text": "Hello I am an Ivy League Econ major who somehow has both delusions of grandeur and a raging inferiority complex. My high school classmates voted me \"Most Likely to Lose Virginity at a Massage Parlor in Thailand.\" Please see below my thoughts on the (rather niche) meme stock Bed Bath & Beyond, which trades on the Nasdaq as $BBBY. Preface I'll admit it. I was initially drawn to this stock by nostalgia. I remember roaming these wide fluorescent aisles as a wonderstruck child, holding my mother's hand and nibbling on a Pokemon card. I remember the smells of the exotic lotions and the textures of the plush towels. It was pure opulence. But wankery and nostalgia aside, it is my not-so-humble opinion that there are many, many reasons why this stock is a compelling gamble. The Growth Story Delicious Current ratio of 1.56 is very healthy Management is confident enough to regularly buy back shares. They clearly care about their shareholders. They used to pay a dividend before COVID as well, but it is not clear if/when this will be reinstated Potential Catalysts A huge catalyst this summer is college shopping as in-person attendance picks up. Thanks to COVID, essentially 2+ years worth of students will be moving out from their parents' place and into college for the first time The turnaround may be a 3 year plan, but investors will continue to reward the stock as long as management keeps meeting milestones. All in all, keep an eye out for FY21Q2 earnings in a couple months. Could see a major move upward. I plan to build out my position by then * If inflation is indeed not transitory, and we are headed for a market downturn, people are still going to buy pillows and blankets and shit. Consumer cyclical stocks are good during inflation The Bear Case Unlike certain bag holders on this sub (cough cough CLOV CLNE WISH cough cough), I can admit that this is definitely a gamble. This is not a sure thing. Upside could be limited, because big money investors are starting to be bullish on the turnaround too. And, of course, the turnaround may fall flat. Amazon exists. Retail/e-commerce is a dog fuck dog world, and Amazon is bigass dog in a smallass doggy day care. Revenue is on a long-term downtrend, and management is yet to demonstrate that they can surpass the performance from the brick and mortar glory days of yore. Also, my credibility is suspect. I'm emotional, impulsive, and honestly -- despite my obvious and staggering genius -- I do a lot of dumb shit. So don't just take my word on this. Follow your heart.

{"text": "Electric school buses may be the next wave of EVs to hit the commercial market, one executive within the industry says. Patrick Gervais, Lion Electric (LEV) VP of marketing and communication, discussed the progress made with electric vehicles on a Yahoo Finance Live segment Tuesday afternoon. \u201cI think there\u2019s a really good intention to electrify 100% of school buses within the next couple of years,\u201d Gervais said. \u201cWe could feel the hype all across the United States. I mean, we\u2019ve delivered buses in New York, in Minnesota, all across the country.\u201d The infrastructure bill, which is supported by President Biden, is expected to provide an additional $15 billion to electric vehicles infrastructure. Under the framework of the bill, $7.5 billion is to be allocated to schools and public transit organizations to help convert to electric buses. Gervais noted that a transition to electric school buses would have a plethora of benefits besides a reduction in carbon emissions. \u201cThere\u2019s no noise pollution, so it\u2019s more quiet and the kids are more calm and more concentrated when they go to school,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the kids and the people of tomorrow will drive electric cars in the future.\u201d Currently, less than 1% of school buses are electric. Over 400,000 school buses drive over 3.5 billion miles each year, according to a Bellwether Education Partners study. The transition to electric buses will take initiative, but with the right moves, Gervais said, the entirety of the US school bus fleet could be electrified in 10-15 years. Abroad, electric vehicles have sparked the interest of consumers of late \u2014 11% of the 11.6 million new cars registered in the EU, Iceland, Norway and Britain last year were either fully electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.

{"text": "I've been following VIRT since the CEO went on OddLots podcast to call bs on the misinformation about payment for orderflow (PFOF) and market making that happened around GMC/AMC/this subreddit. Have a listen here to execute and analyse trades. Quoting from the most recent Quarterly (can't link because URL has brackets): > The Company has two operating segments: Market Making and Execution Services > Market Making principally consists of market making in the cash, futures and options markets across global equities, options, fixed income, currencies and commodities. As a market maker, the Company commits capital on a principal basis by offering to buy securities from, or sell securities to, broker dealers, banks and institutions. Think of Market Making like the guy who punches your ticket when you go on a ride at the fair. Every time you want to go on the YOLOcoaster, if VIRT is doing a good job, they get to be the one to punch your ticket. More and more types of market trading are impossible to profit from compared to 30 years ago when you could go long above some moving average and exit a week later for a nice profit. Market Making is one of the few profitable trading games left in town, and it has the nice property of making more money when markets are volatile or volumes are high. Buying VIRT gets you ownership in a successful business that makes money doing trading that is impossible for someone to do from their basement on Robinhood. VIRT has to compete for this against other market makers like Citadel or Susquehanna, but if they're good then make a tiny little bit of money in every trade they successfully compete on. Hopefully lightbulbs are starting to go off. The more WSB and Robinhood and weekly YOLO options keep growing, the more opportunities for VIRT to compete and make tiny slices of money selling you AMC calls or whatever the next thing is. Aside from all the usual stuff they make markets in, there was also a recent announcement they are going to partner with Pyth Network and is a much more high margin business as well. This is the white glove part of their business, where some investment bank or whatever might not sneeze at paying millions of dollars to get some analytics on how their traders are executing on the NYSE, or some endowments wants to get out of a big position in a dark liquidity pool without show volume on the exchange. There are many other interesting use cases and tools of Execution Services listed here and much less competition. If they can grow this it'll be a big deal and I feel like right now the market trades VIRT as if it was just doing Market Making, so you are kind of getting Execution Services for free. Fundamentals I don't do my own fundamental analysis, but rather I get my numbers from NewConstructs available to keep doing buybacks until May 4 2022. Risks The price was recently trending up around $30 and got the big 10%+ smack down when Gary Gensler came out in June and ( Now I think the market has this wrong. Because: Firstly, I don't think PFOF will go away. PFOF is how Robinhood and other brokers are offering commission free trading. If Gensler bans it, he would be smashing the business model that all the big brokers and Robinhood have adopted. Who's going to want to start paying commissions again after it was free? Secondly, even if PFOF goes away, what does that mean for VIRT? Market Making doesn't disappear, it's still essential. So they shed some costs by not having to pay to get the order flow and now it's just pure competition between them and other Market Makers for that business. Listen to the CEO on OddLots linked up the top and see how he talks about their competitive position. Another major risk is that all markets globally go into a low volume, low volatility period because this is the least profitable environment for Market Making. But I think this risk is mitigated by the valuation. Even if there is a big decline in the business and everything is halved, their ROIC would be 25%, FCF yield 7%, economic book value $150.

{"text": "With lactose intolerance posing an epidemic to the world as we smell it, artisanal drinks in the palms of every hipster & Gen Z\u2019er, and the conservationist movement gaining traction faster than ever, there was no better time for the massive $10 billion IPO recently done by the king of oat milk - OATLY. Hailed for its relatively low environmental impact and high sustainability, oat milk does something that other milk alternatives such as soy milk and almond milk have failed miserably at - it mimics the taste and consistency of real cow\u2019s milk exceptionally well. Oat milk has a chemical makeup that allows it to blend seamlessly with coffee, remaining intact and complementing the flavor rather than separating and dominating it. And with recent innovations in oat-based ice creams and yogurts, there\u2019s no ceiling for the plant-based gangbusters. Oatly is backed by a variety of high-profile investors, from the renowned Blackstone Group to celebrities such as Jay Z and Oprah Winfrey. The hype has culminated in an extraordinary market grab from oat milk in past two years - up to a 300-500% increase in sales for varieties found in the refrigerated section of your local supermarket, according to SPINS. Consumer Insights data says that this category will grow by 20-25% over the next three years. Cow milk, on the other hand, has been losing favor amongst various demographics, such as vegans, those sensitive to dairy, and conservationists - production of Oatly over cow\u2019s milk results in 80% less greenhouse gas emissions, 79% less land usage, 60% less energy consumption, and up to 90% less water usage, as cited in a University of Oxford study, and reported by CNBC. Oatly has emerged as the clear favorite in the oat race - MarketWatch reports that Oatly generated close to half a billion dollars in revenue in 2020, doubling its total from 2019. Now present in up to 100,000 stores and coffee shops worldwide, 2021 projects to be the biggest year yet for the emerging brand. According to Yahoo Finance, the brand plans to spend over a billion dollars to build supply and increase production capacity across North America, Asia, and Europe. After its IPO at a price of $17 a share, Oatly quickly soared to highs of $29. Recently, the price has pulled back down to its current value of $21 a share, which makes it a prime candidate for a bounce back.

{"text": "Alright, so I have recently seen an uptick in stupidity regarding the housing market, and I have finally had enough. I am going to explain, clearly, why people are dumb for waiting in this housing market. I am also going to eviscerate the half-assed due diligence that has, lately, been put forward and which has compounded people\u2019s wildly speculative hope about the housing market going \u201cdown\u201d. To be \u201cconstructive,\u201d I\u2019ve written up how you CAN purchase a house if you don\u2019t have a leg up for cheaper than you initially might have if you didn\u2019t follow the instruction manual. CH 1. The History Lesson: The Past Informs the Future From the moment one is born, there are overarching needs that must be fulfilled to survive. Things that you need to survive, as opposed to wanting. When one looks at their needs, versus their wants, it is imperative to look at Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs. A baby needs their physiological needs met or they will die, and this does not change as you grow into adulthood. These are your foundational needs, from which everything else can grow. You need food, water, sleep, and shelter. \u201cThe land is the only thing in the world worth working for, worth fighting for, worth dying for, because it's the only thing that lasts\".....Gerald O'Hara, Gone With The Wind.\u201d Land is a finite resource, and land in desirable areas are even more so. While population density in areas ebb and flow, this principle largely holds true as a rule of thumb. However, this is not a function of only the finiteness of land, but of the conceptual theory of ownership. Common land or property refers to land or property that is completely open for access, such as a public park freely available to everyone. Even though there are some restrictions to this common land, the fundamental property is for enjoyment by all and held in common trust. On the other hand, when an individual or small unit owns land, they hold the sole right to use and enjoy that land. If I may be so bold as to make a Dumas pun, common land is \u201cOne for all,\u201d and Private Land is \u201cAll for one.\u201d With that said, let us zoom forward and take an overhead view of the 2008 crisis. After all, the \u201chouse of cards\u201d fell apart for land, didn\u2019t it? No, what fell apart was human hubris my dearest reader. For, you see, land and property are not irrational. Humans are. In the years leading to 2008, and 2008 itself, there were numerous failed safeguards which lead to the collapse of property prices. In fact, I argue that the Bush Administration intentionally under regulated the mortgage industry in the hopes of boosting homeownership rates. The first was the fact that people were being approved for loans with no down payments, which meant they had no skin in the game if property values went down. The second reason was that income verification was nonexistent. Finally ARM loans, otherwise known as adjustable-rate mortgages, were huge back then, and banks would push these loans in addition to no down payment loans. Therefore, a mortgage payment that was at one point 200 could skyrocket to 800 a month (and to be clear, these were mostly interest payments and not principal payments). As you can imagine, most of these loans went to people of color or low-income families. Finally, these shitty loans were coupled with genuinely good loans, and packaged into investment products known as mortgage-backed securities with an A rating (misleading, to say the least). Combine that with the fact that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not federally backed at the time, and you get a recipe for disaster when the Great Recession hits. After all, when you have no equity in your home, and you are suddenly underwater\u2026 There is no reason to stay is there? Ch 2. The Present Is a Function of The Past Now that we have explained why there was a crash in 2008, we can clarify why today is different. The first reason, and the simplest, is that homebuilders were scarred after 2008 and have persistently underbuilt. The conservative estimate is that we have a home inventory shortage of 3.8M homes, and it will take years (if not almost a decade) to rectify. Household formations are also increasing significantly as the largest population group (millennials) are aging into their prime home buying years. This will continue for, at least, the next five years. There is ongoing, additional, demand for an additional 1.2M homes a year and this does not cut into account the severe shortage right now. Homebuilding starts sit at around 1.577M a year at a seasonally adjusted rate for May which is the latest reported data.]( Building Permits stand at around 1.681M. That means homebuilders are only decreasing the deficit by roughly 377K homes this year if things stay as, they have been. So, let us go with a hypothetical. Say there are ten people who do not have a home but have money and want to buy one. However, there are only homes for three people available. 10 people are fighting for three homes, which means that the demand significantly outweighs the supply. Hence, bidding wars start. Then, to add to this conundrum, in the next year 1.2 people are added to the list of people who are looking to buy a home. So, there are 11.2 people now looking for a home, but home supply has only increased to 4.4. So, while supply has increased, slightly, relative to demand it is quite slight. To add to this, a not statistically insignificant portion of people have left higher cost of living areas to live elsewhere due to the work from home trend. These people either owned, and sold, their homes in said higher cost of living area or\u2026 They had saved up to buy a home in a higher cost of living area. When they move to a lower cost of living area, they are therefore able to considerably outbid others since they have a much higher cash hoard. They are also fine on a net-net basis if they had sold their home in a higher cost of living area because they sold their home for above asking price (most likely). Additionally, these people spent less and were likely beneficiaries of the stock market. \u200b These people, by virtue of paying all cash, cannot go \u201cunderwater\u201d on their home loans. There will be no crash for these people. Furthermore, underwriting standards and income verification standards are much stricter for debt-to-income ratio, down payments, and the income verification. So, people who get a mortgage to purchase a home will always have skin in the game. A low interest rate on mortgages will also mean you can purchase more home, for the same fixed mortgage payment. When I say fixed mortgage payment, I mean to say that most home loans are now fixed, which means that you now have no unpleasant surprises if interest rates rise. Ch 3. The Great Mortgage Originator War Is Keep Rates Low, with Continued Home Appreciation Congratulations, you got this far. So, you want to know why people can buy so much house? Well, that is partly a function of the Fed purchasing a lot of mortgage-backed securities and treasuries, as well as strong bond purchases. This has kept mortgage rates at roughly or a little below 3% for months now. With that said, the two largest mortgage originators have also been on a volume war and squeezing the wholesale mortgage market (which is highly fragmented) in the process. For the last month and a half, the largest wholesale lender (United Wholesale Mortgage) has been price matching 15 competitors.]( Rocket, in the meantime has made it\u2019s \u201cBroker Freedom Credit,\u201d which gives a 50bps discount permanent.]( While RKT and UWMC do not directly compete due to United Wholesale Mortgage\u2019s ultimatum to its brokers that if they work with RKT they cannot work with UWMC, the aggressive push for market share in this fragmented space means that margin compression will remain for a while. A pessimistic Jeffries report believes that normalization to normal gain on sale margins of roughly 150 BPS will not happen until sometime in 2023. This means rates will continue to be strong for consumers as they purchase homes for awhile yet, meaning you are doing yourselves no favors by sitting on the sidelines. To add to this, home price appreciation for 2022 is expected to moderate but still be strong. Home prices in 2022 are expected to rise by roughly 4.4% in a forecast by Freddie Mac. CoreLogic, a property data and analytics company, expects home prices to increase by 3.5%.]( Ch 4. Government Policies to Help Prospective Homeowners First the FHA is taking steps to help remove barriers to homeownership for those with student loan debt. I am going to quote the relevant portion from the announcement: \u201cThe policy updates published on Thursday evening for FHA Single Family Title II forward mortgages remove the current requirement that lenders calculate a borrower\u2019s student loan monthly payment of one percent of the outstanding student loan balance for student loans that are not fully amortizing or are not in repayment. The new policy bases the monthly payment on the actual student loan payment, which is often lower, and helps home buyers who, with student debt, meet minimum eligibility requirements for an FHA-insured mortgage.\u201d]( Secondly, with the supreme court\u2019s decision which paved the way for Mark Calabria\u2019s removal by President Joe Biden, there is a very significant chance that the adverse market fee which he had implemented will be removed. This added roughly 1,400 in costs to the average home borrower, which will likely no longer apply sooner rather than later.]( Finally, \u201cStarting on June 5, Fannie Mae will offer a product called Refi Now. Freddie Mac\u2019s version, called Refi Possible, is set to launch on August 30. Borrowers with loans backed by Fannie or Freddie and who make 80% or less than their area\u2019s median household income will qualify\u2026 The programs aim to expand refi access by lowering costs and loosening some eligibility requirements. For example, borrowers can qualify for a reduced interest rate with a credit score as low as 620 and a debt-to-income ratio as high as 65%. \u200b The FHFA estimates that qualifying homeowners could save between $1,200 and $3,000 a year \u2014 or an average of $100 to $250 each month.\u201d]( Ch 5. Forbearances are not the Armageddon. As of June 25, the forbearance rate fell below 4% for the first time in a year. There are still an estimated 2M homeowners who have a loan in forbearance, but forbearance exits picking up could mean that the U.S. economy is on its way to doing better.]( The Biden Administration has also extended the eviction moratorium and to enter forbearance through to the end of July, which the S.C. has permitted.]( The reason it did so is to allow rent relief to continue working its way down to landlords, as it has been bogged down in bureaucracy. This should mean that the impact on small time landlords will be alleviated and mute the impact of homes sold due to necessity by these small-time landlords. In the words of Brett Kavanaugh: \" those few weeks will allow for additional and more orderly distribution of the congressionally appropriated rental assistance funds.\" Chapter 6. Owning is (almost) always better than Renting. 1. Rent increases with inflation. Your mortgage will, however, even if 25 years pass. 2. Rent (unless you live in a VHCOL area) must account for the mortgage payment, homeowner insurance, HOA/Property Taxes, etcetera. As a result, it is significantly higher than a mortgage payment. And still make profit Better to buy less house now and use those savings to buy more house later. 3. You increase your own equity with every mortgage payment you make. 4. You get beneficial tax advantages, especially if you decide to rent it out when you move out later in life. 5. The only time I would not own is if when I rented out the house, I couldn\u2019t cover all the expenses and make a profit under the 1% or 2% rule. In those cases, it\u2019s better to just keep your money in the stock market and look for a job elsewhere. If you work at a place like McDonalds where the minimum wage is 15, and you live in NYC. I am sorry, you are not getting a house. Move to W. Va if you want one since the cost of living is significantly cheaper there, but the wage there at McDonalds is still 15 dollars. It sucks, but it is what it is. Ch. 6. What you can do to Buy a Home 1. Step 1: Find home purchase assistance from your local and state government. A lot of states have this, including loan assistance with low or no interest. For example, Delaware County in PA has a Homeownership First Program which offers \u201cdown payment and closing cost assistance to eligible homebuyers. The total assistance is not to exceed 5,000; this will cover up to 2 percent of the down payment of the new home.\u201d Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency also aids through a variety of programs, one of which is the HOMEstead Down payment and Closing Cost Assistance Loan. According to the PHPA: \u201cThe program provides homebuyers with up to $10,000 (and a minimum of $1,000) in down payment and closing cost assistance in the form of a no-interest, second mortgage loan. HOMEstead funds are forgiven at 20 percent per year over five. The first mortgage is provided by PHFA at the same rate as the Keystone Home Loan program.\u201d 2. Find a home that has a lower price than comparably priced homes in the neighborhood that have the same format. The reason for this could be due to bad landscaping, mismatching flooring (mixture of carpet floors and hardwood floors), terrible paintjobs, termites eating at the shingles of the roof, etcetera. You basically want to find wedge deals where the cost to fix is significantly lower than the home price appreciation by doing these fixes. There is a certain youtuber who makes a killing on this. The principle is like this: 1) Homes in the neighborhood with your potential home\u2019s configuration run at around 220K, but 2) The home you are buying is selling for 150K because of fixes that it needs for any of the things listed above. 3) The cost to improve the home runs around 5-20K, which then brings your home\u2019s value to that of your neighbors (look up what entry level things you need to do to make it an entry level home. Again, there is a youtuber for that). 4) This leaves you \u201cextra\u201d cash to outbid, if need be, up to whatever it is to be equal. Once you \u201cfix up\u201d the home, have it reappraised by the bank so that your new equity is in the house plus however much you now have in addition. This is even better if you turn this into a rental afterwards when you move to your second home. Remember to make sure that everything you buy is entry level, so you can rent it out if it makes sense to rent it out later. 3. If you need a move in ready home, get home configurations that see a lot less interest like 2 Bedroom homes, with 2 baths, etcetera. If you have two kids that are on the younger side, you can get a bunk bed for them, and they can sleep in the same room for a year or three while you build up the equity in your home and then \u201cmove up\u201d in 5 years. 4. Buy in a less desirable area, but with a low level of crime, then work your way up while building equity in your home. 5. Remember that rental properties count as income for (last I checked???) 80 percent of the rental income. If you have bought a wedge property, and then reappraised, you also likely removed PMI. 6. Remember that if you are buying a fixer upper to turn it into a rental, or a less desirable house there is less competition, and the competition you have is more likely rational as they are investors. For example, a buyer of a home who is an investor that wants to flip it must account for the 6% real estate commission cost when he flips it. 7. Alternatively, just buy a new home from one of the large home builders and realize cost savings elsewhere, to be frank.

My take is they cannot ignore the amounts of cash coming in, and a flight to value has to start some time. \\--- # IIa. Bananas Imagine it's 1990. Nirvana is rocking the charts, and you grow and sell bananas. Business is good and you're able to sustainably expand your business slowly and surely. You pay your workers well and you're not too mean to the environment. However, a new banana grower hits the scene across the world. They grow bananas with less regard for the environment and their workers. This makes their bananas cheaper to make. They ship the bananas all across the world for cheap, and rake in money. In the span of 30 years, they go from growing less bananas than you to growing almost 15x the bananas as you, and more than half of the whole world. As the price of bananas plummet, banana growers across the world suffer. They can't afford to expand, and they don't. They barely scrape a living by and the only thing that keeps them alive is their country slapping taxes on bananas imported from the evil banana empire across the world. The amount of bananas the world wants has grown, but the the only people who have increased their banana farms is the evil empire. For better or worse, the world has practically grown to rely on those cheap bananas coming in. This continues for years. Until, rather quickly, those cheap bananas stop flooding in. Yet, the appetite for bananas remains the same. What happens now? The price of bananas shoots up! In fact, it's even more extreme than this: not only has the supply of bananas vanished, and demand stayed the same -- no, the demand for bananas has skyrocketed! You see, just a year ago, everybody got sick and nobody was making bananas for awhile. Sure, less bananas were being eaten, but stockpiles of bananas still fell. Then the world got better, and people's appetites for bananas exploded. All that time with no bananas... now they want to feast on bananas! They've even decided to build bridges, buildings, cars, and appliances out of bananas! Whoa, so it's pretty awesome to make and sell bananas right now. Maybe it's time to expand your banana farms? Well, you see, that takes a lot of time, and a lot of money. It can't happen overnight. Furthermore, the last time you did this you got fucked by the evil banana empire.. so maybe this time you'll be more careful. That's where we are at right now. Huge demand for steel that will last for a long time, and supply that's not coming back for a long time. \\--- # IIb. Steel: China, and the rest of the world. This is the wrinkle version of the above section. Skip if you want. Basically the dynamics of global steel are changing, and changing rapidly. On top of that, we are seeing immense economic growth. On top of that, we are coming out of COVID (which saw lower levels of production, and caused demand to pent up). There is a lot of intersectionality going on, but it's the perfect storm for steel. ## Before: China sets the price of steel. China enjoys steel privileges, and they oppress the rest of the world's steelmakers. Look at just how much steel they manufacture: \u200b China produces a lot of steel. A lot., and 6x all of Europe combined. They also consume a fuck ton of steel. But, in the end, they're left with plenty of steel to export, which they've happily been doing. So much so, that for years they've driven the price of steel to the ground and nearly bankrupt the entire industry here in the US. They export about 15-20% of all the steel in the world that is exported. \u200b China exports a lot of cheap, dirty steel. of size 2.5 microns or less. For reference, your hair is about 50-70 microns thick. PM2.5s are habitual microaggressors and systemically oppress your lungs. Given the amount of steel China produces, the pollution is astronomical. Akin to 40 packs a day in some regions: \u200b PM2.5: Microaggressors everywhere should not just focus on performance and leave pollution to local people,\u201d said Huang (Minister of Ecology and Environment) Yeah, steel causes 15% of China's emissions and probably a much higher percent of their poor air quality. This is because not only do they produce a fuck ton of steel, but also their efficiency at producing it sucks: \u200b China produces 2.5x the amount of CO2 per ton of steel. 2. Stop exporting, so you can cut down production 3. Switch to cleaner ways of making steel ## China's walking the walk It's not just talk, China is actually doing this. First, a decree of production cutbacks. Violators are probably sent to reeducation camps or some shit. Next, removing export rebate in May (#StopAsianRebate). This makes it less profitable to export. Next, fucking with domestic commodities prices, so that steel could remain cheap just for a little bit longer. In May, they increased margin requirements for commodities traders, causing them liquidate their positions and tanking steel prices.... temporarily. Meanwhile, they're building out EAFs. They want to make less steel, they want to keep it for themselves, they want it cleaner. \\--- # III. EAFs and Scrapfirmative Action By now you see why steel is expensive, and that there's a lot of incentive for China to produce it sustainably. So let's explore how that is done. Hint: scrap metal. ## How steel is made Steel has two primary pathways to its production: \u200b BOFs on the left, EAFs on the right and EAFs (electrical arc furnaces) can take scrap as input. However, BOFs produce a lot more CO2. \u200b EAFs - the wave of the future. are moving towards EAFs 4. EAFs + Scrap are the best way to make steel. ## The future fight for scrap This whole thing about scrap is not some secret that I've discovered. It's been echoed by CEOs in the steel biz for some time now. Lourenco Goncalves, AKA \"steelmaker of the year 2021\", the guy who told GS interns to kill themselves and loves it when shorts suffer, the guy who basically laid out the entire banana story I said earlier in fucking 2016*. ## SCHN's take Meanwhile, SCHN just reported earnings last week. The babe in charge, Tamara Lundgren. ## Long Term Despite only making up 27.7% of steel production, Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) are going to be responsible for a huge surge in demand for scrap over the long run. The US, formerly the steel center of the world, has 100 years worth of high quality scrap laying around, and China doesn't. You wouldn't happen to know of any publicly traded US company with a vast network of scrap collection, technology to sort and process that scrap, and strategic export hubs to export that scrap, would you? SCHN also makes for a very juicy acquisition target, which would make sense given the recent narrative of steel consolidating in the US. # VI. That's all.

{"text": "$ORCL is currently at all time highs and is breaking out with 3% moves for the past few days. Here's a few reasons why I think this will keep going and if you do not want to miss another MSFT or AMZN, you should buy Oracle. \u200b 1. Oracle is extremely undervalued with a P/E of 19.19 as a Cloud/Software company. Usually Cloud/Software companies like Microsoft or Google have P/es in the high 30s/40s. 2. Oracle does massive stock buybacks with them announcing a 20 billion stock repurchase plan this year as well as having a dividend yield of 1.46% which is way higher than AAPL or MSFT. 3. Oracle is growing massively with 8% YoY growth from last year yet they are being priced as a boomer company 4. With the recent JEDI news being cancelled now Oracle has a shot of receiving this contract which should also boost stock price. [ 5. Stocks love round numbers. When was the last time you saw a stock at 80 or 90 and eventually never hit 100? Almost never. Stocks love to hit round numbers. 6. Options are extremely cheap on oracle with them sometimes being less than 10 cents even though the stock is at 80$ currently. This means there is alot of gamma squeeze potential with Oracle as it is extremely cheap to buy OTM options for Oracle and thus force MM's to buy shares. \u200b Tl;dr: Oracle is an extremely undervalued Cloud/ Software company that is currently breaking out right now with an extremely high chance of hitting 100 very soon. I would recommend buying calls on Oracle as they are currently very cheap with them being a few cents each for OTM calls.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-07-11 17:38:04", "id": "ohzght"}

{"text": "And, to top it off, the CCP is now discussing scrapping the Variable Interest Entity (VIE) structure through which foreign investors have \"invested\" in Chinese companies. [ (For a primer on the VIE structure and the risks it poses to American and other foreign investors looking to invest in China, see here: [ ) Wonder if American and other foreign investors will \\finally\\ get the memo with Didi here. If the CCP wanted American and foreign investors to lose the maximum right out of the gate, they could not have timed this move any better. The SEC requires publicly traded companies to disclose substantial risks to the company\u2019s operations or business. Is there any credible evidence to suggest Didi execs were completely unaware the app was at risk of an imminent shutdown when the company filed its 10-K? Someone lied. It's either the CCP or Didi itself (which, let's be honest, is likely little more than an alter ego for the CCP anyways, given the usual governmental presence required on boards and the like). This lack of reciprocity cannot continue. The US government cannot and should not let Chinese companies list here unless they meet the same disclosure requirements that American companies meet under the prevailing securities acts and implementing regulations. Foreign investors in China must have access to the Chinese courts to litigate securities fraud actions, just as happens here on the flipside in the US (recall that Huawei/CCP was able to judicially challenge the Trump Administration's proposed ban in American court). Unless and until that happens, the lesson is clear: stay away from Chinese offerings. The CCP shows once again it has absolutely no qualms about deceiving and pulling the rug on foreign investors. This is definitely part of a larger pattern of the CCP flexing on foreign investors (see here: [ [ The risk is just not worth it. [ Edit: oh, right! I forgot to mention all the widespread reverse merger scams that plagued the markets a decade ago: INB4: 1. Enron, Theranos, Your Hometown Deli, Lordstown, et al. Besides the fact Enron was decades ago, it spawned disclosure and accounting laws that American companies now must comply with. But more to the point, with respect to all of these, the US has securities fraud laws to protect investors here; if they've been injured, and lies or fraudulent statements were made, then the offending company can be haled into court to answer for it, \\including\\ by foreigners who invested in them. Theranos, like Enron, has even spawned a criminal process in addition to the civil one. Tell me: do you, as a foreigner, have the right to demand a judicial remedy in Chinese court against the CCP or a SOE for, e.g., fraudulently rugpulling the VIE structure? Do you, as a foreign investor, have the right to hale Luckin Coffee into Chinese court for securities fraud? There is no reciprocity. And that's the nub of the problem. As a foreign investor in China, you will get burned, and \\there is nothing you can do about it\\ (unlike foreign investors here in the US). 2. Ohh, silly person, China wouldn't shoot itself in the foot and injure its standing in the world by bilking foreign investors and taking all their money, leaving them high and dry. Recall the National Security Law and Hong Kong, in violation of a treaty the CCP signed. The CCP more likely envisions itself as Bruce Willis in this scene from Die Hard 4: [ . Yes, it injures itself, but it weakens or takes out its foreign competition in the process. The CCP has shown time and again it's more concerned above all else with consolidating its power. It is better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven. Edit INB4 no. 3: You and this post are racist. It\u2019s racist to point out that either the CCP or Didi is bilking investors here of all ethnicities and creeds? I think not. Moreover, this is a common wumao tactic often used on social media. They\u2019ve learned they can deflect from the CCP\u2019s misdeeds by crying any criticism of the government or enterprise is racist. Edit edit: Hell, let\u2019s go even further! Assume I am indeed a racist (I\u2019m not). How does that factually alter, rebut, or contend with the substance of anything I\u2019ve said here? Edit edit edit: INB4 no. 4: You can take Chinese companies to Chinese court for securities fraud. All right. Now consider the following: A big reason for this latest Didi fiasco is, the US demanded that Chinese companies comply with typical US disclosure requirements. And this reluctance on China's part to disclose is because of the way the government has permeated the larger companies, so it refuses based on national security grounds. Given this linkage between the state and enterprise, and given the state's preoccupation with national security, an injured foreign investor likely wouldn't be able to obtain the information in discovery needed to make his case; it would all be withheld in the interests of safeguarding information related to \"national security\". The courthouse doors may as well be shut given such flimsy process. Not so here in the US, where there is no such outright permeation of the government in publicly-traded companies. Edit Edit Edit Edit: I do not have a position in Didi--have not bought or sold a single share or contract. Edit x 5.

{"text": "UPDATE 19.07.2021. Since there was a lot of news since I originally published this post, I'm publishing it again with updated informations. # 1. WHO IS CARMAT ? CARMAT was founded by Alain Carpentier in 2008, he is known to have performed the first artificial heart implant in Europe in 1986. He is also the father of the mitral valve repair techniques. The biggest player behind this company is Airbus which co-founded it. # 2. WHO IS AESON ? Aeson was a king of Iolcus in ancient Greece but more importantly he reincarnated into the most advanced artificial heart currently on the market (UE). It\u2019s currently the only product of CARMAT. # 3. WHO IS ALCAR ? ALCAR is the ticker name on Euronext. (For retards who can\u2019t buy EU stocks go to chapter 10 ) # 4. CAN I HAVE MORE INFORMATIONS ON THIS AESON ? You need first to understand there is multiple categories for medical cardiac devices : 1. LVAD Left Ventricular Assist Device 2. RVAD Right Ventricular Assist Device 3. BiVAD Biventricular Assist Device 4. TAH Total Artificial Heart As a retard you would think that TAH is amazing and so Aeson should be category 4. This not the case. Aeson is so fucking amazingly advanced that they had to create a new category : PHRT Physiologic Heart Replacement Therapy This is the only device in this category and due to the difficulty of the task, there is no other devices which is going to be able to compete with Aeson in the near future (>10 years) So why is this AESON so fucking amazingly advanced ? 1. Pulsatility : The artificial heart mimics a real heart with 2 pumps, 2 ventricles, 4 valves. 2. Autoregulation : The embedded sensors and microprocessors allow a live response to changing patient physiological needs. (It automatically adjusts if the patient walks, runs, sleeps, etc.. ; like a real heart) 3. Hemocompatibility : All the surfaces in contact with blood are totally hemocompatible. Compared to other similar cardiac medical devices,Aeson is really safe. It is the only one which didn\u2019t provoke any stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding or infection at the cable site (This artificial heart still uses an external battery) in any of the study participants. # 5. SO CAN AESON BE USED COMMERCIALLY IN EU AND US RIGHT NOW ? Not so fast, not so fast... If it was 100% the case, the rocket would already have launched a long time ago ! There is 4 uses category for this device type : 1. BTR Bridge To Recovery 2. BTT Bridge To Transplantation 3. BTB Bridge To Bridge 4. DT Destination Therapy The final target is DT ( Destination Therapy ), which means that the heart is going to be used as a permanent implant. In December 2020, Carmat received CE marking for BTT. It means that it can be used, for now, as a temporary solution for patients which can receive real \u2764\ufe0f transplantation but are still on the waiting list. Carmat, genius as they are, will also use the data from BTT patients to push for the DT. The first commercial implants are going to be in Germany in Q2 2021 as they are ready to reimburse it. UPDATE : FIRST COMMERCIAL IMPLANT WAS SOLD AND IMPLANTED IN ITALY IN JULY 2021 In parallel, another study (EFICAS) is starting in France in Q2 2021 to drive Aeson adoption, support the value proposition and mainly to get French reimbursement. In the US, They are starting the EFS (Early Feasibility Study) in Q1 2021 (now). 3 centers in the US are already trained and ready to implant their first patients. UPDATE : FIRST EFS IMPLANTATION IN US DONE IN JULY 2021 # 6. OK COOL ! BUT WHAT IS THE MARKET SIZE ? Currently the EU market for BTT is estimated to be of a minimum size of 2000 patients / year. Right now Germany is the focus as it represents 40% of the EU market (800). France is following with 14% of the market (280). The competitors did less than 60 interventions in Germany and France last year on this type of patient (BVAD / Syncardia). Which is showing that the market is currently without any real competition as the concurrent products aren\u2019t really as convincing which explains their small volumes. The combined EU-US market for DT is estimated to be around 180\u2019000 / year. On these 180\u2019000 patients, around 3.3% are getting a real heart transplantation each year which is around 5\u2019500. Which gives a market size of 174\u2019500. The market size is also growing each year for multiple reason : Ageing of population (boomers dying) The fatness of fat people is becoming more prevalent. (not fat shaming intended) The number of real \u2764\ufe0f transplants could soon slow down as there will be less car accidents with new autopilots system (thanks daddy elon). An estimated 33% of all organ transplants come from deadly traffic collisions. # 7. BUT CAN CARMAT PRODUCE ALL THESE HEARTS ? Carmat finished building its first factory in France last year. It will be soon able to produce 800 \u2764\ufe0f/ year. As we see the current EU BTT market is large enough for this first factory. UPDATE : CURRENTLY PRODUCING 10\u2764\ufe0f/month -> 20\u2764\ufe0f/month as a target for end 2021. The timing is really good as they will be able to optimize and streamline the industrialization and production process before the CE destination therapy marking and the BBT / DT FDA approval. With the EU BTT market and current production capabilities, Carmat can partially finance the future studies, it\u2019s development needs and new factories. This can prevent too much share dilution. It is possible that for future factories in the US, Carmat could partner up with a big name (Edwards, Medtronic, Abbott, Johnson & Johnson, Boston Scientifics, etc... ). A partnering would give Carmat more credibility and a bigger commercial strike force in Uncle Sam Country. # 8. LET\u2019S SPEAK $$ / REVENUES / VALUATION (QUALITY MATH ECONOMICS TIME ) SOURCES OF REVENUES The 2 main sources of revenues for CARMAT are going to be : Sales of Aeson : The first AESON was sold in Italy this month (JULY 2021) for 200'000 euros or $235'000 Aeson maintenance : They can be conservatively estimated to be around $10\u2019000/year REVENUES ESTIMATES Short term revenues estimates, I am going to use the future production capabilities of the current factory -> 800 \u2764\ufe0f per year. I won\u2019t be using the maintenance revenues as in the short term only BTT category is used. Medium term revenues estimates, I\u2019m going to use a pessimistic 5% market share.

SARTORIUS P/S = 13 (4 FEB 2021) ABIOMED P/S = 18 (4 FEB 2021) From This let\u2019s take a pessimistic starting P/S of 12 for our beloved CARMAT My advance prediction model also predict a lowering P/S when the company gets bigger. (Because most of the times the growth is slowing(which wouldn\u2019t necessary be the case for carmat\u2026 but whatever)) -> I thereby announce a pessimistic -2 P/S for each row in the following table (for big brain people : P/S = ((7-n)\\2) |TIME REFERENCE|MATH|VALUATION| |:-|:-|:-| |SHORT TERM|$188M \\ 12(P/S)|$2.25B| |MID TERM|$2.5B \\ 10(P/S)|$25B| |LONG TERM 1|$7.1B \\ 8(P/S)|$57B| |LONG TERM 2|$15B \\ 6(P/S)|$90B| SO HOW MUCH MY SHARES WILL BE WORTH ? Currently there is 15.3M shares each worth $30 (19 JULY 2021) for a total ridicul valuation of 390M There was some share dilution early 2021.

OK I SMELL TENDIES ! BUT WHAT ELSE ? The US EFS won\u2019t cost a dime as carmat will get paid for each used \u2764\ufe0f. The margin on medical devices is huge (Stefan Piat (CARMAT CEO) is targeting 70% \ud83d\ude80 ) The market size I used only takes into account the current AESON which by its size can\u2019t fit into your wife's chest neither in her asian boyfriend chest.

BUT THE STOCK IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN EUROPOOR... Stocks in europoor are worldwide famous for having a low valuation. Which is in fact a good occasion to get it before it comes to the US where valuation is without any known limits (\ud83d\ude80) ! When asked about a NASDAQ introduction, Stefan Piat answered (6.jan 2021): \u201dIt makes a lot of sense, it really is on the table\u201d . # 11. BUT I NEVER INVEST IN BIOTECH COMPANIES WHICH STILL NEED AUTHORIZATIONS FOR THEIR PRODUCT ! It\u2019s true that investing in small biotech companies is not for small balls investors. But if you followed carefully (which you didn\u2019t), you would have understood that even in the improbable event that Carmat can\u2019t have the DT (again really improbable, more a question of when), my model shows that Carmat would still be worth more than 36$ a share solely on taking into account the EU BTT market. # 12. LAST WORD It is important to understand that, currently, only 25 to 45% of the 180\u2019000 yearly potential patients are surviving more than one year without the Aeson. It is not a comfort medical device, it is a necessity for all these people. There is no real competition and there won\u2019t be before a long time. This product is the result of more than 12 years of research and studies made by worldwide specialists. In my opinion, it is really hard to see Karma(t) not succeed in the next few years. # 13.

The $27billion capital raise in March combined with 1Q 2021 results and its updated investment plan makes me more constructive, although the risks around execution and the legacy linear bundle do keep me worried. VIAC ended 1Q2021 with 22x net leverage. This is the lowest level in years and gives it the flexibility to put more capital into its streaming business without stretching the balance sheet. While the streaming revenue growth has been healthy, I expect it to accelerate in the second quarter. Paramount Plus shifted to a lower priced $4.99 price point in June and launches more international lower ARPU streaming markets, which may weigh on DTC ARPU later in the year. Finally, while cord-cutting and licensing are areas of earnings risk, the advertising backdrop overall is strong which provides some down side protection. Streaming expectations based on experts I've researched suggest ViacomCBS to end 2021 with 47 mm DTC subscribers globally and 64-65 mm Pluto MAUs. 2021 global streaming revenue estimates of $4.17bn, with growth of -63% YoY. Looking to 2024, expectations are 74 mm DTC subscribers and streaming revenues of $7.4bn. I would argue one quarter is not enough to materially alter the markets view. I do like the stock and thing it can only go up from here. This is not financial advice because I'm pretty much retarded.

(And I'm heavy long in this stock) As I told you in last post about wish (\"Wish Update\" and \"Wish Technical analysis\") we had a a big ressitance at 15, and two supports, EMA20 (1hr) and the uptrend line See first on 10min chart: As you can see, WISH touched the uptrend line twice today, with a false breakdown nearly the close. So, we are still in the uptrend \u200b About the 1hr chart and his EMA20, I presented as a good strategy for those who are day-traders use the EMA20 (1hr) as a buy or sell indicator (depends of we are above or below). And it worked well. I re-bought all my shares today early around 13.30/13.40 after wish touched the uptrend and rebound from there because I'm very confident about his future. All the facts we mentioned on \"$WISH Fundamentals\" and \"$WISH New Catalyst\" are still here. And the volume during this little downtrend is very low comparing with the last month. We only traded today the 67% of the 30 Day Average Volume. Clearly this is not a panic scenario or something like that. As I read from a guy on Twitter, dips are healthy, and it's true. Dips give the opportunity to other traders to jump in the stock, so, don't be scared when stocks goes down a few dollars. I know that all of us were waiting for a big break on USD 15 resistance and we couldnt. Altough that, Setup is very bullish and I think this a good entry for those who were waiting an oppportunity.I hope a very little weakness tomorrow at open, with a very bullish close. Market are experienced some volatility and that's the reason I dont see a extremely bullish flow at open. But once we touch the uptrend again, I think we will see it. 12.50 is my stop loss, Large stop loss because I distrust of downtrends with low volume, usually are bear traps.

In my post history you\u2019ll definitely find me shilling for CLOV. Stupid piece of shit CLOV. Turns out, you\u2019ll find most of these stocks are shorted FOR A REASON. THEY SUCK ASS. THINK YOU DAMN APES, THINK. AMC and GME actually did squeeze. But those are RARE exceptions. And they totally poisoned this sub with a bunch of Neanderthals looking for the next short squeeze. Stop. Get help. It feels like we\u2019ve had 5 years worth of short squeezes in the last few months. It\u2019s over. Why should you listen to a random nobody yelling at you on the internet? Because. People are making money out there while you baghold these crap stocks. SPY at an all time high. You coulda made more $$ playing Microsoft or Apple. Or actually, don\u2019t stop. Lose your money please. And then fuck off to your lonely 9-5 daily cocksucking for that $500 weekly paycheck. And never come to this sub again. So I don\u2019t have to read your bullshit.

Here\u2019s the difference- AMC and GME are household names. If you want retail to pile on? It\u2019s gotta be a household name. Retail loves nostalgia. They love familiarity. So is it a retail squeeze, or can you get the big bois on board? Here\u2019s some facts for ya- they don\u2019t need your shit DD. They have Bloomberg Terminals. They have 100x more data than we do, and they see it before we do, in real time, and they play market rotations and earnings. They\u2019re not googling 1 week old short interest data. They got the real time shit. They play this game on another level. And if you can\u2019t get them on board, and the stock isn\u2019t a household name, then you fucked up. So this is what I\u2019m saying- I blame all you fucks for missing plays like NKE last week. Come on. NKE was a fucking given. It was written on the wall in neon letters and most of us missed it. TL;DR- want to make money? You can be a millionaire without ever touching a short squeeze. Fucking rookie ass bitches.

I also got a Reddit admin notice asking if I need mental health help lmao. Got a good chuckle out of that one. Fucking trolls.

In August Bayer AG will file for a review the U.S supreme court. If the US supreme court accepts the review, the stock could move 30% just on that, and probably another 100% if the supreme court decides in favor of Bayer.

{"text": "TLDR: If you like free money - buy XLNX and wait. For context, AMD announced Xilinx acquisition in october last year: [ The acquisition is an all-stock deal, which means for every Xilinx stock you will get exactly 1.7234 of AMD stock after the merger is completed. The merger is planned to be completed by the end of the year, and it has been reiterated during 2 of the previous earning calls. \u200b # What is there to gain? AMD stock is trading today at $112. Xilinx today is trading at $146. This means a ratio of 1.30 instead of 1.7234. Buying Xilinx you are buying AMD stocks for $85 after merger happens. This is 30% upside of free monies. \u200b # What is there to lose? If AMD/XILINX deal doesn't go through, XLNX will most likely jump straight back to pre-merger announcement territory, it will probably end up around $110-$115. \u200b # What could stop the merger from happening? There are several regulators that have to approve merger. Most of the important ones already did: [ However it hasn't been approved by China yet: [ The moment China approves the deal, Xilinx stock will jump very close to 1.7234 multiple of AMD (and possibly drag AMD down a bit, however merger approval is good news for AMD as well). \u200b # What are the chances China does not approve of the deal? Of course it's a gamble with high US-China tensions, but let's take a look at some facts. In 2019 Chinese antitrust committee reviewed 465 deals. It approved all of them (!!). [ In 2020 they reviewed 458 deals. Out of all of them, they rejected a single one (DouYu merger with Huya, both Chinese companies). [ This means only one rejection out of 923 deals! Nvidia purchased Mellanox in 2020 and it was conditionally approved through China. This is equivalent of AMD/XLNX deal. AMD owns ATI, which was started by Chinese Canadians. Both Xilinx and AMD are US based. They already have heavy business connections with China. I'm not bold enough to estimate the odds, but the facts suggest they're quite high! \u200b # If this is such a good deal, why is nobody else buying XLNX? They were, but had to cover their shorts! The most common way to play XLNX/AMD merger is to go short AMD and long XLNX, and that's what most investors did. However, with recent magnificient AMD run up after Q2 earnings call they were forced to cover their short positions as they became too expensive to hold till the merger. And I have proof that prices were closely correlated until very recently, let's take a look at this XLNX/AMD ratio graph: [ Up until very recently the deal was oscilating within 1.5-1.6 area and after recent AMD run up it's been lagging strongly behind. Unless there's some hidden factor major investors know about but not common folks, this is literally the best time in history to buy XLNX to convert into AMD after the merger. \u200b Positions: XLNX leaps, XLNX stock, AMD stock", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-08-04 01:51:53", "id": "oxf19e"}

Simply - PBF now making approx. $3.5-4M extra per day (with 90% of max 1000 bpd production) in comparison to Q2 2021. \u2022 Revenue for Q2 is $6.9B - keep increasing \u2022 EPS for Q3 likely to be positive for the first time since 2020 even the spread will down to $20-22 \u2022 Production rates will keep increasing form 90% to approx 93% in Q3 due to petroleum consumption. It will not hit above 95% since all yearly maintenance work going on May-September period. CRACK321 2016 - 2021. But this situation will change soon since 2 things will happen: 1.

More than 15% of float shares in short (seen the data for July, 15 - now the persentage of shorts should be higher).

Thats could be: \u2022 US/Canada, US/Mexico land borders opening // US/EU regular flights increasing \u2022 $1T infrastructure bill \u2022 RINs regulation relief - the most desirable Bought 2k shares and will buy all-in up to 10k between $12-16. Target - $22-24. If it become a meme - shares can rise up to $28-30. Not the worst opportunity to apply your YOLO** philosophy. Funds can be doubled within 4-6 weeks, just wait any positive release.

Yes, Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to $75, but even going off that price target, the lowest price target out, the the stock is still slightly undervalued. If you look at the average price target the stock has at least 50% upside. In fact, there is not a single firm that recommends sell on MU. MU is ridiculously cheap right now with a price to book ratio of 2, and forward PE of 6. The reason Morgan Stanley cited in their downgrade was reduced DRAM prices as well as a projected over supply of DRAM by the end of Q4. But do you know what else is on the horizon in the coming months? DDR5. In case you are not familiar with RAM, DDRx refers to the generation of the memory, with each generation having more capacity and being faster than the last. Micron is set to start mass production of DDR5 later this year. Of course DDR4 prices will start to decline. DDR5 Is almost here. Many people also argue that DRAMs are a commodity and no one really cares about who makes the chips. While that is true, there are only 3 manufactures. Samsung, Hynix, and Micron with Micron being the only one based in the USA. The DRAM business is an Oligarchy, all members of which are keenly aware not to overproduce memory in order to keep the tendy train rolling. DRAM demand is also projected to explode next year as a result of a number of factors. 5g inferstucture, automotive, cell phones, and of course computers all need DRAMs. This is of course is one reason why MU only has a forward PE of 6. They are projected to make a ton of money next year. In my 5 years working for a RAM distribution company. RAM volume always goes up during the fall as a result of Holiday demand. Guess what?

{"text": "\u201cAugust 12, 2021 10:57 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Long Ideas Clover Health (NASDAQ:CLOV) is under r/WallStreetBets\u2019 spotlight again after printing second-quarter earnings. The Medicare advantage provider reported a whopping $412 million in revenue, more than double the consensus estimate of $205.4 million. Clover was soaring 20% toward the $10 mark early Thursday morning. Although Clover respectably printed a blowout quarter, and the share price could go much higher due to that, the stock also has bizarre characteristics that have helped to make it a short squeeze candidate in the past. Between June 7 to July 9 Clover Health soared about 205% from $9.35 to an all-time high of $28.85. Like GameStop Corporation (NYSE:GME) back in January, Clover\u2019s underlying statistics appeal to retail traders looking to squeeze short sellers: Small Float: Clover has a relatively small float of just 112.38 million shares. Ownership Levels: Clover has an unbelievable 119.64% of its float tied up in the hands of insiders and institutions with 95.06% of its shares held by institutions and 24.58% by insiders. Short Interest: 25.26 million shares, meaning 22.47% of its total float, is held short although this number has dropped from 35.89 million in June. See Also: How to Buy Clover Health Stock The Clover Health Chart: After Clover\u2019s parabolic run in June the stock sold off over 72% and found a bottom at the $7.84 mark. For the past 20 trading days, Clover has held above the level and traded in a tight sideways pattern under $8.99. There has been low volume in Clover\u2019s stock during the sideways trading, indicating a lack of both sellers and buyers. Often when a security\u2019s volume drops off for an extended period of time, either huge bearish or bullish volume comes in to break it from the sideways pattern. Clover closed Wednesday just below the eight-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) with the eight-day EMA trending below the 21-day, which is bearish. If Clover trades above the $8.70 area on Thursday it will be above both commonly followed EMAs and the short-term sentiment will be bullish. The 200-day simple moving average (SMA), which is a tool used to measure overall sentiment in a stock, is at about the $10.50 area. If Clover trades below the SMA, overall sentiment is bearish; if the stock is able to clear the level, the sentiment will shift to bullish.\u201d In other words. CLOV to fucking space.

{"text": "This is not investing advice. All thoughts are my own. Do your own due diligence before investing. The e-commerce theme has been good to us ordinary retail investors who have been all over the usual suspects. AMZN and SHOP have been spectacular. Industrial warehouse REITs like PLD have been beasts. PYPL is killing it. Even old school retailers like WMT owe their resurgence in part to its pivot towards e-commerce. Shopping is moving online and that is not changing anytime soon. But the old e-commerce names have a lot of this good news baked in already. GXO is a brand new name and still seems like its flying under the radar - literally it just got spun out of XPO. Not sure why but the spin out has not been received as much airtime as I would have thought. Part of this is that spin-outs are not as flashy as IPOs but still. Given GXO is a unique pure play on e-commerce I would have anticipated more noise but its hardly been talked about. The uniqueness of the business is worth talking about because it operates in a somewhat niche area of warehouse outsourcing where its hi-tech capabilities (automation expertise) differentiate it materially from the smaller players. Basically big companies with growing e-commerce businesses go to GXO to outsource their logistics to them. GXO works with their clients to identify warehouses, leases those warehouses and then brings in their expertise to manage the asset for the client through the introduction of appropriate automation. GXO are experts in tech-enabled logistics. They are not an industrial real estate play like PLD. They are the experts in squeezing the most efficiency out of each square foot of warehouse space on behalf of their customers. TAM is massive. Right now the company only represents approx. 5% of the outsourced logistics market which the company estimates is $130bn TAM. Through M&A they will grow that slice of the pie (more on that in the catalysts section). The bigger TAM opportunity is the $300bn of currently insourced logistics. Think big box retailers currently owning their own warehouses, managing their own shipping and returns, dealing with the associated HR burden and trying to figure out how to automate the whole thing (not their specialty). These big box retailers are realizing that in order to grow fast they can outsource all of this to experts like GXO, which frees up capital and time and effort to focus on their core businesses. The stock has done well post the spin off last week but here are some catalysts to look forward to: 1) Research coverage. Expect analysts to be writing about this stock soon as it can not be ignored. What will be interesting is how the analysts value this company vs other e-commerce facilitators because it is currently in a league of its own. 2) M&A. The company has said it needed its own balance sheet to pursue inorganic growth and now it has that. Lots of fragmentation means consolidation opportunities. 3) New business wins. The company said its pipeline is the highest its ever been.

{"text": "\ud83d\udcf7 Below I will detail a trade I took earlier this week in Nucor (NUE). The name showed up on my Sunday scan. It was caught in a filter with several other names that were showing bullish price position and consolidation. Both \u201cbullish\u201d price position\u201d and \u201cconsolidation\u201d have strict definitions. The narrative would explain that positive remarks regarding the infrastructure bill could have a bullish impact on material / Construction companies and related industries. I can say honestly that I was not aware of any of it, and this trade was signal based and systematically executed. It is impossible for any one trader to be an expert in every field. Analysts spend careers specializing in focused areas; oil, metals, retail etc. traders are free to do anything they like, but personally I can\u2019t see the fun in reading articles and snooping out the best opportunities. I spend my energy studying supply and demand, and when you specialize in that you can apply the principles you learn to any market in the world. I trade breakout patterns on stocks showing relative strength or weakness vs the market in both the long and short direction. I trade the under currents. \ud83d\udcf7 \u200b After setting alerts on all the interesting setups over the weekend my job was to wait for them to trip. At about 945 the alert for NUE went off as it broke out of the above illustrated consolidation pattern, and I set my order. I got a decent price and it started off as an average trade. I do not recall if the news came out the day I entered or the next, but the real move started on 8/10 where it made a new all-time high (ATH). My strategy is to play one entry and one exit, and to adjust my stop either passively or aggressively based on the price action the Stock displays. \ud83d\udcf7 The price action on both 8/10 and 8/11 allowed me to be aggressive with my trail adjusting my stop tight to the action guaranteeing a fair profit and protecting against a big pull back. The downside of this will be if the stock were to pull back and then re-rip, but in tracking my statistics I found that this exit strategy remains optimal over thousands of trades so, I follow it strictly. My stop was eventually hit on 8/12 where I collected a 3.2R profit with very little effort. NUE is still running and currently it looks like there is .3R on the table if it were to reverse on Monday. \ud83d\udcf7 If it opens strongly on the next session, there is the potential that the top is much higher. This was a systematic and very technical trade and in writing it I find myself bored with its description (I apologize to the reader). I find that funny because I am always excited when putting on new trades, my focus is at 100% and my senses are heightened when I\u2019m playing the game. In reading this out loud I am realizing why so many \u201ctouters\u201d pumpers and gurus put a huge song and a dance with their moves (especially on TV). The truth is, and I am not original in saying this, the news is for sales, TV is for entertainment. The best systems are the simplest and would not make must watch TV. By tying a story or believing too much in a stock you create a handicap, you are trying to quantify emotions and feelings, as humans we are very, very bad at that. You need to be the right mix of a human and a robot. \ud83d\udcf7 \u200b The 6 components of my trades: Scan process Alert / plan Alert fielding Order execution Stop placement Trade management Each of these factors are very systematic and detailed and I could talk about them for hours in depth.

They had earnings this week and I was surprised to see different EPS beats and misses and different numbers all around so I took a dive into the stock and the whole \"gaming\" market. \u200b At first, lets take a look at the chart: What we can see is the stock has been sidetrading and consolidating for a while in the first months of 2021. Then may happened and a nearly 45% bullrun happened. Why? Well their Earnings in mid may were very strong, they were finishing the sale of a part of their company that wasn't really profitable in italy. That sale finally happened in Q2 btw. We saw a run form $18 to $26! \ud83d\udcb8 \ud83d\udcb8 The stock retraced back to $19 right now, which is crazy. Most of that propably on covid fears and unrelated to the business. Let's talk about earnings. Q2 Earnings were a bit wild, because with the sale of a part of the italy business, they created a humongous income that pushed their GAAP-EPS to fucking $1.49. Now obviously they won't sell off parts of their company every quarter, so that is a number that won't hold. What is important though is the fact they paid 700mil of debt in Q2 alone! \u200b taken from their Q2 presentation, while insiders (mainly B&D Holding SpA, aka the owner of $IGT) hold over 51% of the shares outstanding. 90% of the shares outstanding are held by insiders or institutions!** \u200b That means that the effective free float would be just about 20 million shares. That's incredibly low and makes the stock very sensitive to movement. Hence the 45% bullrun in may. \u200b ownership \\- Gamblers will always gamble, no matter if they do it online or live \\- $IGT will and did profit by the increased positive sentiment ($PENN for example) \\- they are a possible buyout target \\- their free float is extremely low with most of the stock held by insiders and institutions! \u200b Positions: a ton of 01/2022 22c 01/2022 20c 09/17 20c", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-08-06 11:42:48", "id": "oz2qao"}
{"text": "At the bottom please find a link to a webinar that Mat gave this past week that was widely circulated on StockTwits today by other parties. In it he mentions that UWM's gain on sale margins were in the \"mid-to-low 80s.\" Meaning 0.80-0.85%. They dropped margins because they can still be profitable at those levels and it would SQUEEZE THE SHIT out of all other lenders in the wholesale channel. Picture a shaved headed Tom Hanks with an earring, squeezing oranges. Remember Mat said on the Q1 ER Call: \"And so we think 75 to 110 this quarter -- part of that is even tied to some of the acquisition concept that we discussed or I talked about, which was understanding that we could acquire someone and spend money or we can organically do it by lowering price a little bit and acquiring their clients, their brokers. But my point is 75 to 110 is what I'm guiding towards, and I feel confident about that number. And I also feel confident that we're going to grow our market share. And if we decide to ease off on the margins, everyone else will as well, and we will continue to succeed and grow. We can acquire companies with cash and stock, or we can acquire companies and acquire business with margin compression. But remember, our cost to originate is substantially lower than everybody else's, and it gives us a major competitive advantage. And as I said earlier, I feel really good about where we sit right now in this quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter and a lot of opportunity to grow at UWM. And then when we're as large as we are and we take the time to take more margin, then the profits come flowing through, as you saw in the third, fourth quarter and even in the first quarter.\" Then Tim Forrester drop the big bomb: \"When I look at first quarter results, 53 basis points is what we calculate as our expense all in. 33 basis points was fixed. 20 was variable.\" *UWM CAN BE PROFITABLE AT ANY MARGIN ABOVE 53 BPS. 0.53%! HOLY F\\CK! In response to UWM's lowered margins, the other lenders (LoanDepot, Rocket etc.) had to drop their margins in order to compete. Notice that LDI only could go as low as 1.32% whereas RKT went down to 1.16%. They could only go that low because their bloated costs make those price points the lowest they are able to go before they lose money. UWM FINDS THEIR MAX PAIN*. HOWEVER, with the lowest cost to originate UWM is still profitable enough to MAKE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, CAPTURE MARKETSHARE. When WS realizes that the company that is in charge of how much margin ALL MORTGAGE LENDERS can make is UWM and that other companies all have to follow UWM's lead, big things will happen. As Mat said: \"Yes, we are the leader, without question. People will follow us up or down the price ladder, if you think of it that way*.\" I call right here and right now that when UWMC reports and the Street sees their volume and the lengths to which UWMC will go to get that volume (slashing their margins) while still being profitable, the question of \"Where did LDI and RKT's volume go?\" will be answered and RKT AND LDI'S stocks will drop.

{"text": "Himax overview: - Fabless semiconductor company based in Taiwan - The main product consists of display drivers, basically the chip that runs a computer screen. They also provided the LCoS display for the original Google Glass in 2013, which is why yahoo finance lists it alongside AR plays. - 2000 employees. More than 90% are engineers. 3000 patents. - Market cap: $2.4B - Share price: $13.92 - PE (ttm): 11.0 - Forward PE (for 2022): 8.6, but this assumes that the chip shortage is over in 2022 The automotive chip shortage was rather prominent in the news a few months ago but is still ongoing. The shortage is specifically due to the lack of display drivers. Himax controls 30% of the global market share for automotive display drivers. They expect the situation to be dire until 2023: Being fabless is not an issue as we can see from the EPS history: - Q2 2020: $0.01 - Q3 2020: $0.07 - Q4 2020: $0.20 - Q1 2021: $0.38 - Q2 2021: $0.62 And they expect up to $0.81 ($0.69 non-GAAP) for Q3. The EPS growth is due to higher gross margins, from 20% to almost 50% in a year. (Due to the shortage, they cannot exactly grow by selling more. They are selling everything they have.) These margins are not solely due to the chip shortage but also by focusing on more lucrative segments, e.g. tablets instead of smartphones. They have 60% market share for non-iOS tablet TDDIs. TDDI is a combination of display driver and touch controller, so you only need one chip instead of two to get a touch screen. The last big share price movement was after the Q4 2020 results. It has been oscillating ever since. Even the Q2 earnings beat and the excellent guidance had zero effect on the share price. To put things into perspective, the latest EPS of AMD were $0.63 and the AMD share price is $110. So Himax has some room to run. It will most likely overtake AMD in terms of EPS in the next quarter. They serve different markets though, so the standards are a bit different. Competitors: - Samsung. PE of 17 and there is no room for growth anyway. Is a customer of Himax for tablet TDDIs. - Novatek. Only traded in Taiwan. PE of 15. Five times the market cap of Himax but extremely similar overall. Share price is 10% up since announcing their earnings a week ago. - SiliconWorks / LX Semicon. Only traded in South Korea. Market cap of $1.76B. PE might be around 18. - Raydium. Only traded in Taiwan. I have no idea about their financial situation because IR is not in English. - Synaptics. PE of 20. They just beat earnings and went up 16.5%. Both Novatek and Synaptics went up quite a bit after their earnings and both are less profitable than Himax. The chip shortage affects them pretty much in the same way, so we can see that Himax is a safer deal than its peers. Why Himax will likely remain very profitable after the chip shortage is resolved: - There is a shift in demand towards segments with high margins. Higher resolution and higher refresh rates require more complex chips which can be sold for more. In the grand scheme of things, these chips are still very cheap (around $1 per chip) so display manufacturers are willing to pay a dollar extra if they can sell their 240 Hz 8K TV for an extra $1000. - Their TDDI technology is a clear winner in the automotive segment. They say \"The number of awarded projects is already in the dozens and still growing quickly as we speak. We expect the TDDI volume to expand exponentially starting from this quarter.\" Their overall automotive market share is increasing. So even if they have to sell each chip for less after the shortage, they can make up for it in volume. They are fabless and their biggest fixed cost are the employees, so by selling more they can keep up the profits. - Electric vehicles typically come with more displays than ICE vehicles, so the overall demand is getting larger as well. It is not even clear whether the shortage will be resolved any time soon. Work-from-home demand will probably go down, but then again the demand shifts towards more sophisticated displays with increased resolution and refresh rates. A chip that handles 240 Hz refresh rate is bigger than a 60 Hz chip. And the total foundry capacity is still limited. From the earnings call: - \"Some design requires more sophisticated design, i.e., larger IC per panel. So we believe the demand in terms of wafer area will increase. We actually, based on internal estimates, the supply can actually decrease somehow.\" - \"The fact is that the industry, overall, there is simply no new major capacity expansion this year and next year or even second half 2023\" So demand is increasing, effective supply is decreasing, there is almost no capacity coming online before 2024 and what happens afterwards is still unknown.

{"text": "As of the press time, $MNSO fell 3.16% to $14.1. MINISO is a Japanese-inspired lifestyle product retailer, offering high-quality household goods, cosmetics, and food at affordable prices. The company was founded in 2013 with the headquarter in Guangzhou, China. By the end of March, the company has opened 4,587 stores in 94 countries and regions, including the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Spain, UAE, India, and Mexico. It was listed on New York Stock Exchange on October 15, 2020. The original mission of MINISO is to release the pressure on youth and improve the quality of their lives. With the slogan of \u201ca better life has nothing to do with the price\u201d, the company is committed to providing affordable products for the young. There are three core principles on which the company is based: Affordable High Quality, which means guiding decisions from design to materials; Joy, referring to the response its customers experience while in MINISO stores; and Lighthearted, which refers to the relaxed and happy feeling when encountering the large variety of goods available. Giving great priority to the original design, the company has established the MINISO Design Academy (MDA) and teamed up with some of the best designers from Finland, Denmark, Norway, Spain, and South Korea to create high-quality products. Besides, the company has collaborated with world-famous brands including Coca Cola, Marvel, Hello Kitty, Sesame Street, Mickey and Minnie, Pink Panther, We Bare Bears, and Beijing\u2019s Palace Museum, launching diverse products which have gained great popularity all over the world. According to $MNSO\u2019s financial report in Q3 2021FY, the revenue was RMB2.229 billion, with a YoY increase of 36.51%; the net growth was RMB356.5 million, with a YoY increase of 18.54%. Business model: to open chain stores Two parties of the model are the MINISO company and its franchisees. All the operating costs are paid by the franchisees, while the decoration, stocking, and management of the new store are taken care of by the company itself. In another word, MINISO is GP (General partner), who just manages but do not invest money, and the franchisees are LP (Limited Partner), who only contributes money and get a monthly dividend. The company gets money from several channels. First, when a new store joins the chain, it must offer the brand fee to the company. Then the franchisees have to deliver the goods deposit when joining the chain and the goods are all supplied by the MINISO, which is another big income because both in preparation and in operation, a steady supply of goods is needed. Finally, If the franchisee opens and operates well, MINISO can take dividends together, and if it loses money or even closes down, the company pays nothing but earns the franchise fee. Recent moves: On June 23, MINISO established a cross-border e-commerce company, with a registered capital of RMB10 million, and its business scope includes stationery supplies wholesale, shoes and hats wholesale and retail, investment activities with own funds, auto parts retail, import and export of goods, etc. On June 28, MINISO has undergone industrial and commercial changes, the registered capital increased from RMB 300 million to RMB 600 million, an increase of 100%. At the same time, the business scope added natural science research and experimental development, information system operation and maintenance services, and investment activities with its own funds. In July, MINISO has committed to donating RMB5 million of emergency supplies to aid the disaster relief operations in central China's Henan province, after a severe flood caused by extremely heavy rainfall in the region. In response to the crisis, MINISO organized staff, mainly including bottled water and convenience food, to dispatch relief supplies from six warehouses across the country to support those in most immediate need.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-08-13 10:23:06", "id": "p3ilac"}
{"text": "I know for some of you, you are new to the PLTR game. After the recent run up yesterday, I know a few of you probably FOMO'd in around 25.76 and I personally thank you. Yoloing your Wendy Tendie's and allowance into a stock you know nothing about is normal sane behavior. Here I will be short and sweet in explaining WTF PLTR actually does. \u200b Picture you're high AF watching LOTR and the munchies hit you HARD. You go to to refrigerator to see what you have. You open the fridge and you have a lot of food but can't figure out what you want to make. Now, let's pretend you have a friend named Alex that has immaculate hair, wears workout clothes exclusively and has a barn in New Hampshire. Alex can tell you everything you have in the refrigerator, the freezer, the pantry and even the vegetables that are ready in your wife's shitty little garden. They are in separate places and you're way too lazy to be walking around everywhere. Luckily Alex brings it all together. Alex could track costs, expiration dates, quality, quantity and anything else you could imagine relating to this food. Alex could also give you a list of recipes based on the food (data) that you have or any of these other factors. Eventually Alex would get so good at this, he could tell you what you want to eat when you open the fridge. He would know you better than your wife's boyfriend knows her cervix. \u200b Alex is so smart, he constantly thinks of ways to help you except when he's swimming, playing Qigong or performing sexual activities. Alex is dedicated and he is the one you want to help you make this essential decision. Your friend Alex's last name is Karp and he is the CEO of Palantir. The service he is providing you is what Palantir offers. This service is scalable, meaning it doesn't matter if you have 1 fridge or 42,069, it will still work. You might be OK at looking through one fridge, but you know damn well you can't look through multiple fridges high AF. None of these boomer companies can efficiently look through all these fridges either, that's why they hire PLTR. \u200b Positions 115 - PLTR Feb 18 2022 21C 1110 shares \u200b P.S. Palantir is the name of the company that has the stock ticker PLTR, in case you were confused.

On Sept 3rd, Shang Chi will be released exclusively to theaters and NOT Disney plus. Disney is losing significant amount of movie going direct to streaming and they know it. WB is going back to direct theater release at the end of 2021/early 2022. 2.) Studios are creating movies with 200M+ budgets. Black Widow-200M, S. Squad-175M. The numbers don't make sense if they're NOT able to draw customers to the theaters due to PIRACY/Streaming. Scarlett Johansson/Paramount/Disney/WB know this is not sustainable. The exclusive theatrical window has been negotiated by WB to shrink from 90 to 45 days in Jan 2022. 3.) The \"variant\" and reopening sentiment derailed theater stocks like CINEMARK, IMAX, Marcus the last few months. Expect a mean reversion play once cases start to decline. (This is the time to buy not in a few months). 4.) CNK 1.8B market cap vs AMC 17B market cap. CNK can easily double. Gross BOX OFFICE Revenues- Jul21- 583M Jul20- 8M Jul19- 1.2B Revenues are still down big from 2019 but nature is starting to heal giving you an opportunity to buy low before the crowd figures it out. 5.) You're buying for next year, not for TODAY'S numbers. 2021 is a transition year with the industry recovery kicking into gear in the second half of the year, which is loaded with blockbusters. 2022 will be close to back to normal with mega movies and giant franchisees fresh remakes and spin-offs that will have massive consumer appeal. Expected Revenues for CNK. 2019-3.2B, 2020-0.7B, 2021E-1.5B, 2022E-3B 6.) MANY movies were made for the big screen. It destroys the EXPERIENCE sitting on your couch constantly distracted by your phone. Drink at home or go out to a lounge/bar? It's the EXPERIENCE and that will never change. 7.) Liquidity- limited cash burn and secured a runway into 2022 if the current operating environment continues. Negotiated payment deferrals and modifications and across a wide range of lease related auto contractual obligations. $124 million CARES ACT received during 2020 and April 2021 with an incremental 30 million expected by your end. 8.) Because of FUD and media hysteria over the variant, there is a significant discount to fair value from June. Patience required. Downside maybe to 14. Upside to 20-30+ Edit 8/9 huge news- 9.) AMC Entertainment has reached an agreement with Warner Bros. to showcase all of the studio\u2019s 2022 slate in theaters for 45 days. The world\u2019s largest theater chain had balked at Warner Bros.\u2032 decision to release this year\u2019s films in cinemas and through its HBO Max streaming service on the same day. AMC struck a similar contract with Comcast-owned Universal last year, which guaranteed theatrical exclusivity for at least 17 days before films could go to streaming or on-demand.

{"text": "Edit: the eviction moratorium is extended 60 days. 2 more months of people shitting In their landlords toilet without running water. Background: The eviction moratorium began as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) signed into law in March 2020 as a 120-day eviction moratorium for rental properties that are part of federal assistance programs or are subject to federally backed loans. Some, but not all, states adopted their own temporary eviction moratorium as well. The CARES Act eviction moratorium expired in July 2020. The CDC then imposed its own eviction moratorium halting residential evictions. Congress temporarily extended the CDC order once, and then the CDC extended it several more times to 30 June 2021. Source 1: [ \u200b So, you are probably thinking that what happens next is an enlightening conversation on government intervention and clear overstepping of authority by the centers for disease and control. You, like everyone else, is wondering if the power is going to go out while your tendies are still cooking in the microwave by the great depression 2. Do you sense a disturbance in the force? Millions of voices crying out as the door hits their ass on the way out? Well my fellow retard, you just clicked on a Slut\\_Spoiler shitpost discussion, and it's too late now. The synthesizer is riffing and you have to wait at least until Rick Astley starts singing. \u200b I have been searching for a while online how I can live that \"not much but honest life\" of a dairy farmer that milks the government. I was raised to be a contributing member of society and still trying to break the habit. You probably noticed I bolded text in the first paragraph. It's important to note that this moratorium only affects those with less than 99k in gross income or twice that for a family. Further, to be eligble for that, you have to show you have been actively seeking employment. Wow, 99k gross income! That's a lotta fucking people! and everyone with a friend named Reggie can verify, committing fraud by showing that you are actively looking for employment is easy to do. Almost as easy as making an ineligible resume on a napkin. This is the classic unemployment benefits hustle. One time I got a resume from a guy. It was an e-mail. Said \"I am electrician\". That was it. That was this guys Resume, Cover Letter, and Curriculum Vitae, but his Modus Operandi was being able to show the unemployment office that he had contacted us and put his best foot forward to get a job. Well, that's another month of making more money than you would get working (California). According to the GOV, he has made an effort to get employment. \u200b Now, there are a few more bylaws in there to protect you. The wording is very lose. \"If you may become homeless or be forced to live in a more crowded space\" you are eligible for the federal program. Not sure how they plan on enforcing that, but it's beside the point. As long as you aren't being violent or destructive you can't be kicked out. \u200b This word \"may\" is a problem for me. As in: \"You may have an enormous back rent bill when the moratorium terminates. If so, you may want to consider using the federal aid to help\". Even after not paying rent for months and getting unemployment, the federal government still has programs to help those in need. There isn't going to be a crisis. there isn't going to be global crash in the housing market. There is going to be a bunch of people on vacation getting called back to reality. \u200b So let's throw out some scenarios. Scenario Alpha: What we have is tennant A who hasn't paid his rent for a year and 4 months, and we have tennant B across the street who has done the same thing. How much money have they saved? to just put a rent number out there (I'll use $1,000) and multiplying it by 16 months is going to give you an impressive cushion: $16,000. These guys making 99k and under, with $16,000 savings aren't worried about being kicked out, because they are just going to move across the street. Tennant A and Tennant B will do an apartment swap, the landlords gets fucked over and the crisis is averted. The landlords of these tennants just want someone to come in who will pay, and guess who's been building up a nice nest egg? Obviously, these tennants have to leave. The bridge is burned. Would you let some guy who's been pennyfarthing about with your money stay? At a certain point, this shit gets personal. \u200b Scenario Omega: Landlord finally is able to remove his tennant. He jumps for joy that he can start collecting rent again from an actively employed tennant. The last guy leaves, looks for a house, and puts down a down payment. Thanks to his savings. \u200b Another thing to think about is that this is giving people OPPURTUNITY. They are out of work, everywhere is hiring. Always wanted to live in New York? the Governor is begging for people to come and get mugged. Want to go to anywhere in the US and start your life over? It's totally possible when there aren't any strings attached to you like job and rent, and you can afford the cost of starting over. Finally, I think that the real DD will be in the comments, which is a common theme with you animals. As for me, I've paid rent this whole time LIKE AN IDIOT. However, being honest is kind of the only thing that helps me sleep at night. That and not jeopardizing the roof over my head. \u200b tl;dr invest in $UHAL.

Options terms: Call: Associate this with margin call, aka when your account goes into debt. When you buy a call, you're agreeing to pay the price of the contract x 100 every day until expiry, unless the company goes bankrupt. Put: Associate this with putting money in your account. It's the opposite of a call. When you buy a put, you're agreeing for the price of the contract x 100 to be deposited into your account every day until expiry unless the company goes bankrupt. Theta: A multiplier on how much money you will get by buying a contract. Contracts with really high theta are sought after as they multiply your money much more than a contact with low theta. Delta: How likely you will be to get a margin call. Contracts with high delta are bad because you have a very high risk of getting a margin call.

Ok their revenue was up from $9.89 million to $18.4 million and they will get an additional $11 million in Q3 from Inner spirit, whatever assets Inner spirit owns will be added to this pile and their lending revenues from their latest two deals. $25,000,000 @ 5% APR and $103,000,000 @ 11.9% APR combined this is another $4.5 million per quarter in revenue. So Q3 revenue so far is at $33.9 million or estimated annual Revenue $135.6 million (to be reported Q3 2022, based on what\u2019s already in the books and assuming no growth). $135.6 \\ 10 = fair market value of that revenue of about $1.3 billion (CAD) converted to USD = $1.083B or another $0.53 per share $0.53 + $0.52 = $1.05 USD per share in hard assets and without growth that they are currently earning in today\u2019s markets and it doesn\u2019t include INSHFs assets or deploying the remaining $450M committed to lending (at 5% is another 22,500,000 in Revenue or at 11.9% is $53,550,000) multiply this times 10 and fair market rate for that revenue = $226M to $535.5M or another 11.1 to 26.4 cents per share. $1.05+ $0.1875 (midpoint of 11.1 and 26.4) = $1.2375 per share estimated value before adding any assets INSHF may have.

Kids these days want to look and feel like these influencers and are shunning the sugary high cal drinks and going after 0 cal, 0 sugar replacements or \"fat burning\" energy drinks. La Croix is leading the way in this sparkling zero calorie water category - it is pretty much agua. They hardly advertise, and the likes of Coke and Pepsi can't even fucking catch up; it's remarkable. If you do drink La Croix, you'll have noticed that they are now putting out new flavors all the time - addressing my main beef with them in the last couple years of having a generally weak and limited flavor rotation. Also, (potential catalyst alert) if and when FIZZ makes the leap into alcoholic beverages and produces a La Croix seltzer??? Prepare for liftoff. # Financials FIZZ has strong financials, excellent margins, an optimistic growth outlook, and very low levels of debt to boot. Here are some key stats: Forward P/E: 23 (compare to Monster Energy @ 35 and Coke @ 25) PEG (higher means more overvalued): 2.85 (MNST @ 3.66 KO @ 2.85) ROE - return on equity (I like this one because it shows how effective management is generating profits based on total shareholder equity): 43% (MNST @ 31% and KO @ 37%) - worth noting all of these are fantastic given that the S&P averages somewhere around 15% Generally speaking, FIZZ is undervalued relative to some of the other major players in the beverage market. The most surprising part is the level of short interest based on these fundamentals alone. And no, i'm not saying this is a short squeeze opportunity, however that doesn't mean that is not a potential catalyst. # Acquisition? (Potential catalyst alert) I don't know if there is a ton of precedent as to what happens when someone (an 85 year old at that) owns the vast majority of a publicly traded company. All I am saying is that the big players have been chasing this sparkling water juggernaut for years. Coke seems to have chosen their horse with Topo Chico, but would not be surprised to see another player enter the ring in a bid to take over this company with huge upside potential. This one just screams acquisition or LBO to me. Buyouts = premium. # Technical Analysis I do think there is some value in looking at the charts from a purely technical standpoint. Given that most trading is done by algorithms now, we have seen a deep downwards channel that has been in place since the January FIZZ squeeze. This is despite the fact that FIZZ continues to beat earnings and operate with healthy metrics and growth prospects. So, this strikes me as an either/or scenario (without any other catalyst) - they will continue to track this downwards channel through the $43 relative bottom (abandon ship if this occurs), or they will reverse the trend and break back up to 50. MACD looks good for the first time in a couple months. FIZZ is in desperate need of some news that attracts attention and volume. Here is a chart with lines - bitches love lines: \u200b ( # RISKS Mainly competitive, supply chain, and the fact that the dude owns the whole damn company.

{"text": "RKTs beginning to show signs of life again. First, What the ER has shown, Then my Hopium for the week ahead. With the latest ER showing healthy, strong growth, especially in the new markets they have entered. Its revealing that RKT will continue to grow and be profitable with any new market they enter. One of the many FUD campaigns against RKT was that they wouldn't be able to maintain profitability, growth, and Market share attacking, because of the low margin price wars with UWMC. That seems to have proven an annoyance but that RKT would continue to build and make shitpots of money nonetheless. RKT is continuing to show the negative Nancys of the world that it can and will run cheap to gobble up market share if they need to. Run Cheap, Steal Customers, Step 3 Profit. I've said before that when RKT receives the valuation it deserves and when the FUD is proved wrong it will be too late to join the fun. I believe this Earnings showed the BS these hedgies and banks have been spouting is wrong. 1 Billion in profit this quarter, 83.8 Billion in Closed Loan Origination Volume. That is up more than 11 Billion from Q2 2020. With 162% growth in 2 yrs. Q2 2019 - Q2 2021 RKT Homes is GROWING. Its becoming a power house in RKTs Arsenal with 2 Billion in revenue, and 1.8 million unique monthly viewers. around 70% of transactions on this site involve a Rocket Homes agent or Rocket mortgages. One business feeding the other. \u200b RKT AUTO made roughly 480 million and its not even fully released yet. I cant wait to see the kind of numbers this beast puts up in a couple quarters. Alrighty now that all the Q2 numbers, Revenues, and boring craps out the way, on to the HOPIUM, Options Data, and important events. I believe RKT will continue its upward momentum into the 20s this week at a minimum. Solid ER, Multiple raises in PT from different ANALysts, FUD arguments are showing less influential. Here is the current Option Data for 8/20 according to MarketChameleon \u200b Decent volume between the 18.50-19.50 range(ITM or Slightly OTM) at 22,737 with large volume on the 20-21c with 27,543. The largest strike volume being the 20c with 19,251. IV crush on the ER was not fun is definitely better than the stock was trading at pre ER. Things that I'm excited to see play out this week. Share Repurchase Program, Its real, its active and its been used once already(minimally but still used). The Buyback has been a weapon flexed by RKT for a whole quarter now, but one that many Share holders has assumed was just BS. With the 10Q filed on friday evening, We can see that RKT Has 1 billion already approved for their SRP, and has already Repurchased 496k Shares between 5/1/21 and 5/31/21 with at least 991.7 million still available. This was around the time of RKT low of 16.55. This tells me 2 things. RKT will step in to FukShorty, and that RKT has a price point they will step in at. This is no longer a ride to the ground stock for the shorts because the company can and will step in at any time. CFO Julie Both said during the ER CC, That She believes the stock is Massively undervalued and that they have 4 billion capital on hand for Buybacks and Special Dividends to force the stock in the correct direction. This was repeated a couple times. I believe there will be an announcement this week about those weapons at their disposal. And the final news to keep an eye out on is the UWMC Earnings Report. This reporting should be a win win for RKT. I for one want UWMC to have a great earnings. If they show good earnings RKT will continue upward based on the industry. And in the event of bad earnings it will only prove whose winning the Mortgage war. That's all I got for now, It aint much but its honest.... Anyways, Yall do what you want.

{"text": "^(I'm not a financial advisor, nor am I giving any financial advise. This is an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard posting on WSB with a bias due to having a very large position of my portfolio in $F. So, Don't act on anything posted in here and proceed on your own risk...) 1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed: For the last 44 consecutive years, the F-150 has been Americas best selling Truck. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was second only to the Apple iPhone, which raked in $55 billion, in terms of total revenue generated. The F-Series generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined, Just something to think about. On May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min ad video). It has all the features crucial for it's target buyers (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's a Truck which actually looks like a Truck. \u201cFord knows what pickup owners want,\u201d IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years. The reservation now have exceeded 120,000 since it's debut. An important point the CEO mentioned on the call was that about 75%, or 90,000, are new to Ford, according to the company! If anything, this indicates that Ford is the runner up for Tesla in the EV competition. almost every car manufacturer can make an EV, but only a few (I can count on one hand) can supply enough cars to keep up with demand with superb price and quality. Now Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla for the past 4 months with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of \"Potential(because they don't exist yet)\" competitors with superior car features. It's relevant to mention that Ford's EV sales (counting electric vehicles and hybrids) increased 177% during June, capping off 56,570 units sold so far in 2021. As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less... ^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.) 2- Ford Rivian Partnership: Ford-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now \ud83d\ude02(Ford is 55.64B at 14.18$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount with the most recent news being 902$million in Q1 of 2021. On Jul 23, it was announced that Rivian closed a $2.5 billion funding round, led by existing investors Ford, Amazon and T. Prior to it, they announced plans to open a second manufacturing plant and U.S States started submitting bids on it. Farley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares, \"but that's not why we invested,\" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend. Farley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car. He understands that the first move is the most important one in the EV Game, and with the Mach-E and F-150, Ford executed it's moves perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices, high quality, while maintaining the demand(something which Tesla still isn't able to). Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.3 \u200b 3- Bronco capturing Buyers of other brands: Prior to the release of the Bronco, it had 190,000 reservations. 66% of the reservations were converted to sales! Additionally, Farley mentioned in the earnings call that 70% of the 125,000 orders it has are customers of other brands. According to Ford, dealers are keeping Broncos on the lot for an average of 15 days!, with a big chunk of of the buyers coming from jeep. People are killing to get their hands on one. just go on Ebay and see for yourself. Bronco first Edition is going for 6 figures with the buy now being approx 150K$. I would understand PS5 scalpers, but that happening with Cars, I never would've imagined. This shows how the demand of this car is insane and why Ford raised it's 2021 Revenue expectation from $3.5 billion, to between $9-$10 billion and they'll probably raise it again in the next quarter. \u200b 4- Ford's Governmental Fleet 3D chess Strategy: \u201cFord clearly has business and government fleets in mind,\u201d Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said. Ford revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it\u2019s equipped with a standard battery that\u2019s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, which is the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings. Ford's vision to lead the EV market has a \u201cno-brainer\u201d component Elon Musk lacks: Targeting business and government fleet customers with new battery-powered trucks and vans. Ford\u2019s focus on converting Gas fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company\u2019s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts. They know that they are already the best with no competitors when it comes to the quality or price of the F-150. They will literally destroy their competitors with this approach. # 5- Valuation and Price target Yes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey. $Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple (Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- outdated) TSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X NIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN) GM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X F - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X (Important part starts here) As you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve. $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them. If you are new to WSB, $TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling. At that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83e\udd85. Ford is ready to dominate the EV market and it's just starting! (", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-08-11 21:09:16", "id": "p2ilxh"}

{"text": "Pfizer has a TON of upside potential. Here are a few different reasons why it could go to the moon. 1. As of time of posting, only 50% of the US population is fully vaccinated (2 shots) against COVID and only 36.1% of the world population is fully vaccinated. (Source: [ Once Pfizer stops selling vaccine to the US, is it going to stop production? No, it will start selling to the rest of the world. Moderna just jumped 17% earlier this week when it was announced that they will start selling to Australia. We could see a 10-20% pop each times the news announce that Pfizer is selling to another country! 2. There are still debaters out there so I'm not going to argue whether the vaccine works. The bigger point is that the government is paying for the vaccines and they believe the vaccine works. Therefore, US demand will literally be capped tits high until more of the US population is fully vaccination. Even once US demand dries up, the rest of the world will still be waiting for our extra supply for a long time. 3. There are new variants. With the delta variant, Pfizer has already publicly said that a third booster will help. Imagine if the US gov announces they will start paying for 3rd vaccinations? What if an Epsilon or Zeta variant starts blowing up? Would they pay for a 4th or 5th vaccination? 4. Gain comparison. Moderna has gained 253% since January 1st, 2021, even after the latest price correction. By contrast, Pfizer has only gained 31%. 5. Solid Financials. During the last 2 earnings releases (where the effects of COVID vaccines have shown an impact), Pfizer outperformed EPS by \\~+20% and +10%. Due to the current trend with COVID, I expect this to go on at least for another year. 6. This can be used as a hedge. If a new variant comes out and the S&P reacts adversely to it, at least Pfizer should be able to maintain value/go up because Pfizer/moderna/biontech would be most situated to come up with a response. Edit: The main concern seems to be that Pfizer is too big a company for COVID vaccination revenue to move the stock price. In Q2'21, Pfizer reported $19B of revenue, of which $7.8B came from COVID shots. By contrast, Moderna reported $4.4B of revenue. I would agree if COVID shots were only <10% of total revenue, but at \\~40% it's a different story. (source: [ and [ Edit 2: I've recently seen some concerning data that some of the comments brought up about the Pfizer vaccine having 40% efficacy vs the delta variant. This is based off a Mayo clinic study. There is also a separate New England Journal of Medicine study that showed Pfizer was 88% effective vs the delta variant. Both sources linked below. The Mayo clinic study itself is pretty technical and hard to read, but I think the tables in the back are easier to understand for laymen like myself. In page 20, there is a table that shows the overall efficacy rates. On or after 14 days following the second dose, 7 out of 4,198,947 had COVID-19 associated ICU admissions. 0 out of 4,199,985 had COVID-19 associated deaths. To me, this shows that the Pfizer vaccine indeed does do a ton to prevent serious illness and death. It may not be as effective at preventing someone from actually getting delta variant, but it would sure increase your chances of survival drastically if you did get it. A 4 million people sample size is definitely large enough to be statistically significant. I hate that a lot of times, news channels pick and choose statistics without showing the whole story in order to sell views. Mayo Clinic itself even states \u201cMayo Clinic is aware of media reports on the scientific preprint paper comparing vaccines\u2019 clinical effectiveness against the delta variant and breakthrough infections,\" a statement from Mayo Clinic says. \"We caution against drawing conclusions about vaccine effectiveness from a preprint study, which is intended only to be helpful to the scientific community and has not yet undergone the rigor of peer review.\u201d To me, the jury is still out on the efficacy of Pfizer vs the delta variant, but it sure as hell seems to prevent death and/or serious illness.

{"text": "IMHO, the investors are very cautious and uncertain currently judging from the mixed futures prices among the global market such as US (DJIA, SP500), Hong Kong (Hang Seng) and China. US futures normally have a positive correlation until recently where there are significant divergence from one another. The SPY recent price action also shows that its daily range are narrowing, a sign of market trading sideways, awaiting the next catalysts or bad news. Moreover, recently digested market data also indicates that analysts have overestimated the economic recovery from COVID with notables examples like Amazon and US NFP (Non-Farm Payroll) considerable negative variance. Central banks around the world are winding back their quantitative easing program and hinted at hiking up the interest rates. Current market headwinds are the lockdown (huge contributor to global demand), Delta COVID strain, central banks policy, trade war rhetoric and etc. Furthermore, bond yields (i.e. 5 and 10 years US treasury bonds) are decreasing which indicates that investors are moving their money in \u2018risk-free\u2019 government bonds because rising bond prices will reduce its yield (fixed coupon bond). US Dollar Index (DXY) has also risen tremendously recently and this signal a shift to lower risks assets such as bonds (USD priced government bonds) and away from share. Historically speaking, falling bond yields and a strengthening DXY normally indicates a correction might be incoming. SP500 has slowed recently and this trend could be attributed towards investors downgrading their valuation based on the recently announced earnings. In relation to SPY, the price has been trading on the upper end of the Bollinger Bands but didn\u2019t show any signs of breaking out. The linear regression shows that the price is moving around its historical average (red line) and didn\u2019t show any signs of breaking out too. Those indicators supports the hypothesis that the market is unsure and waiting for a catalysts. US is currently in earnings seasons and multiple companies earnings has been published and some of them are a disappointment (lower than estimates). US mining stocks underperform Global Sector Basic Material (MXI) average while its other sector like utilities and healthcare outperformed the Global sector after digesting the overall poor earnings results. Looking at the monthly growth of those ETF above, investors are currently taking a defensive and low risk approach by investing in utilities, healthcare and real estate. In an aggressive bull markets, technology and financial sector will do very well which is on the contrary to the above data.

Over Q1, Coinbase reported a 3.05 EPS, with a user growth from 2M to 6.1M transacting users, and in total 56M users. In total, they generated 1.8B revenue. They reached these impressive numbers thanks to the start of the bull market. See below the number of transactions on the Bit-coin, over the last year. \u200b Q2 report will be between April and June, which means during still-extremely strong volatility market. In my opinion, it should results to even stronger EPS, when they will announce their results. The crazy part is that consensus amongst analyst is 2.23 EPS for Q2 2021. It's 27% lower. Crazy right? So yes, June to August looks weaker. The volatility levels seems to have been affected, as the Bit-coin plumetted from $60K to $40 - 45K today. However, Coinbase are not the kind of guys that will deliver a poor outlook on their future performances. On their last Q1 report, they said: \" \u201cAs we have previously discussed, it is important for investors to remember that our business is inherently unpredictable.\u201d \u200b TLDR: Analysts are totally wrong about projected Q2 EPS by over 30-40% for Coinbase.

{"text": "Ray Dalio # Principles of Navigating Big Debt Crises - Policy makers have 4 levers to pull when dealing with debt - Austerity - Debt defaults/Restructurings - Central Bank printing money \"QE\" - Transfers of money and credit - The first 2 are deflationary and the latter 2 are inflationary. Which levers the policy makers pull determine who benefits and who suffers. This process is painful for everyone - Template of a debt crisis - Typically occur because debt and debt service costs rise faster than the incomes needed to service that debt - Usually, a central bank can alleviate typical debt crises by lowering interest rates, but severe crises occur when that is no longer possible. IE - 0% interest rates - Classically, a lot of short-term debt cycles leads to a long-term debt cycle. - Long term debt cycles are just bigger versions of short-term debt cycles - During the upswing, credit is freely available and people are willing to take on more risk - Credit is cut during a crisis. Asset prices fall, debtors have trouble servicing debt, investors get scared and cautious which leads to liquidity problems - Deflationary Depressions \u2013 typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by the local currency - Inflationary Depressions \u2013 typically occur in countries where most of the debt is financed by foreign currency - Positive effects of debt cycles come first; negative come later - Typically, the worst debt bubbles are not accompanied by high and rising inflation, but by asset price inflation financed by debt growth - This is because policymakers make the mistake of accommodating debt growth because they are focused on inflation and/or growth, not on debt growth itself, the asset inflations they are producing, and whether or not debts will be able to be serviced - It is the tightening of monetary policy that usually pops a bubble - No specific event or shock caused the stock market bubble to burst in 1929 - During a severe economic downturn, protectionist/populist policies begin to rise and outrage over the governments role in \"bailing out\" financial institutions - Once policymakers shift their attention to increasing financial regulation and oversight, that typically signals the of the big debt cycle - It is typically the case that the first tightening or policy does not hurt stocks and the economy - By 1937, all currencies had all devalued a lot against Gold, but not so much against each other - Gold bullion is the only asset that has no counterparty risk # Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle - Early \u2013 Debt is not growing faster than incomes. Debt is financing activities that produce growth. Known as \"Goldilocks\" period - Bubble \u2013 Debt is rising faster than incomes and this produces strong asset returns and growth. This process is generally self-reinforcing because it allows people to borrow more. This can go on for decades. These are short term cycles but lots of them adding up can lead to a long-term debt cycle - Usually start from Bull markets. Lower interest rates drive asset prices higher, which leads to economic growth and the ability to take on more debt - Lending standards are reduced as people and business lever up - Lenders and speculators make lots of fast/easy money which reinforces the bubble - As a bubble nears the top of the cycle, the economy is the most vulnerable, but people are feeling the wealthiest and the most bullish - The Boom encourages new speculators into the market further driving up prices - Humans by nature tend to move in crowds and weight recent experiences more heavily. This causes people to extrapolate too much from the recent past in both up and down markets - Central banks usually target inflation or inflation/growth and don't target the management of bubbles, the debt growth they enable can go on to finance the creation of bubbles. And the bursting of bubbles can cause severe economic pain - Don't only look at one metric to serve as an indicator of a debt crisis - Monetary policy, in many cases, helps inflate the bubble rather than constrain it - How to Spot a Bubble - Prices are high relative to traditional measures - Broad bullish sentiment - Purchases are financed by high leverage - New buyers enter the market - Buyers make very forward purchases to speculate or protect themselves from future price gains - Stimulative monetary policy reinflates the bubble and tight monetary policy contributes to its popping - The Top \u2013 prices have been driven by a lot of leveraged buying and the market gets fully long, leveraged, and overpriced, it becomes rip for reversal - Most often occurs when the central bank starts to tighten and interest rates rise for whatever reason - This causes a debt service squeeze and hurts asset prices. Which reduces the amount of money lenders are willing to lend out as they become cautious - Investors move from risk assets to less risky assets slowing down growth - A negative \"wealth effect\" occurs when one's wealth declines, which leads to less lending and spending. This is due to both negative psychology and financial condition - Yield curve is usually flat or inverted - People are incentivized to move into cash just before the crash which itself slows down lending - Unemployment is low - The more leverage that exists and the higher the prices, the less tightening it takes to prick the bubble and the bigger the bust that follows - Immediate post bubble period - People mistakenly judge the decline to be a buying opportunity and find \"cheap\" stocks failing to see that earning are likely to decline much more. They extrapolate too much from the recent past - Wealth falls first and incomes fall later, creditworthiness worsens, which constricts lending activity, this hurt spending and lowers investments and makes borrowing more difficult - As asset prices fall, the lenders tighten lending standards which hurts spending and investment - This causes people to sell investments to raise cash which causes more driving down of prices and is a self-reinforcing cycle - The \"Depression\" - In a normal recession, cutting interest rates can stimulate the economy. But in a depression, rates can't be cut because they are already at 0% - The central banks have to go to alternative ways to stimulate the economy. IE \u2013 \"QE\" or printing money or stimulus - Declines of 50% of people's assets are common - As the depression begins, defaults and restructurings hit the various people. Especially leveraged ones (Banks) - Runs on banks are common - At this stage of the cycle, debt defaults and austerity dominate which are deflationary - People financial condition worsens, which makes lenders more reluctant to loan money. Which slows down the economy - Usually, institutions and policymakers have learned from the past, but not every depression is the same as before and this catches them off guard. It doesn't tend to play out like the last one that they are defending against - If the central bank prints money to alleviate the credit shortage, it can cause inflation if not careful - A big part of this deleveraging process is that people discover that much of what they thought they of as wealth was simply other people promises to give them money. And now those promises are not being kept and that wealth isn't real - Fear cascades through the system, and these fears feed on themselves and lead to a scramble for cash that results in a shortage (investors sell assets) - The depression phase is dominated by deflationary forces of debt reduction - The investor class experiences a tremendous loss of \"real\" wealth, and as a result, they become extremely defensive, they seek safety in liquid investments like bonds, gold or cash - The 4 options policymakers have for dealing with the depression - They are typically slow to react initially because they don't want to bail out the people who got themselves into problems - Austerity \u2013 Usually the most obvious thing to do. But it doesn't bring the debt and income into balance. Government revenues fall and demands for government services rise which cause deficits to rise and subsequent rise in taxes. All this is bad - \"QE\" or Printing Money \u2013 The moves come in progressively larger doses as more modest initial attempts to rectify the imbalances fail. However, those early efforts typically produce bear market rallies - Debt defaults/Restructurings \u2013 You have to clean out the bad debt so the flow of money can continue to return to prosperity. - Redistribute the Wealth \u2013 Wealth gaps increase during bubbles and they become glaring during the hard times. Political populism tends to take hold after this time period. Taxes on the rich become common talking points. Central bank purchases of assets disproportionally help the rich - Stocks usually fall 50% - Currency devaluation will usually be 50% against gold - Deficits widen to 6% of GDP - Economic activity falls about 10% - Unemployment is 10-15% - Aggressive stimulation usually occurs about 2-3 years into a depression - The \"Beautiful Deleveraging\" - Happens when the policymakers move the 4 levers in a balanced way - Printing money during this phase doesn't necessarily cause inflation. It won't if its offsets falling credit and the deflationary forces. If income is growing faster than debt, you will be ok. However, if debt is growing faster than income, you can have a problem. - But central bankers can abuse the stimulative policy's and cause a \"ugly inflationary deleveraging\" IE \u2013 Weimer Germany in the 1920's - Printing money and debt monetization/government guarantees are inevitable in depressions in which interest rate cuts won't work (IE \u2013 Already at 0%) - All the deleveraging eventually led to big waves of money creation, fiscal deficits, and currency devaluations (against gold, commodities, and stocks) - In the end, policy makers always print money because it is the easiest - Austerity causes more pain than benefit - Big restructuring wipes out too much wealth too fast - Redistributing of sufficient size doesn't happen without a revolution - Pushing on a string phase - Late in the cycle, the policy makers have to be careful because their stimulative policies effects have diminished. - Economy usually enters a low growth and low return of assets - The danger of this phase is that too much money printing and subsequent devaluation can cause a \"ugly inflationary deleveraging\" to occur - Monetary Policy 1 - Usually try to lower interest rates first. If that doesn't work, they go to 2 - Monetary Policy 2 - \"QE\" or printing money and buying financial assets. But over time, QE's ability to stimulate the market is reduced as asset prices are high and risk premiums are low. IE \u2013 investors don't want to buy expensive assets that are projected to have low returns. Investors move into cash for protection which makes further QE less and less effective - Sometimes at this phase, policy makers monetize debt in even larger quantities in an attempt to compensate for QE reduced effectiveness. This may provide a short-term boost but there is a real risk that prolonged monetization will lead people to question the currency's suitability as a store of value. This can cause investors to rush to safe havens like Gold - At some point, low interest rates and low premiums on risk assets from monetary policy 2 don't work anymore and policy makers look to Monetary Policy 3 to stimulate the economy - Monetary Policy 3 \u2013 Where the US is at in 2020 - Puts money directly into the hands of spenders instead of investors/savers and incentivizes them to spend it - Government provides direct or indirect stimulus payments in many different forms - Normalization - System gets back to normal. But this usually takes 5-10 years and economic activity is slow during this time frame. And it takes investors a very long time to get comfortable taking the risk of holding equities again # Inflationary Depression - Reserve currency countries that don't have significant foreign currency debt can have inflationary depressions, they usually emerge more slowly and later in the process, after sustained and repeated overuse of stimulus to reverse a deflationary deleveraging. - If a reserve-currency country permits much higher inflation in order to keep growth stronger by printing lots of money, it can further undermine demand for the currency, erode its reserve currency status (IE make investors view it less as a store of wealth) and turn its deleveraging into an inflationary one", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-08-14 04:36:05", "id": "p3yu4r"}

{"text": "Alright Retards, I am on a bit of a biotech spree the past few months because... well let's be honest, who doesn't like volatility? If you're looking for a stock with potential to 2-3x in the next few month's than look no further. The company I am talking about today is Sage therapeutics (SAGE). So what is SAGE? Well it's a biopharmaceutical company committed to developing novel therapies with the potential to transform the lives of people with debilitating disorders of the brain. Analytics - For starters the Average Price Target according to Yahoo Finance is around 92$ a share and it is currently at 42.57$ a share at the time of this writing. Not to mention, even after some confusing Phase 3 results which I will get into later, a few analysts cut price targets from anywhere to 63$-75$ which is still significantly above the share price as of right now. What I find most staggering is SAGE trades at a P/E ratio of roughly 3.64 which is an absolute anomaly. They have $2 billion dollars in cash and next to no debt. This 2 billion dollars was mostly from biogen's recent investment in SAGE. They invested $850 million dollars cash plus an initial $650 million equity stake in the company. They are literally trading at 0 cash/book ratio, off this alone SAGE is completely undervalued because its market cap is about $2.45 billion dollars. YES I KNOW and undervalued stock in todays market? Who would of thought it to be in biotech. SAGE's EPS is also 11.84, and this is from their current drug that is on the market (Zulresso) Chart Analysis - Now SAGE has been in a LONG downtrend. It went from 96$ at it's peak in January to $40.81 about a week ago. But it has FINALLY shown signs of turning around. Insiders just recently purchase shares at $56 and $45 respectively. The CEO himself has bought about $2 million dollars worth of shares, this always a bullish sign. It could be part of an insider regular scheduling or some quarterly filing, but nonetheless it's never a bad sign. Anyways, the RSI is oversold on the 1 year and 5 year. The MACD on the 1 year is finally curling up and on the 6 month it's actually broke through which is a great sign. Some volume has been coming in because of the news of insider buying, and there is a MASSIVE gap that needs to be filled from the $66 - $75 dollar range. We will look at their main drug in their upcoming pipeline as with any biotech stock, it is the most important thing to look at. We've seen with MRNA how a strong pipeline can attract large institutional buys. SAGE has already partnered with Biogen to produce their \"bread and butter\" drug so to speak Zuranolone. Zuranolone is in phase 3 trials. Just a quick side note.... out of 100 drugs that make it to phase 2, about 12 of them make it to phase 3 and then out of those, 6 of them make it to FDA approval. Not to mention SAGE already has a drug out which produces real revenue. About Zuranolone- Zuranolone is an investigational medication which is under development by SAGE Therapeutics for the treatment of depressive disorders and a variety of other indications. It is a synthetic, orally active, inhibitory pregnane neurosteroid, and acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor. As I said earlier it is currently in phase 3. Here are some key highlights of the trial: - At the Day 15 primary endpoint, zuranolone 50 mg showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in depressive symptoms as measured by HAMD-17 (p=0.0141) compared to placebo -Rapid onset of treatment effect was seen in HAMD-17 results at Days 3, 8, and 12 -Patients with a response at Day 15 to zuranolone retained on average 86% of their HAMD-17 improvement at Day 42 (4 weeks after dosing ended) -Zuranolone was generally well-tolerated and demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previous clinical studies; trial completion rate was 90.3% in the zuranolone group The results were solid and we will monitor the data moving forward but I am confident this will be approved by the FDA. Link to the results here: A link and screenshot to all of there pipeline. I won't mention any of them besides Zuranolone above because it is currently the most important. But you can all take a look for yourself. I believe this is worth at least 70$ and can be achieved extremely quickly Anyway there will be a more in depth part 2 coming soon but this should get SAGE on the radar for some of you lads. As always this is not Financial Advice, invest your own money at your own will and all I'm trying to do is educate a few of you retards Position : 1300 shares at 45$, as for options I would take a look at the 50c's, liquidity may be shit though \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-08-12 02:29:38", "id": "p2owd2"}
{"text": "TLDR; Options Data supports a trading range of $50-70. HOOD 70c 9/24. RH might be a POS but this is about money. My plan to post these consistently fell apart a bit. Anyways the last call for SPY 439c 7/23 betting on $440 was on the dime (Actually within a dime) and ended up being fairly profitable after some averaging down. The put credit spreads not so much but that's life. However this trading method (Modeling out Delta Hedging) works significantly better on heavily options driven equities which brings me to the recent IPO of Robinhood (HOOD). First off, forget what you think about the company or Vlad Tenev. This is about making money and I don't give a fuck about the emotional component. Second, I've explained the options/underlying mechanic and some explanation of what I'm doing in past posts. We're looking at delta hedging to predict what prices are more likely. Go read it there if you're still confused. Options rolled out last week and have been very influential on the movement of HOOD. This is the model of the options chain (weighted for Delta \u0394) on 4 AUG close. HOOD \u0394Weighted Model for 4 AUG 21. ( Because of the even Put/Call ratio, the net \u0394 is slightly negative and nonsignificant. Therein lies a problem. To say $75 is \u0394 neutral assumes all those options are being held/hedged by one entity which would therefore have neutral directional risk and no need to hedge much at all. This isn't entirely realistic since different market makers are writing these contracts and each hold different directional positions. But the hedging effect would balance out on an aggregate level because hedging calls and puts balance out. My brain is too smooth to have a hard answer either way so I'm not confident enough to bet anything on it. Positions: HOOD 70c 9/24 My one concern is the insane implied volatility. As of Friday close, IV was sitting at 235% which is insane and options premiums certainly reflect that. You can be completely correct about direction and price and still lose when Vega bends you over. But I didn't get here being risk averse so fuck it.

{"text": "It's exciting to see WSB starting to get pumped about commercial EV plays like Microvast and Proterra. I'm super interested in this space and I'd like to share my DD on the company I believe has the highest potential upside. Table of Contents: I. Introduction II. Connections III. Advantage IV. Projections V. Catalysts VI. Current Price VII. The Product VIII. Popular Opinions IX. My Position X. Conclusion \u200b I. Introduction: Lion Electric is a manufacturer of yellow school buses, public transit buses, semi-trucks, bucket trucks, and garbage/refuse trucks. Incorporated in 2008, Lion has over 390 vehicles on the road today, the stock is going to go through the roof. 2. Biden infrastructure: With billions of dollars being poured into EV, the start of the commercial EV revolution is officially beginning. Knowing that they must start converting their fleets to electric, businesses, school districts, and local government will start ordering the highest quality vehicles in the market, Lion Electric vehicles. 3. Earnings: Lion will hold earnings on August 13 announces plans to form a Lion fleet, a huge tailwind will ensue. Unfortunately I'm not an insider so I don't know who this will be, but Biden is basically guaranteeing this will occur. 6. New plant: This one is based on speculation and rumor, but supposedly Lion is shopping around for a location for a second US manufacturing plant. This would be huge news and would only serve to validate their presence as the new leader in the space. 7. Short squeeze: The hedges went in big shorting every SPAC, regardless of their fundamentals of company strength. And they made a lot of money. Short interest for Lion is huge, and the moment of the above catalysts hits, these shorts will need to cover. You know the rest. VI. Current Price Lion Electric has a market cap of 2.737B. Nikola motors has a market cap of 4.094B. Let that sink for a moment. Lion is everything Nikola wishes it was without any of the fraud or scams, yet trades at a fraction of its valuation. Why? The Spac Attack During the Spac craze of last year, a large number of companies went public. Many of these spacs brought healthy companies public, like Lion Electric, Proterra, and Lightning eMotors. But unfortunately, a number of them like Nikola Everything is in place for Lion to become the leader of the commercial EV space, and we get to buy it for pennies on the dollar. Lion has actually held up pretty well despite the Spac Attack, managing to maintain its key supports. This is because their investors know Lion has the superior product, management, and growth prospectives. The other EV ex-spacs have suffered from issues like failing vehicles (Like Proterra VII. The Product Lion is known in the industry for its high quality products and customer support, and as corporations and school districts decide who to build their fleet with this will become increasingly important. Lion offers 7 electric truck and bus models available for purchase today.: Lion fleets act as ( that build up energy during off-hours and feed them back into the system during peak-hours to generate a daily profit. This cost-saving system is a big selling point for school districts and Lion's proprietary tech in this field is making it stand out from its competition. Lion's ( for medium and heavy-duty urban electric vehicles is 110B in North America. Keep in mind, Lion's entire current market cap is less than 3B. With its currently facility in Quebec rated for 2500 vehicles a year, and its new Joliet facility rated at 20,000 vehicles a year, Lion is going to take a massive chunk of this TAM. Since EV companies generally trade a much higher multiple of their yearly revenue, you can begin to grasp how massive this trade is. ( VIII. Popular Opinions If you take a look at the analysts, ( and one as a Hold. Their average price target is $22.48, with a high estimate of $26. To be honest, I don't really care much for analysts or their price targets. Lion should be trading a multiple higher than these targets, which goes to show you how much of a deal it really is at $14. I care more about popular investors and their influence on market perception. The Dumb Money crew, lead by investor Chris Camillo has turned $20,000 into well over $20 million using their unique investing style called 'Social Arbitrage'. They hold a $1 million dollar investment in Lion Electric and ( The video is from when Lion was still a spac, but the thesis holds and they still have their position. Check the video out! Jim Cramer is a Lion Electric bull, having talked about it multiple times on his show. He even had the CEO Marc B\u00e9dard ( to discuss Lion's Amazon partnership. While I don't consider myself a MadMoney fan, once Lion starts meeting its projections Cramer is going to be pumping this to all older investors. MeetKevin, a popular investing YouTuber, is bullish on EV companies and mentions Lion Electric all the time. While he's much more focused on Tesla and Lucid, I'm expecting some good coverage from him when Lion ramps up. Also he actually has a realistic chance of becoming ( Alex Cutler, popular overall EV bull, talks about Lion quite often and has a position. Unfortunately he got absolutely wrecked during the Spac attack. I think once the rotation back into small cap EV occurs he'll be getting a lot more spotlight, and his appreciation of Lion is sure to help us moon once we start trending. While Lion Electric is still very under the radar, already having a number of big YouTubers on board is going to help Lion's market cap immensely when one or more of the above catalysts hit the news. I would still be as equally heavy in my trade if Lion had no support from popular influencers, but exposure from people like Chris Camillo is only going to help. IX. My Position This DD wouldn't be complete if I didn't put my money where my mouth is. In the spirit of WSB and to emphasis my conviction on this trade, I've put my entire portfolio into long-term OOTM call options. I own 600 $20 call options expiring 1/20/23, valued at $2.45 each for a total of $147,000. This is my entire life savings accumulated through work and investment profits. I would be holding these contracts to expiration and expect to make 2-3 million dollars off of them, perhaps more. Why did I buy leaps? Simply put, they provide me much more leverage than owning equity while still giving me a comfortable time buffer for the above catalysts to make this stock run. Since Lion was at $22 within the last month and has an ATH of $35, I consider the chance of them expiring out of the money extremely small. When Lion reached $22 last month my portfolio was worth almost $400k, but these diamond hands ain't selling. ( X. Conclusion In my opinion, Lion Electric is almost the perfect trade. With a huge tailwind of government incentives on the way, big name clients such as Amazon, and a massive new facility about to come online, I genuinely see this stock going to the moon. As the United States moves to meet its 50% 2030 EV mandate, corporations and local/state government will be racing to get ahead of the game. Lion will be ready to supply their entire fleets. As legacy auto-makers continue to fall farther and farther behind, a few key US names stand to rise above and take advantage of the coming EV government spending spree. Rivian and Workhorse on small commercial EV, Bluebird and Proterra on busses, and Tesla beginning to produce semis. But only one company has the catalogue, connections, and production to become the true King of the commercial EV jungle. Lion Electric. \u200b Disclaimer: I am not an investment advisor.

{"text": "Hey Everyone, it's u/nobjos back with this week's analysis! Preamble Hedge Funds are a controversial breed of companies. On one hand, you have Michael Burry\u2019s Scion Capital returning 489%, these above returns correlate directly with the returns of Fund of Funds (FOF), returned 233.1% (\\~390% less than avg Hedge Fund) vs SPY returning 846%! Warren Buffet\u2019s take of Hedge Funds In 2007, Warren Buffet had entered into a famous bet that an unmanaged, low-cost S&P 500 stock index fund would out-perform an actively managed group of high-cost hedge funds over the ten-year period from 2008 to 2017 when performance was measured net of fees, costs, and expenses. The result was similar to the above with S&P 500 beating all the actively managed funds by a significant margin. This is what he wrote to the investors in his annual letter >A number of smart people are involved in running hedge funds. But to a great extent their efforts are self-neutralizing, and their IQ will not overcome the costs they impose on investors. Investors, on average and over time, will do better with a low-cost index fund than with a group of funds of funds. Performance comes, performance goes. Fees never falter While I don\u2019t completely agree with this view that it\u2019s impossible for Hedge Funds to beat the market (The famous Medallion Fund of Renaissance Technologies compared to S&P 500\u2018s \\~8% annualized returns over the last 30 years). But, it seems that on average Hedge Funds do return lesser than the stock market benchmark! An alternative view It would be now easy to conclude now that Hedge funds are pointless and the people who invest them in at not savvy investors. But, in the range of -10 to -22%, hedge funds were still net positive. Even in the 2008 Financial crisis, the difference in losses between SPY and hedge funds was a staggering 15%. This chart also showcases the important fact that most hedge funds are actually hedged pretty well in reality \\. We only usually hear about outliers such as Michael Burry\u2019s insane bet or how Bill Hwang of Archegos Capital lost $20B in two days which biases our entire outlook about hedge funds. To put this in perspective, over the period from January 1994 to March 2021, volatility (annualized standard deviation) of the S&P 500 was about 14.9% while the volatility of the aggregated hedge funds was only about 6.79% \\. While you and I might care about the extra returns of SPY, I guess when you have 100\u2019s of Millions of dollars, it becomes more important to conserve your funds rather than to chase a few extra percentage points of returns in SPY. Conclusion I started off the analysis with the expectation that Hedge Funds would easily be beating the market so as to justify their exorbitant fee structure. As we can see from the analysis, on average they don\u2019t beat the market but provide sophisticated methods of diversification for big funds and HNI\u2019s. Even if you want some effective diversification, it would be much better to invest directly with established hedge funds rather than going for Fund of Funds as with the latter, most of your returns would be taken by the two-tiered fee structure. What this means for the average investor is that in almost all cases, you would get a better return on your investment over the long run by just investing in a low-cost index fund. Replicating what pension funds and HNI\u2019s do might not be the best strategy for your portfolio. Google sheet containing all the data used in this analysis: Here + $4K (20% of the profit) for a total of $6K. Even if they lose money, they will still charge you $2K for managing your money. Vanguard SP500 ETF would charge you $30 for the same! \\ Minimum initial investments for hedge funds usually range from $100,000 to $2 million and you can only withdraw funds when you\u2019ve invested a certain amount of money during specified times of the year. You also need to have a minimum net worth of $1 million and your annual income should amount to more than $200,000. \\ Barclayhedge provides data for the performance of individual hedge funds but it costs somewhere between $10-30K. I like you guys, but not that much :P! \\ The returns are average not weighted average based on the asset under management so it\u2019s representative of the individual returns of the Hedge funds and does not bias the analysis due to the size of the Hedge Fund. \\ Please note that the SPY returns are not net of fees. But this would be inconsequential as a low-cost Vanguard index fund has fees as low as 0.03%. The returns shown for hedge funds are net of fees. \\ To put the performance of Medallion Fund in perspective (its considered as the greatest money-making machine of all time), $1 invested in the Medallion Fund from 1988-2018 would have grown to over $20,000 (net of fees) while $1 invested in the S&P 500 would have only grown to $20 over the same time period. Even a $1 investment in Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway would have only grown to $100 during this time. \\ For e.g., some hedge funds by inexpensive long-dated put options that hedges against a sudden market downturn. While this would ultimately make their net return lower in a bull market, in case of a huge crash, they would still be positive.

Just the day before yesterday, Pfizer shares hit an all-time high of $48,57, even breaking its record high of 1999. Not only this, the stock price of BioNTech SE (NASDAQ: BNTX) on August 9 gained 14.97% from a previous close of $389.01 to $447.23. Perhaps, the charm of BioNTech started to wane in subsequent days with closing at losses of almost 7% and 14% intraday. Well\u2026these were a matter of two days, and it will be too premature to analyze the trend reversal. So far, since Mid-July, BioNTech shares have been rallying high. To give you some context, these two days of intraday loss made BioNTech and Moderna forego a combined $60 billion market value. And, what was the reason? Investors were hesitant to accept their lofty valuation! What\u2019s wrong with everyone?! Covid has still not gone\u2026! Companies have time to cash in some sales. BioNTech posted earnings of $12.67 per share for the second quarter. And, their sales were $6.2 billion, beating analyst expectations. Anyway\u2026.as per the news media, demand for the covid-19 vaccine will continue till 2022 and beyond. It simply signifies pharma companies\u2019 sales are facing no threat in near future. Investors should also see that, as of late July, BioNTech along with Pfizer has shipped around a billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, these pharma firms have also signed orders for delivering more than 2.2 billion doses this year. The estimates for these 2.2 m billion doses can be easily concluded at \u20ac15.9 billion. The catch is, these pharma firms will be manufacturing 4 billion doses by next year. Jeez! Why won\u2019t their stocks soar high! Things don't end here. In a presentation yesterday, BioNTech revealed that their vaccine is effective against all the current variants including the Delta variant.

Shorts and Hedgies have been playing around this stock for a long time and Every Retail Investor was irritated by that, Good results - price down, new deals - price down, positive announcements - price down, how long this could go on\u2026 even last night many were skeptical with the expected Good Earnings report by saying - PLTR GOOD EARNINGS = Price Down\u2026 such was the mentality of frustrated investors for so long\u2026 Finally, PLTR turned the tables, and the stock price started climbing up. Funny part is : just after the Good Earnings report - shorts were scared and started their bombardment of negative PLTR sentiments on Stockwits by trying to scare the bullish investors. Even when Palantir was at 24$ today - Bears tried to convince all to take the profit and run away \ud83d\ude02 but This time their trick didn\u2019t work\u2026 Couple of months back, $PLTR had touched 40$ line, but then got pulled back, but now with another great earning report and easily achievable guidance value - Palantir is going to Shine on top of all and if retail Investors realize it\u2019s worth and stay bullish behind it then it can easily cross 40$ again and may be even 50$+ Remember, $PLTR is not a meme stock (in a way it can be though, lol) - but a REAL COMPANY WITH AWESOME TRACK RCORD, Good Earnings, Incremental Focussed growth, great management team, Top of the Shelf software company which enables Private as well as Govt / Defense agencies, and it\u2019s a Pioneer in its domain. It\u2019s even considered as one of the top 12 AI companies in the world.

If a company is doing good then we want to invest there- and not to doom That company by shorting.

I was doing some research when I found something massive. There is not nearly enough Titanium Dioxide to meet global demand. Now I know from experience that Titanium Dioxide is Used in paint and Food coloring, both of which I consume daily. However it's also used in sunscreen and this is where I believe there is a huge option for price discovery. See Paint and Food coloring are manufactured in The U.S for the most part, meaning that supply chain shortages and a buildup of inventory over Covid don't make these products in short supply. However one thing we don't produce domestically on a large scale is sunscreen chemicals. These mostly come from India,China, Germany and the Netherlands. Why sunscreen manufacturers can make you Rich? 1. Global shortage in sunscreen chemicals such as... Phenyl benzimidazole sulphonic acid, titanium dioxide, and avobenzone. 2.

Cosmetic and global sunscreen market is growing 9. Skin cancer is on the rise. 10. This year has been hotter then most years around the world. 11. Recent consumer demand for sunscreen. 12. Speculators will hoard sunscreen which will raise prices artificially. The above events in perfect combination could cause for a sky-high evaluation in both the sunscreen futures market and sunscreen manufacturers. Hell of the two penny stocks that you could buy to profit off of sunscreen manufacturing. One is already up 1000 percent this year. I believe this number could easily be 10000 percent based on the above hypothesis. My plan: buy everything sunscreen related. Any equity I can own as well as physical sunscreen I will go all in on.

{"text": "It's me again, bringing you your next ticket to the moon next to Jeff Bezos. Today's pick is a beaten-down stock, and looks like it's poised for a massive recovery. In this market, where everything seems to go up, there still remain opportunities and this stock is a prime example of that, I'm talking about $SDC, Smile Direct Club. \u200b SDC essentially competes with Invisalign in braces. They make aligners to straighten your teeth, nothing too fancy. You can't use their products for the most complicated cases, but works great for milder cases. However, their pricing clearly undercuts traditional braces and reduce the cost of wearing traditional braces ($5'800 on average for braces to $1950) \u200b SDC dropped 25% just yesterday after earnings. They reported $174m or 62.7% growth year over year Net loss of $(55)m or an improvement of 41.6% year over year Adjusted EBITDA of $(22)m, a decrease of $2m year over year Diluted EPS of $(0.14), a 44% improvement year over year These numbers are great especially considering the extremely cheap valuation and all the headwinds the company faced last year. Most of the issues they faced are one-off expenses and the company is slowly going to get to profitability. Keep in mind that this isn't your typical Pump and Dump ultra high growth stock, this is a value play. \u200b On their earnings call they said that they were negatively impacted by a cyber attack in April, the lasting economic effects of COVID-19, and the slower scaling of international markets due to COVID. However, they are planning to relaunch in Germany and Spain this year and will resume focus on acquiring new customers. This is essentially a new chapter for their business, as they are going to be more aggressive on their customer acquisition and expansion into new markets. \u200b It's important to note that the long-term story for SDC is intact and looks very promising, as they turn their business around to avoid these short-term one-off issues. SDC has a vertically-integrated platform and a very unique way of operating that prevents any other competitors from stealing their business. This is crucial to their business and is what will eventually allow them to grow profitably. \u200b Short-sellers seem to have forgotten the long-term growth story of SDC and have just thrown away the stock, and this down move is unjustified, as the future is very bright for SDC. Analysts have all come out and downgraded the stock which pushed prices down even more. The company is expected to grow about 20% this year and 24% in 2022. For a value play, have you ever seen numbers like that, this is not your average boomer stock. I can clearly see a path where this company becomes profitable this year, as they really seem to have shifted focus on growing profitability. \u200b They could clearly receive a buy-out from Align technologies or another healthcare company. At this valuation, I think major health care companies, manufacturing companies are seriously doing due diligence on SDC. I would clearly see P&G or another conglomerate getting interested in SDC at these prices. \u200b Positions: 60x 5$ Calls 10000 Shares \u200b TLDR: $SDC just got slammed on earnings yesterday and dropped 25% to $5. $SDC is a great value play at this cheap valuation. As they shift their focus towards profitability, the recovery to $10. Hop aboard with dirt-cheap calls.

If the market is unable to hold above these levels the next bearish breakouts turn into much stronger drops. The 161 level is an inflection point, not a certain death zone. So if the SPX can hold above here I do think it then will probably continue to have nice upward trending properties. And I suppose that could happen.

Maybe the aliens shutting off the internet or something. IDK. But watch out for news and a sharp break of the 161 (4,140 price level).

{"text": "AMD has had an incredible run these past few days, following their phenomenal earnings. The question is: how much more can it go? Well, I put together some quick numbers and it seems it is still very cheap. I focused on Market Cap / Turnover, which is a ratio that I personally like a lot. NVDA |Year|Turnover|Growth| |:-|:-|:-| |2018|11,716|| |2019|10,918|\\-6.8%| |2020|16,675|52.7%| |TTM|19,256|15.5%| |2018-Today||64.36%| |Market Cap|492B|| |MC / TO|25.6|| AMD |Year|Turnover|Growth| |:-|:-|:-| |2018|6,475|| |2019|6,731|3.9%| |2020|9,763|45%| |TTM|13,340|36.6| |2018-Today||106%| |Market Cap|132B|| |MC / TO|9.9|| \u200b As you can see above, MC/TO ratio on NVDIA is almost 3x higher than on AMD despite AMD having higher recent growth. It is obvious that this is not the only ratio that matters and other factors come into play when pricing a stock, but AMD is an incredible growth stock and I strongly believe it will keep crushing on Turnover and closing the MC/TO gap to NVDA. Even a small increase from 9.9 to 12 would mean an additional 20% in stock price assuming current Turnover, which will be history very soon given the rapid growth. Finally, it is important to note that NVDA is up 45% in the past 6 months vs 28% for AMD and this is mostly due to the XLNX acquisition, which brought concerns to investors. Recent numbers from XLNX have given some comfort to the market. TL/DR: AMD still cheap.

{"text": "Buyers of Robinghood are about to get sprayed with stock coming off lock up from every side like that time when the bang bus flipped over just as Ugly gave the money shot. 60 mil shares were sold at $38 in the ipo offering. Employees and Vlad sold around another 10 mil the first. Day. All clear? Nah, the pump is here and now we will see why the dump is coming: The Boy from Bulgaria issued 140 million shares to repay the $3.5 billion emergency loan he took in Feb 2021 to stop his company from being seized by the DTC because they grew users way too fast and didn't raise the capital needed to service that level of business. Story behind the loan is he went to Robinhoods top backers who owned about 1/2 the company and said, \"guys, we're all fluted if you dont come up with $3.5 billion in the next 48 hours\" They said \"frack you, you dumb Boy from Bulgaria. Here's the deal: you have to pledge your shares to us, and when you ipo, this loan becomes shares at a 30% discount to ipo price, we also get 20 mil shares as warrants (calls) good for 10 years after ipo at the same 30% discount strike price ($26.60/share).\" THIS ADDs UP TO 140 MILLION SHARES TO REPAY THE LOAN Vlad said, \"i''m just a boy from bulgaria, i want safety first, so ok\" You can read about the 'lockup' or lack thereof on page 268 of the prospectus: [ But seriously, don't click that sec link!. Not only is there a risk of a virus the SEC computers might have from all the porn sites they visit all day at work, but it was written by some smart alec fluting lawyer, who have all kinds of big words, run on sentences and fancy book learnin talk. here it is in english: Aside from the 70 mil shares sold in the offering and first day: 92 mil more of the 140 mil shares issued to the early backers as payment for the loan are coming for sale in the next 6-8 weeks. Here is why: The loan converted at a discount. In a former life i tried college, i took a tax class. turns out this type of convertible loan has a 'future price' conversion option. That means its conversion price is based off a future price of the stock tbd. (the ipo price). The irs hates this. So the discount (30% to ipo price) is taxed as income gain on the difference from the $26.60 and the $38. They then get to call $38 (the ipo price their tax cost basis). The irs believes this is 30% interest on the 3.5 bil loan. Interest is income profit, so pay income tax! And it is, these shareholders got a 30% bonus of stock for lending vlad the survival money. In short: the bailout shareholders owe the IRS! A slang term for one of these bonds is 'death spiral convertible' The SEC actually has a whole page warning investors to be careful investing in companies who issue these. Thats why HOOD had to kill this horrible loan and hand over 140 mil shares to clear this disastrous and embarrassing mobster like loan off the books, to cleanse them for the ipo. 47 mil of the shares become sellable as soon as HOOD files a form S-1 with the SEC which is planned to happen within 30 days of the ipo. Another 47 mil become sellable 28 days later. 10 mil more employee shares 91 days after ipo, and the rest of the 50 mil shares from the bailout loan 126 days after ipo. There share sales coming are huge, and they are driven by the investors who bailed out HOOD back in feb and had no choice but to dump another $3.5 billion in or watch their beloved boy from bulgaria go tits up. This wasn't real secure long term investment money. The mobster terms they demanded deems some of the stock (30% of the 140 mil shares) a taxable loan interest income. They have to sell the shares to pay it by year end, or risk owing taxes and not having enough money to pay. TLDR; Starting in a few weeks there will be tens of millions of shares coming off lock up from now to year end, and the owners have tax and lets get the flute outa here motivations to sell. You know what to do. Me? I don't like the stock! Edit: What little twinkle toe communist mod changed muh flair to loss? ;-) You are comedy gold MOD.

Most of the stuff mentioned in WSB would traditionally fall within the analyst zone - not the financial Advisor or Planner zone. The DD and TA can be well researched and adhere more to research and analysis principals rather than traditional \u201cFinancial Advisor\u201d services. I\u2019m a CFP (in real life) and operate a financial services practice where I interface with individuals and businesses in order to make great financial decisions. When the WSB commenter scuttled out of the gutter to type with his crabby little claws \u201cNot a financial advisor\u201d, it doesn\u2019t make sense. Financial advisors rarely or never conduct this type of research. We maintain great relationships with actual people and business. We help clients take what they have, add in the tax code and get to their goals - investments, retirement, insurance (life, disability other), annuities. Business succession planning can be one of the most profitable activities in a persons life. I know CFA\u2019s, research analysts and portfolio managers who conduct research similar to that which WSB top contributors conduct and submit. It\u2019s actually not similar - it\u2019s the same. The WSB researchers who produce solid DD are in fact financial analysts. So - my main point is that WSB has shit DD sometimes and that\u2019s not financial analysis. WSB has great research and DD sometimes and that IS true financial research and analysis. It\u2019s based in the reality and usually has sources. \u201cNot a financial advisor\u201d correct - also not a pine cone - we all fucking know you are not a financial advisor. \u201cNot a financial analyst\u201d and your DD is monkey gif based - probably. We assume if you were a financial analyst you would be working at a financial firm doing the exact same thing but posting the DD to a manager. \u201cNot a financial analyst\u201d - but you are actually submitting research - WRONG - you are a financial analyst. You fucking analyze finance for fun. If you wanted to get a job taking in the news and financial filings from public companies - you could. There aren\u2019t always licenses needed to be a researcher. You don\u2019t need to pass many tests to be on a research team.

That while the money they\u2019re making per employer (\u201cQuarterly Paid Employers\u201d in the S1) seeking employees via Zip went up 16% from \\~$1100 to \\~$1275. All in, the company ended 2020 with $86m in net income off of $418m in revenue. ($64m of net income, ignoring a tax benefit.) Their Form 424B4 shows that the March quarter continued this trend, turning an $11m loss (2020) into a $13m profit ($20m). Revenues increased 10+% quarter over quarter. They were $20m cash flow positive for the quarter, with $135m in cash on hand against a little over $25m in convertible notes, the only debt listed. Last: The business. I like that this isn\u2019t a sexy business. The company is profitable and well-capitalized, but what they do (online job marketplace) keeps them under the radar. And we\u2019re at a place where employers are willing to pay out their ears to get warm bodies in seats. See recent headlines like: \u201cMillions of jobs and a shortage of applicants\u201d and \u201cUS job openings hit record 9.2 million but businesses can\u2019t find enough workers to fill them.\u201d Which means ZIP\u2019s customers are going to have more listings (+) and willing to pay even more for each of them (++). So, yep, I\u2019m long ZIP and have steadily bought between $20 and $25.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-08-04 21:46:25", "id": "oxzeet"}
{"text": "Sup Apes, Let me start by saying I possess no brain cells and even less of a clue about the financial markets. That said, I work in the tech sector. Have eyes all around the tech industry on up and coming companies like Confluent. Confluent is a cloud based Kafka-as-a-service company founded by the creators of the open-source Kafka software. Kafka is an event-driven data mobilizer that basically takes data sitting in databases and accelerates it into other systems that use that data for other purposes. We won\u2019t get into the weeds here, let\u2019s just say that companies these days are starting to implement event-driven architecture as a standard for IT. Kafka is widely becoming used, and Confluent is the easy solution for companies that want Kafka but don\u2019t have the manpower or the know-how to manage it. Confluent IPO\u2019ed last month at $44 per share. It\u2019s currently trading around $45 per share, I bought in about a week ago at $39 per share. The fact of the matter is- if Confluent can secure major partnerships with companies that are moving into the cloud, they may well see their share price sky to 3 or 4x their IPO price. This would put it around $130-175 in a year or so.. making it a steal at the moment. The reason I think Confluent will succeed is because a lot of major companies feel the pressure to move to the cloud, and they are adopting the quickest solution which is to sign contracts with cloud vendors who manage the infrastructure for them. It\u2019s a plug and play style of IT and I personally have eyes on a lot of companies making this move right now. ***big disclaimer here because my long term view on this strategy is bearish, I see companies adopting cloud vendors in the next 5 years and moving away from them around that time, meaning that Confluent success may ultimately be short lived.

{"text": "So I am sure that you like me have noticed the recent resurgence of COVID all across the world. Unfortunately, world leaders have not been able to convey the seriousness of the situation but that is neither here nor there. The important fact is that covid infections are rising this means that vaccines are becoming more valuable as an asset. This is why we are seeing moderna skyrocket. However, there is another vaccine play that hasn't really been talked about (as far as I can tell anyway) and it is Ocugen. There are two primary catalysts that I believe will push the stock today and in the coming weeks. First during the earnings call, what they say about their ability to supply the Bharat Vaccine to their customer, and how they see the progression of this third wave of covid infection. The second primary catalyst today comes from some technical analysis which will be dependent on what the earnings call will sound like, if earnings go bad then technicals won't matter. So before we can understand where we are going I think we need to look at the past. So back in February the company spiked on news of a partnership with an Indian biotech firm to distribute the vaccine (COVAXIN) . This vaccine has been tested and approved in Indian, Guyana, Iran, and Mexico on top of several other smaller nations. On top of that they are seeking approval for the vaccine in the United States and Canada. So as for the stock price it obviously bounced in february. Then fell experiencing a typical retraction but picked back up with the rise of covid cases in India. This run was halted when the company disclosed it would be raising capital with a stock offering of nearly 200 million shares pegged at 0.01 that are convertible to common shares. This news resulted in the shorts piling on and bringing the stock down to around 6.50. note that the stock did not reach the previous support level at 5.52 and instead bounced well above those levels. For the final note the shorts, I know you smooth brains love squeezing shorts, and shorts this stock has. As I am writing this the percentage of float short on this stock is about 26%. This is a far cry from other meme stocks but it can provide immense buying pressure nevertheless. Finally for the Technical analysis, now I know some of y\u2019all can\u2019t really wrap your heads around things like volume, or trends, or support but bear with me and hopefully I can explain this to you. So what are the weird lines that are draw on the chart Red lines= A Fibonacci Retracement graph: This is to help identify POSSIBLE places of resistance and support, i placed it between the low and the high of the intraday chart Orange lines= Triangle: I drew a triangle, I tend to draw triangles to identify possible breakouts, this particular triangle is kind of weak so I am not going to put emphasis on it Blue Lines= Simple moving average (20, 50, 200): I use them to identify trend reversal and breakouts usually I look for when they cross or fan out Cup and Handle: There appears to be a cup and handle formation forming and is visible on the 5 minute intraday chart and the 1 minute intra day The most important piece of this TA is the cup and handle IF earnings go well and there is a sustained breakout above 7.63 I\u2019m in.The Trade what I plan on doing is if there is a breakout at the 7.63 level then I am going to hop into some 0DTE $8 calls I will trade them intraday day and set a stop loss for probably 7.30-7.40. If the breakout continues then the next place to watch will be the 7.78 range and if volume and volatility are increasing to the buy side I will probably begin buying some aug 21 9 calls as that is the next resistance level. ( Couple things to note: I am obviously not a financial advisor I\u2019m just a dude with a hobby. TLDR: People getting infected with covid, vaccine value go up, vaccine company value go up, short get squeeze value go up, potential breakout value go up Aug 6 $8 Call Aug 21 $9 Call And maybe some shares idk Edit: grammar", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-08-06 10:30:21", "id": "oz1w1v"}

Both sides are going to suffer the loss of an unprecedented number of jobs and the effect of which is an unimaginable hit in their economies. The best outcome for both cums from co-operation. 3.

{"text": "Ford's shift to Google infotainment software won't put brakes on BlackBerry QNX's ascent: analysts Do not read this post. \"But Rhodes and other analysts were quick to note that BlackBerry QNX is hardly a one-trick pony when it comes to automotive software\". From: [ \"An anchor of Kanata\u2019s autonomous vehicles sector is still in the driver\u2019s seat when it comes to developing emerging AV technology despite Ford\u2019s decision to drop the company\u2019s infotainment platform from its vehicles, industry analysts told OBJ Thursday. The world\u2019s No. 3 automaker made headlines (...) when it announced it was ditching BlackBerry QNX\u2019s system that controlled tasks such as syncing mobile phones for hands-free calling and powering interactive maps in favour of an Android-based platform from Google. That means that starting in 2023, apps such as Google Maps will now be available in millions of Ford and Lincoln vehicles without requiring an Android smartphone. Ford joins a growing number of other car manufacturers, including Volvo, General Motors and the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, that have turned to Google to power their infotainment systems in recent years. As a result, BlackBerry QNX \u200b\u2013 which employs about 400 people at its flagship Kanata R&D facility \u200b\u2013 has seen its share of the infotainment software market fall from nearly 50 per cent in 2017 to 28 per cent last year, according to market research firm IHS Markit. Ford\u2019s move will only hasten that decline. ## Not a one-trick pony \u201cFord was a significant piece of business for QNX \u2013 there\u2019s no doubt about it,\u201d says Brian Rhodes, IHS Markit\u2019s Michigan-based research manager for connected cars, noting that the manufacturer accounted for more than a fifth of QNX\u2019s infotainment software business in 2020. \u201cThere\u2019s a gap there.\u201d But Rhodes and other analysts were quick to note that BlackBerry QNX is hardly a one-trick pony when it comes to automotive software. The company designs a variety of software systems used in cars made by Ford and other manufacturers, including telematics that underpins technology such as GPS navigation systems as well as assisted and autonomous driving platforms. Infotainment is just one of these systems, and experts say its relative importance to BlackBerry QNX\u2019s business is waning. Rhodes notes that the Waterloo-based company has been funnelling many of its resources into enhancing the safety and security of its real-time operating systems. He says BlackBerry QNX is \u201cincredibly strong and getting stronger\u201d at developing secure, connected platforms that control everything from airbags to autonomous parking systems. As an example, he points to BlackBerry\u2019s recent decision to expand its business partnership with Chinese search engine giant Baidu. Under the deal, Baidu\u2019s high-definition maps will be integrated into BlackBerry\u2019s QNX Neutrino real-time operating system in millions of electric cars manufactured by GAC Group, one of China\u2019s top three automakers. \u201cI think that\u2019s exactly how they\u2019re trying to position their business going forward,\u201d Rhodes explains. \u201cIt\u2019s really just phasing into a different part of their business.\u201d Ottawa-based automotive industry expert Barrie Kirk agrees. While calling Ford\u2019s decision unfortunate, Kirk says it wasn\u2019t all that surprising considering the widespread industry shift toward Android-based infotainment systems. He notes that BlackBerry QNX has spent years building a strong reputation for developing secure software focused on other aspects of automotive technology such as autonomous driving systems, adding the company caters to a wide variety of other industries, including the medical sector. ## 'A solid company' \u201cThis is disappointing, but let\u2019s keep it in perspective,\u201d says Kirk, the executive director of the Canadian Automated Vehicles Centre of Excellence. \u201cIt\u2019s a solid company with a broad market and a well-respected product line.\u201d Rhodes adds that while Silicon Valley giants such as Google and others might find it relatively easy to make hay in the realm of infotainment software, building robust operating systems that can stand up to cyber attacks and other security threats is a much tougher nut to crack. And that\u2019s where BlackBerry QNX excels. \u201cThe infotainment space has always been ripe for disruption,\u201d Rhodes explains. \u201cThe barrier to entry certainly needs scale, but there are a lot of tech companies with a lot of scale out there. \u201cThe safety-critical space, you can\u2019t buy 50 years of automotive experience, except (through) acquisition. It\u2019s a more secure position to have that niche in \u2013 no pun intended.\u201d Kirk says he hopes that Ford will continue to collaborate with BlackBerry QNX on other ventures at the automaker\u2019s $340-million Ottawa Research and Engineering Centre on Palladium Drive, which employs hundreds of ex-BlackBerry workers. But no matter what happens, he sees a bright future ahead for a firm that\u2019s shown a knack for weathering storms. \u201cThis is the same BlackBerry that really adjusted very well as its smartphone business diminished,\u201d he says. \u201cThey reinvented themselves in a big way and did a very successful job of that. I\u2019m very confident that they\u2019ll do well, and they'll adjust and keep growing.\u201d TLDR: This is just one example of what is really going on behind the bearish bullshit articles flooding the space. Bb lost the infotainment contract with F but that does not encompass the totality of their working relationship. Articles have been and probably will continue to be framed in a bearish lean for the foreseeable future.

The sell off has considerably slowed down in the last month, and the price has been mostly consolidating between 30 and 40 usd. Better than expected results for the third quarter, and some news announced in the earnings call on the 9th of august have led to a considerable price increase and gap up , which was quickly met with strong selling back down to support. From there, price has once again formed a double bottom and was mostly up in the following 4 or 5 trading days. Overall, volatility and volume are down, which is good news for the bulls, because it indicates that the bears have lost some steam. Let's have a look at the technicals. Price Action Price is currently trading inside two wedge patterns, a small and a big one, indicated in the chart below with red and blue trend lines. If price breaks the upper red line, a rally and a test of the upper resistance of the big wedge (40usd) is likely. If it bounces off that resistance, I expect price to retest the lower red support again (30usd). A break and daily close above 40 would indicate forther upside (target 50 usd), while a break and daily close below would indicate further downside (target 25 usd) MACD The daily MACD has turned green for the first time since june. The moving averages are crossing. Overall the MACD suggest the momentum is shifting to the upside. RSI There is a bullish divergence in the RSI (Matching RSI lows while second price low was lower than the first), as well as a double bottom. Overall, the RSI indicates a decreasing bearish momentum and suggests that a (at least temporary) bottom might be in. TLDR - Points of interest Long Positions: I am looking for an entry around 30 USD if price falls down there again. I am also looking for a break of the upper red resistance for a rally to 40. If 40 breaks, I am looking at 50. Short Positions: I am looking at a bounce either off the upper red resistance back to 30, or if that resistance breaks, a bounce off the upper blue resistance back to either the upper red trendline, or if that breaks, 30 usd.

{"text": "I am a dentist and this is the honest truth about smile direct club; A few years ago, 99% of dentist were against smile direct, primarily because we did not know anything about the structure of how they work. All we knew was that someone was moving patients teeth without our authorization or pre-approval. As time has passed, many dentists including myself has opened our eyes and gained a lot of knowledge about what exactly smile direct does. They move teeth that are in the mild/moderate cases. Which means that severe cases would still need traditional braces. That is totally fine by me. If a patient comes to my office with a slightly curved front tooth, then why would I not want to save her $5-6000 (the cost of Invisalign) when she can get that corrected easily with smile direct ($1900). It\u2019s ethically wrong of me not to offer this to my patients, and greed does not belong in healthcare! Now let\u2019s proceed to the continuous negative sentiment from my fellow dental-colleagues. Orthodontics is a VERY exclusive private sector which has for 100 years kept their work for themselves and even during dental school they did not want to teach general dentists much about it. So you can imagine the threat they felt when they suddenly see that a company is eating off their plate. (Loss of $income!). They have gone full force against smiledirect in all ways possible, including legally! Smile direct club has so far won every single legal case brought against them, with the most recent one being against the dental boards of Georgia. It\u2019s important to understand that many dentist will claim that it\u2019s \u201cunsupervised\u201d, which I can tell you first hand it is not. When patients come to my clinic, I do a full exam, including cavity and periodontally clearing my patients before possibly referring them to SDC. Now, If patients decide to go directly to a smile shop (and not through a dentist), then they would fill out paperwork where they are clearly asked if they have seen a dentist and been cleared. If patient is self neglective and chooses to lie then clearly the only one doing harm to themselves here is the patient, and not SDC. Let\u2019s continue my thoughts about the stock; the stock with an IPO of $22 in 2019 has been slammed by short sellers (many suspecting Invisalign competitor being a big part of it). Currently there is a 28% short interest in sdc! That is huge when it comes to a potential short squeeze. Smile direct have focused on growth and expansion, so all of their income has gone back in to their business. So they have not even attempted to show profitability, since growth has been priority. In January of 2020, invisalign lost their patent to work directly with dentists in dental offices, so SDC are now growing their partnerships with dental offices directly at a high pace! In their most recent earnings they said they are signed up with 1,800 DSO dental offices. Which is huge! See link of Invisalign patent expiration below; Furthermore, smile direct has signed an exclusive partnership with Walmart to sell their products in their stores. Now also in CVS stores. See links below: \u203a investingWeb resultsSmileDirectClub signs exclusive deal to sell dental care at Walmart - CNN Smile direct has recently also focused on international expansion which includes US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Mexico, Austria, Spain, Netherlands, Hong Kong and Singapore.

{"text": "This article first appeared on SchiffGold has become one of the most anticipated data points each month. The CPI has become a controversial measure over the years. Many correctly point out that it is continuously refined to lower the inflation readings using mechanisms like Owners Equivalent Rent and goods substitution. This makes sense from a strategic standpoint as inflation expectations have shown that they can cause inflation to increase. Thus understating inflation can rein in expectations. Even though the inflation methodology is controversial, this analysis uses the data within the CPI (indexes and weightings) to recalculate the inflation rate from a sub-category level. This allows better insight into what is driving the price changes as the charts below show. For more detail on inflation based on the way it used to be calculated before the modifications, see Shadow Stats. Note: Inflation by definition is the expansion of the money supply but for this article it will refer to rising prices. Recent Trends The latest seasonally adjusted month over month inflation rate was .47%, with non-seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.37%. The biggest reason for the fall from June\u2019s .91% pace was a significant drop in Commodities and Transportation. Specifically, Commodities fell due to a collapse in used car increases from 10.5% in June to 0.2% in July. The fall in Transportation was driven by a few month over month factors: Car Rentals from 5.2% to -4.6%, Insurance from 1.2% to -2.8%, and Airline Fares from 2.7% to -0.1%. So, does this prove that inflation was \u201ctransitory\u201d? Most likely not, as shown below. \u200b The year over year chart below does highlight the dramatic impact of Commodities (Used Cars) and Energy. It is unlikely that used cars will continue moving up and may even revert lower as more supply comes on the market. However, it is also unlikely that Oil will reverse and may actually continue to increases in the months ahead. Furthermore, as eviction moratoriums inevitably end, rents are going to push higher to compensate landlords for lost rent. Finally, there are major supply issues and port constraints that will not alleviate in the near future, it is likely that the high costs will be passed to consumers in the months ahead. \u200b The plot below compares the recent numbers with the year over year monthly average. This chart further highlights that many items are still increasing in price. The blue bar shows the most recent period and the orange bar is the 12 month average. In almost all categories, the blue bar is higher except for the items mentioned above (commodities, specifically used cars, and transportation). \u200b The table below gives a more detailed breakdown of the numbers. It shows the actual figures reported by the BLS side by side with the recalculated and unrounded numbers. The weighted column shows the contribution each value makes to the aggregated number. Some key takeaways: Shelter doubled MoM from .2 to .43. YoY the jump was 2.34 to 2.79. This is where Owners Equivalent rent is a farce. Many articles have been written showing rents are rising much faster. Eventually the surveys will pick up on this because obviously the housing market is rising way faster than 2.79% YoY. Food is up MoM from -.3 to +.72. Food does tend to be volatile, so hard to know if these prices will remain. YoY food has actually fallen from 4.07% down to 3.44% The big MoM drop in transportation can be seen from +2.76% to -1.09% Again, this could be due to slowing demand as a result of the Delta variant. YoY the base effect is still having an impact showing Transport up 6.22% vs -3.79%. Finally, even though everyone is already claiming this latest report shows June was the peak, a look at the MoM diff tells a different story. Almost half the categories are still increasing in price. It\u2019s very possible this is the start of the earlier price increases making their way into the broader economy. \u200b VALIDATING THE RECALCULATION Recalculating the BLS number is not a perfect science. The weightings must be scraped from the web pages. The index data is then gathered using an API. Each index comes seasonally adjusted and unadjusted. To validate the recalculation there are three variables shown below: The Actual Reported number A number calculated using the All Items index that is Unrounded A number recalculated using the sub-category levels and doing a weighted average sum The chart below shows the recalculation is very accurate compared to the reported numbers. \u200b Historical Perspective The BLS weightings have only been scraped back to 2012, thus the chart below shows the past 9 years of annual inflation data. The volatility in Energy can be seen clearly over this time period. The base effect in transportation (purple) can also be seen with the decreases in 2020 followed by the increases in 2021. Finally, the impact of used cars on commodities (light blue) can also be seen clearly in the more recent period. \u200b The historical weightings show that there is not much change overtime across categories. It also shows the massive weighting given to Shelter which is why Owners Equivalent Rent has had such a strong impact on anchoring reported inflation. \u200b What is the Fed looking at? Finally the Fed publishes data going back to the 1950s. Unfortunately they do not publish the weightings of each category so it would be impossible to do a similar analysis showing the impact of each category on the overall number. The Fed categories are slightly different because they do not separate energy into it\u2019s own category. Regardless, the top line number at the Fed matches the BLS CPI as expected. Looking at history back to 1950 puts the current spike into perspective. The last time the economy saw a spike similar to the current one was in 2008. Inflation was tempered then by the Global Financial Crisis. What is going to stop the explosion in prices this time? Especially with the Fed continuing to grow it\u2019s balance sheet. Even if the blue bar continues shrinking for Transportation, the Fed still has to hope all the other categories also prove to be transitory. That is a lot to hope for, because if they are wrong, it will be impossible to fight inflation. \u200b TL;DR CPI may be less transitory than the Fed thought as many categories are still exhibiting growth even after the transitory factors have come back down (e.g. used cars). With PPI surging by 1% as reported this morning, it is only a matter of time before producers pass cost onto consumers. Additionally, if Owners Equivalent Rent starts to reflect the true price of rent increases, then the CPI is going to rock higher. Unfortunately for the Fed, ( and cannot scale back the monetary stimulus without devastating the economy. Thus, the Fed is not going to fight inflation because it can't. Instead they will keep telling everyone inflation is transitory and hope they are right. If inflation expectations start to increase then it's game over for the Fed because everyone will realize they have been bluffing. Protect yourself with gold and silver. Both remain under pressure as the market anticipates the Fed to tighten. Once they don't tighten, the bull market will resume.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-08-12 18:39:52", "id": "p32dxw"}

Typically, web sites have been served up via servers or virtual servers maintained in data centers all over the world. CDNs, Contend Delivery networks have improved the performance of those web sites considerably, by bringing certain resources closer to the user. The shift I am speaking about, involves a movement to use the CDNs for the entire website experience. You develop the site via JamStack like NextJS or Fauna You deliver it to a CDN via tools like Netlify and boom, the site is 90x faster. Yes data still travels between the user and the web site user interface, however, using things like client side caching alleviates the time and labor on the site down to changes only after the first load. The CDN of choice lately is CloudFlare. They are coming up fast behind the big players like Akamai. Again, just my thoughts based on my experience in this industry.

{"text": "Preamble: Ahh, a tale as old as time. Two legions of believers destined to be eternally entwined in battle! On one side we have those who swear by the active fund managers and their superior returns. On the other, we have those who trust the good old index fund with all their life savings! b. Average fund performance (1, 3, 5, 10 & 20 years \u2013 Both Equal and Asset Weighted) The above analysis should give us conclusive evidence on which approach is better both in the short as well as long term. Results pulled one over us! . While this is a very small amount (0.03% for Vanguard SP500 ETF) when compared to actively managed funds (0.7-2%), it might change our final results slightly. But I don\u2019t think it would in any way affect the overall results as the expense ratio is negligible for index funds. Return Comparison considering fees Since some of us would have a lingering question on the impact of the index fund fee, I did some calculations on the difference in return over 20 years if you invested in different funds. (The Index returns here are calculated after incorporating the fees \u2013 0.03%) whereas with index funds you will be replicating exactly what the market is going through. But then again as we can see from our analysis, only <15% of funds \\ beat the market in the long run (20 years). As we can see from the trends, longer time periods only work against the active fund managers. The chances of the fund making the right decision year over year reduce which is why it\u2019s good to remember that past performance cannot be indicative of future returns. So, to conclude, in almost all the cases, you would be better off just sticking to a passive index fund and letting it ride! Footnotes \\ The data provided by SPIVA is accounted for survivorship bias, compares similar funds to its benchmark rather than comparing all types to SP500, and has also split its returns into both asset and equal-weighted methods. A detailed explanation for each is given in their official scorecard. \\ This analysis would be limited to the data directly provided in the SPIVA report as they have not shared the raw data used in the analysis. \\ Even if 86% of all funds underperformed the market over the last 20 years, what if the rest 14% created so much alpha that on avg returns actively managed funds beat the market? \\ The chances of you picking the correct fund that will outperform the market in the next 20 years are very close to the chance of you predicting the correct number in a die throw! You can check your luck ( As always, please note that I am not a financial advisor.

He was telling the lady how inflation is a good thing. She said how come inflation keeps going up but minimum wage never rises? He ignored her and pulls out a large sheet of $1 bills. He asks if she had scissors but she said no. He looked back at me and saw the eggs and said \"You workout huh? It's good to stay healthy.

{"text": "Disclosure: I own stock and LEAPS There are a few catalysts that could drive the price in both directions, hard to say where but i will share the info. 1. Revenue - H1 and Q2 2021 will beat H1 and Q2 2020 due to Covid and new state launches but will not smash Q1 2021. - They lost market share in many states and they also had lower margin - igaming (online casino) did ok but no spectacular growth there - MI might help as they launched at the end of Jan so that gives them now a full extra month to compare vs Q1 I would not be surprised if revenue grows by single digit or low two digits vs Q1 2021. 2. Things I don't care about: - New marketplace and social features - these do not drive growth. 3. What they will say and what actually matters: - They completed the migration from Kambi a few weeks ago with no real issues, going forward they can save 2-6% out of the sportsbetting revenue as they will not pay a platform fee. Also they will be able to build more features and they own their own stack. - They launched Same Game Parlay and that will help them with margin. All of their main competitors have this and DKNG has been suffering from this gap. - New States: Arizona and Connecticut will launch this year, CT will be meaningful as it has also igaming and it's a two horse market, them and FanDuel. - NY: they will announce that they will take part in the NY RFA and that they believe they will get a license. The results will be announced in December and I believe it will give the stock a boost, even if only temporary. - Canada: Ontario passed a bill and they are well set to launch as soons as the market opens, using their own (SBTech) platform The above points should drive revenue growth, cost savings and higher margin. What will happen tomorrow? -I have no idea but this is my play: -if the stock goes up to $53-54 i will sell most of my positions as i think the price is already inflated. -if the stock goes down, I will buy calls for Jan and Feb banking on the NY news.

{"text": "Rule #1 Playing By Sector Pattern Is Not Always Safe AMZN reported impressive earnings, beating top and bottom but dropped significantly after earning. It was due to extremely high expectation, lowered Q3 revenue forecast, and big run up before the earning. And it happened to Wayfair. The same pattern also applies to ETSY. If you bought ETSY PUTs before earning and sold right after it opened, it's a two bagger. At this point, you probably become really confident that same pattern is going to apply to EBAY. Online e-commerce, great growth in Q1, stock price close to ATH, and likely will have lowered Q3 guidance. You are right, absolutely right and EBAY actually did much worse than AMZN, ETSY, and W. It not only has soft Q3 guidance but also missed revenue and the active buyers dropped by 2%. However, the stock price did not drop more than 2% after the call and today at close, it actually closed green. At the end, IV fuked both calls and puts. Another example is SOFI v.s. UPST. Their business overlaps and UPST up hugely after the earning. Many here bought SOFI shares and calls and think they will print but instead they get fuked. Rule #2 It's All About Expectation Wall Street is fine for EBAY missing revenue and user growth and soft Q3 guidance because we all know EBAY is not a hot e-commerce platform like AMZN with great growth story. If you can choose to work for one company, will you choose to work for AMZN to revolutionize cloud technologies or for EBAY to sell Pokemon cards online? Rule #3 Look For Potential Surprise Factors And Stocks Without Too Much Runup Before Earning PLTR and DIS did great after earning. I've been joking about PLTR \"Forever 22\" for a while. And here you go, a stock without too high an expectation (reflecting in stock price) and been flat for a while. And boom, 90% growth in commercial sector and beating the expectation, 10% up in a day. DIS had a difficult year and stock been trailing behind other blue chips. No one seems to talk about it and buying force is weak. And DIS delivered first profitable quarter since Covid started, parks printing cash, crazy growth in subscribers (170M) as well.

{"text": "This post isn't about moons, rockets, or short squeezes. [ # BACKGROUND INFO 23andMe has been trading on the NASDAQ for just over a month. Prior to being listed as $ME - it was being traded as a SPAC - A shell company created by Sir FUCKING Richard Branson a.k.a. the biggest virgin on the planet. (Owner of Virgin Atlantic Airways and Virgin Mobile and a bunch of other companies). If you don't know, 23andMe is a saliva based testing kit which can be sent to your home. It's completely retard-friendly. All you have to do is send them a sample of your already overflowing drool. With this sample, they can complete genetic testing and analyze changes in DNA structure and sequence. According to the 23andMe kit I am 69% Neanderthal. This explains my sloped forehead and why I dream in IMAX. When it was announced that Richard Branson's SPAC would acquire 23andMe - it shot up to a high of $18.16 from an average of $10. (This was prior to 23andMe even being listed.) After the initial rise and fall, the price settled back to $10 and was kept there until the shareholders could vote on the acquisition of 23andMe. 23andMe is backed not only by Richard Branson but is headed by CEO and co-founder of $ME - Anne Wojcicki. She is sister to Susan Wojcicki (Current CEO of Youtube). Anne was also married for a while to Sergey Brin (co-founded of Google). She developed 23andMe after working as a health care investment analyst for a San Francisco investment fund . She was displeased with the way investment firms viewed biotech's and set out to create her own world-changing company. # POTENTIAL Originally, 23andMe offered tests which would map out your genetic make-up i.e. your ancestry. God knows your ancestors who migrated from Africa hundreds of thousand of years ago are looking down on you with immense shame. In 2015 the FDA gave 23andMe approval for tests which could include various types of cancers, Alzheimer's, cystic fibrosis, Parkinson's, sickle cell anemia, Gaucher's disease, early onset dystonia, and many more hereditary ailments. Also in 2015 they announced a partnership with GlaxoSmithKlien to use the genetic mapping of over 5 million customers to design new drugs. In 2020 GlaxoSmithKlien announced their first joint clinical trial regarding cancer treatment - working with client DNA they had gotten from 23andMe. $ME has a potential DATA MINE of genetic information. Imagine knowing if a certain illness runs in your family and your own propensity for it - with information like this ahead of time, one can be more easily prepared and can catch it even before symptoms start. Easy to use and streamlined tests like this are the future. The technology will only get better and medications will only improve with the amount of people opting to have their DNA analyzed further by 23andMe & their partners. # METRICS / DATES 23andMe TEST KITS WERE ONE OF THE TOP 5 SELLERS THIS YEAR ON AMAZON'S PRIME DAY. AUGUST 13th, 2021 - 11:00AM EDT is 23andMe's 2nd Quarter Earnings Call! As I said before - the price went from $10 to a high of $18.16 even before the merger. Yesterday $ME closed at $8.23 (Ending in the aftermarket at $8.35). This is LOWER than pre-merger prices and we're still in the EARLY DAYS of the company. Put in a stop loss and see where this thing goes. The long-term upside is enormous and the downside is scarce. You'd currently be paying LESS than what early investors paid. 52 week HIGH - 18.16 52 week LOW - 7.72 $3.19B MARKET CAP \\--- Get in low while you can. Now would be a great time to buy ahead of earnings. My positions: Maybe if we all come together, we can have the 23 chromosomes required to be labeled as a 'normal functioning human being.' \u200b TL;DR & ELI5: 23andMe ($ME) has huge names behind it. Potential is high. Earnings are on the 13th. Prices are a steal.

{"text": "I. Introduction Sorry for the wall of text - but if you are serious about trading please read through this - I think you all could really benefit from a bit of intermarket analysis - and I see way too many victims of ignorance here who could prevent their losses by understanding these relatively simply concepts. This sub is primarily focused on IWM names (Russell 2000/Small Caps). If you look at that stock - it's been sideways for almost a year. No secret you all have been losing tons of money as of late on your favorite names (Except MVST - nice one there). In my eyes - for the best probability of success - you always want to be playing the names that are within the strongest index at the time (or simply playing the strongest index itself). I determine which is the strongest via charting plus some simple intermarket relationships. Last year during the recovery we got a huge everything rally \\- that is not usually the case. Money constantly rotates from sector to sector - this is how it usually is - and how it's been for most of 2021. For instance - notice today (8/102021) tech is dropping while financials, materials and other inflation camp names are pumping. This is one of many useful correlations. # II. The Indices The indices are large groups of stocks lumped in together that usually move in unison. Most of you probably already know this. I'm just going to list out what each index is and what it focuses on. S&P 500 (SPY, SPX, ES) from Wikipedia \"The Standard and Poor's 500, or simply the S&P 500, is a stock market index that tracks 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It is one of the most commonly followed equity indices.\" Basically a compilation of most large caps in the United States. Great gage of overall market health - and sort of a cross between the other two large cap indexes (Nasdaq 100, Dow Jones). Nasdaq 100 (QQQ, NDX, NQ) from Wikipedia \"The Nasdaq-100 is a stock market index made up of 102 equity securities issued by 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock market. It is a modified capitalization-weighted index. \" These are going to be mostly your large cap growth names (tech stocks) - but there are a few boomer names in there. Just more heavy on the growth side than the other indexes. Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA, DJIA, YM) from Wikipedia \"The Dow Jones Industrial Average, Dow Jones, or simply the Dow, is a price-weighted measurement stock market index of 30 prominent companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States.\" These are going to be your \"boomer\" names - I like to call it the boomer index. Value, materials, healthcare etc. Not really any growth names in there (except AAPL, CRM I guess). One thing I like to note is that all the names in Dow Jones are present in the S&P 500 - the Dow is the most closely correlated index to the S&P (about a 0.92 correlation iirc). Russell 2000 Index (IWM, RUT, RTY) from Wikipedia \"The Russell 2000 Index is a small-cap stock market index of the smallest 2,000 stocks in the Russell 3000 Index. It was started by the Frank Russell Company in 1984. The index is maintained by FTSE Russell, a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group.\" These are all your small cap names. There is also a Russell 1000 and Russell 3000. Notice how many more companies are in here than the other indexes. This one isn't going to be moved by one or two stocks. Small caps usually benefit from risk on environments (they are perceived to be riskier) - but note the more speculative growth ones will lag in those situations. These are also meme stocks - pretty much every single one is in a Russell Index. If you are someone who likes to play memes - you always want to watch IWM. When this one is popping off is when they will be making a run. # III. Risk On vs Risk Off (Inflation vs Deflation Camp) Moving onto more practical applications of this information. I could do a section on Forex, Bonds, etc. - but honestly you only need to know what they are to apply the analysis that I do. The primary narrative driving the market in recent times is whether we are getting inflation or deflation - and this has dictated the flow of money. Risk On (Inflation Camp) Risk-On is described as a rotation from save haven assets into riskier assets. If market participants believe in high inflationary pressures, they will want to invest their cash into \"risk\" assets including, stocks, real estate etc. to combat the residual effects of inflation on their money. Additionally, they believe we are now in a rising rate environment (rates already at zero, likely to increase in the future), which would help benefit value stocks, financials/banks, energy, specific forex/currencies, anything that benefits from low rates (currently). More specifically, banks benefit from a gradual steady increase in interest rates. Banks make an interest rate spread on deposits received versus money lent. In a rising rate environment, they are able to pay lower interest on their deposits and make a larger spread on their loans. Commodities, materials (energy), and consumer/defensive stocks benefit from inflation as they are able to pass on rising costs to consumers. Additionally, value/defensive stocks typically have a strong track-record of recurring dividends and share buybacks to provide yield to shareholders. Conversely, in later stages of rising rates, investors may divest from growth or tech stocks because rising rates have a direct effect on liquidity and cost of capital. When rates are high, debt is heavier and money is more expensive. AUD/JPY is an easy forex pair to watch for risk on movements based on the Australian economy in relation to Japan. AUD is seen as a \"risk\" currency, whereas JPY is seen as a \"safe haven\". When AUDJPY is increasing, typically this is a sign of \"risk-on\". This is only one of many pairs to watch for in Forex Markets, considering Forex Markets are much larger than the stock market. Remember, in the early stages of inflation, small caps or tech stocks will perform well because the negative impact of inflation on sitting in cash; however, if the federal reserve is required to combat hyper/stagflation worries, they will raise rates and growth or tech stocks may perform poorly in that environment. Furthermore, Dow Jones Industrial Average (boomer) names will usually outperform, and investors today may be pricing-in this effect. Equities as a whole will generally do well in a risk-on environment. Stocks are considered a hedge for inflation, but watch-out for JPOW and his antics later on. Risk Off (Deflation Camp) This is the opposite of risk-on. Money rotates out of risk assets into safe havens. People in the deflation corner believe inflation is transitory, asset prices will decline, and virtually assume the Federal Reserve won't have to raise rates. In low inflation or deflationary environment, money flows to safe haven assets out of risk assets. Participants would hoard cash (increasing in value) and wait for asset prices to decline. They would invest in bonds, safe haven currencies, speculate on an increase in volatility, and save cash to reinvest later. In recent times - growth performs well here because when interest rates are low - money is cheaper to borrow. Growth depends on debt to continue it's operations. Most of them also don't make money and so they have no yield. An increase in interest rates will raise the cost of capital making it harder for companies to generate higher returns. With rising rates, a company has to pay a higher interest expense that lowers their overall profitability. Lower profits lead to lower cash flows, which lead to a higher required rate of return for investors, all of which lead to a lower valuation for the company's share price. Note this is primarily due to recent macroeconomic events - and in the past all equities have been considered risk on. Bonds outperform because investors believe rates to remain low or fall further. They'd be able to receive a \"higher\" interest rate today versus in the future. Bonds are typically safer than equity because they are first in-line in the event of a liquidation (bankruptcy) and earn a fixed rate of return. Additionally, the USD, JPY, CHF perform well because they are a 'safe-haven' currency. The US Dollar is still considered the world's reserve currency. (Trust in the US Economy/Risk Free) In addition, deflation has a natural increase in the dollar's value. The VIX performs well because it's essentially a measure of how hedged SPX players are. If you are expecting deflation in assets - you are expecting prices to drop for the most part - and so you want to be hedged on your long positions (or make straight bear bets). In Summary Today, the Federal Reserve has created a low interest rate environment to stimulate the economy; through allowing participants to borrow funds \"cheaper\" or lower rates. This stimulates demand, supply, borrowing, lending... overall growth. Asset prices are attempting to \"price-in\" the future state of the economy. If you believe that inflation is here to stay, then you'd want to shift into risk-assets. If you believe that inflation is 'transitory', then you'd want to move towards safe haven assets. Ultimately, you could assume that the Federal Reserve controls the narrative and that any major movements in the flow of money, cost of debt (change in rates), could have a positive or negative impact on asset prices. In either scenario (in the future), inflation can lead to higher interest rates causing a drop in asset prices or deflation worries can keep interest rates low and fuel the rally for longer than one would expect. I hope that makes sense. Financials Commodities Value Materials Real Estate Basically Most Equities AUD/JPY (AND OTHER RISK-ON CURRENCY PAIRS) Bonds Dollar VIX Growth/Disruptor Equities (SOMETIMES - THIS IS A NEW CORRELATION STEMMING FROM COVID MAKING TECH NAMES SAFE HAVENS AMONG OTHER UNPRECEDENTED FACTORS) # IV. Practical Applications First let me go over the tickers I watch for each rotation - YM (DIA) RTY (IWM) CL (Crude Oil Futures) ZC (Corn Futures) AUD/JPY DXY (Dollar Index) ZB (30 Year Treasury Bonds) TNX (10 Year Treasury Index) VIX (The \"Fear Index\") NQ (QQQ) Glancing at a watchlist of these will give you a quick picture of where money is flowing at the moment - but in order to predict the odds of future movements (and more profitable ones) - I perform technical analysis on all of these names. Basically - I analyze all the indices and only play the one that is the strongest from a technical standpoint. I further filter these signals and determine position sizing by analyzing their correlated assets. For instance - if DIA is breaking out - and ZB is breaking down - this is confluence for a risk on rotation. The more confluence - the higher probability you have of success in any play. On the contrary, if DIA is breaking out - and ZB is rallying - this is a sign one of the moves is likely fake - and a signal I have lower odds of success. Subsequently, I want to size smaller. Let's take a look at one example in which QQQ (Growth, Risk Off) caught the rotation this past May. This is a perfect example of Bonds and Growth moving in unison to provide a high probability long trade in QQQ and TLT. Note: I just use trendlines and volume for my technical analysis. No indicators. QQQ - The red circle is Nasdaq on 5/13. You can see that is the day it bottomed - and every day since then pretty much Nasdaq and Growth assets have been leading. Not only that - but on 6/22 it broke a huge technical setup (the big red line) - which triggered a ton more upside. TLT - The red circle here is also 5/13. You can see that is also the day that TLT (ZB or Bonds) bottomed - and every day since then except for the past three days - it's held the same uptrend. Not only that - but on 6/22 it also broke that big red line - which was a downtrend stemming from last year - triggering more upside here as well. We also broke out of that teal symmetrical triangle, which provided more confluence for the move. I try to assign a signal strength to each move in order to make it easier for my monkey brain to understand. Indexes: 3 Bonds: 2 Everything Else: 1 You will see a lot of people say bonds are everything - and in my experience that is very true. Last year we had an extremely odd situation where risk parity was fucked - but in recent times it has come back. Correlations almost always revert to the mean at some point. Subsequently - you could watch just bonds and the indices and efficiently track the flow of money. # V. Divergences Correlations are not perfect. If they were - everyone would be a billionaire. There are times when we get divergences and things move opposite of the way they usually do. Like I said - they almost always revert to the mean at some point - but the catch is the divergence could blow your account before it reverts back. If you are good with technicals you can easily spot when a setup you are trying to play breaks down and stop loss accordingly - but the key point here is always have a stop loss when playing correlations. Lots of people think they can average down infinitely and eventually profit off the arbitrage that comes with assets reverting to the mean - but the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. # IV. TL;DR The main thing to takeaway here is the indices. If QQQ is weak - maybe you want to take a look at DIA. If IWM is sideways - maybe you want to take a look at QQQ. Keep your head on a swivel and don't be too biased towards one sector. If you can effectively track the flow of money - you can theoretically catch every rotation. Also - you don't have to apply the technicals I do to track it. That's just my method. Lot's of people use complex macroeconomic analysis to assess these sorts of things, among other methods. I'm just too smooth brained for that. I hope this helped you all - and if anyone has questions drop it in the comments. \\--- Edit: One final note since I know the more advanced people will likely comment on this. I know QQQ/Growth has not always been risk off - this is a new thing. I was trying to explain things from the perspective of recent times as correlations shift with macroeconomic changes. We haven't had a true deflationary environment in over a decade - and subsequently the market rotations have been more about pricing in rate hikes/rate cuts than rotating in and out of equities as a whole.

{"text": "It's time for volatility, a new high, and a new low. Place your bets on SPY before Wednesday because that's when things will pop off. Discussing the following stuff below: GEX/DIX, Elliott wave, general TA GAMMA / DARK POOL: -GEX is the lowest it has been in a while, and the DIX is on the rise to test it's highest high. This setup of burning off excess gamma and the index pattern matches April 15th 2021 - May 12th, but on a slightly larger timeframe. I believe this is happening because dealers are holding cash liquid (that was sold after a bad CPI report, but prior to earnings, July 13-19) with hedges already placed on the market. Depending on the report of the CPI, they will place their bets on the megacaps, incides, and other analyzed securities. When GEX has a new low and DIX has a new high at the same time, it's time to buy. ELLIOTT WAVE: We are nearing the end of the last leg of an uptrending Elliott Wave that's been going on since late March of 2021: First leg ~ March 26-Sept 1st Second leg ~ Sept. 2nd - Oct 30th. Third Leg ~ Nov 3 - May 6th Fourth leg ~ May 10 - Jun 18 Final leg ~ June 18 - Aug 18. Then we'll enter a period of consolidation on the large Elliott wave which will help bring speculative prices back down closer to true value. This is where I think we will see the return to low 400's on SPY. This is NOT the big, Burry-pocalyptic one. TECHNICALS: RSI on SPX is at a healthy 61.3 on dailies and touching 70 on weeklies. I don't have much to say about the daily RSI other than it has room for growth and is expected to catch up to my trendline on the weekly chart. A bad CPI report will probably bump it down to 41-42 level like the previous 3 times. I am confident in one final push of growth on the weekly RSI as it will test the all time high (set in early may) and give way to a lower low which, at this point, is only 69.5 (and the next big low is like 5 points below that)The volatility of a quick rise up to 455 and fall to 410 will allow SPX to maintain a more realistic RSI while maintaining an uptrend. Megacaps are all due for a short term rise to test ATH from technical standpoint, plus most of them had positive ERs, or some good news in terms of short term trading. TL;DR: Following a positive CPI (below M/M inflation) report on Wednesday, SPY will go to 450-55 by Aug 18th-20th. Then it will quickly retrace down to 415-405 area in the first 2 weeks of september and then consolidate into ~ Oct 1st. If CPI is higher than expected, we will see a quick gap down like in may/june/july to 435 followed by a failed retesting of ATH into the first two weeks of September, then falling down to 425 area into the first week of October.

Once Marqeta has these companies as clients, the don\u2019t enough of a shit to go and find other card issuing solutions, since Marqeta does it all. Marqeta\u2019s website. Additionally, 74 of the top 100 merchants accepted Apple Pay. Marqeta also recently partnered with Google to provide cards for their ( platform. This will make MQ even more valuable, since consumers can get an account and start spending instantly, both online and in person. To recap: MQ is working with Uber, Google, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Affirm, and other big companies to, what is likely, permanently provide card issuing solutions for them.

{"text": "Listen up, everyone! You\u2019re all probably thinking, \u201cWTF why Crocs? Their clogs are so ugly!\u201d (Ticker: $CROX) Well, despite the fact that they may have some footwear that isn\u2019t the most attractive, they as a business are doing incredibly well and I\u2019m sure most of you can put your feelings aside if there's some upside potential. Crocs has had a very volatile history as a publicly-traded stock. They nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis back in \u201808 but managed to survive. Their stock price was then pretty range-bound for nearly a decade before finally in the last few years started moving in the right direction. Then during COVID, they seemed to gain some serious recognition through their support of healthcare workers: Revenue grew 93.3% YoY (a near double!) and 39% sequentially (QoQ)! That\u2019s a huge acceleration from what was already a very strong Q1 report of 63.6% YoY. Non-GAAP Net Income doubled YoY and maintained the trend of 22% net income margins Non-GAAP EPS doubled from a year ago which means their trailing twelve months of EPS is nearly triple from what it was a year ago! Their shares outstanding also dropped 5% YoY from their accelerated share repurchases program, so high EPS and share buybacks generally means more share appreciation Gross Margins increased by 600 basis points QoQ and 700+ basis points YoY to 61.7%, for some context, 60%+ gross margins is REALLY high, especially for retail. Nike for example has 45.8% gross margins, Lululemon has 57.1% gross margins. Their gross margins have been ticking up since Q1 of last year Operating income came in at $195 M which represents 30% operating margins which is really good. This is the highest operating margin they\u2019ve ever in the past 5 years at leastt (as far as I looked). Their Wholesale business is on fire, in the Americas region, it increased 150% YoY and APAC/EMEA weren\u2019t too shabby at 76.4 and 82.6% respectively Their direct-to-consumer business is doing really well too. With Americas revenue going up 128% YoY. Their last 3 quarters of D2C Americas YoY growth were: 80.4%, 131.3% and 128.1%, so the second consecutive quarter of triple digit growth. In addition, what\u2019s really encouraging is that their APAC and EMEA D2C businesses are starting to show some life with APAC which has been struggling since COVID turned out nearly 11% YoY growth and theiR EMEA business is now doing \\~30% YoY growth. There is a huge opportunity for Crocs to expand internationally From a cash flow perspective, they generated $212 M in cash flow which is really good seeing how they only generated $30 M last quarter and only $267 M in cash in ALL OF 2020. GUIDANCE was 60-70% revenue growth for Q3 and 60-65% YoY revenue growth for 2021 which means Q4 will have 35% YoY revenue growth. Since Crocs has historically beaten their revenue guidance, this means Crocs will stand to grow revenue 70%+ in 2021 and despite a tough comparison in Q4, will still stand to grow revenue by 35%+. Let\u2019s now talk about what management is thinking: 1. They are going to increase marketing spend and increase it a lot. The goal is to spend 7% of total revenue on marketing in the back half of Q2, which will likely amount to $100+ M assuming they keep up growth figures, this is a HUGE increase from their $28 M in marketing spend in Q1 & Q2 combined. 2. They expect to see strong growth in all regions and in all channels as brand momentum continues. 3. They will have net zero emissions by 2030, so a lot of people who invest in companies, this is a plus for Crocs 4. They expect the strong international growth to continue Fundamentally, this is a company that just had a very strong Q2 where their stock increased another 10%+ the next day. Remember, this stock is up 100%+ YTD already, so a lot of share price appreciation has been priced in and yet it continues to impress with such strong earnings results. Assuming Crocs continues to outperform their guidance which they have in the past 4 quarters, Crocs will continue to see big EPS gains which will continue to be a boost for the company\u2019s share price. As with any stock, there are risks: 1. COVID continues to be a problem and may impact their supply chain 2. They increased their LT debt to $386 M after issuing a $350 M note, this is the highest level of debt they\u2019ve had in the past few years. We\u2019re in a low-interest-rate environment, so this should be fine, but something to monitor 3. Inventories increased to $209 M which is the highest level of inventory the company has had in the past few years. Something to continue to monitor. 4. Their brand momentum may slow down which would slow down sales I\u2019m long $CROX \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Disclaimer: I\u2019m not a Financial Advisor, do your own due diligence.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-08-09 16:50:58", "id": "p11ujh"}

{"text": "Hey Guys :) In my opinion, Micron Technology is one of the best stocks among the whole semiconductor market with great fundamentals that has a high chance to go 60-100% up easily whenever its momentum starts up. When I posted my first MU DD 16 days ago, the opening price was $75.80 and closing price was $76.30. After my DD, it went up to $83.10, and then it dropped again to $75 until today because of bearish news about DRAM price forecasts. I sold my positions (100 shares at $78.50, and 27 Aug 75c x 10) at $82 on August 6th because I assured that $83.10 on August 4th was the peak before it drops again and the price upward movement was getting weakened since that date. Here is my first DD that shows the reasons why it has a great upside potential with great fundamentals and great growth guidance. Now, its price went down again to $73.30 in after-market which is discounted A LOT. $72-74 is the best entry point with the lowest risk and the greatest upside potentials since MU is a strong enough to rally and consolidate in the price range of 85-90 once it starts have some more good news, better earnings and growth guidance. I thought yesterday (August 10)'s drop was good enough to be the support line so I bought some 24 Sept 72 Calls since I expect to see $80-90 price range before its next earnings date (Sept 29). One trading tip for Micron is 'Never be too Greedy'. There are too many big hands who are playing their own game with this stock, and we need to sell the greed to make good profits from it before its massive sell offs come first. But then, why would I take a risk to play this intense game with these big hands? Because MU is too good and strong stock that makes its price keeps rallying and it will eventually keeps going up crazily when it starts to gain its momentum. We all know that we must buy GOOD stocks whenever its price drops more that its value. You always buy GOOD stocks when its is undervalued, and before it becomes more popular and becomes a meme stock later. And that is the time to sell when other people finally start to talk about MU and it becomes a MEME stock. Don't be like those kind of people who bought AMD at $115-120, but be like those kind of people who bought AMD at less than $78, or at least at less than $94. Yeah, so the whole point is \"Buying MU at $73.30 is a great choice I think\". Remember, 86.61% of MU stock is owned by institutions, which means that there will be always a huge sell offs whenever they think it is priced in because institutions need to sell faster than one another to make more profits before it tanks hard. But good thing is that those institutions keep buying it back at the support line which is $72-75 so it eventually rallies back; it means that it has a pretty high volatility, and we can use this high volatility to keep printing our profits if we know when to buy and when to sell without the greed and panicking. And I strongly believe that once it starts to get its momentum back, it has a high chance to break through its ATH $96 and go up to $150-180 in next year. \u200b Additional News after my first DD Bullish \\- Micron launched world's first 176-Layer NAND in mobile solutions to power lightning-fast 5G Experiences.

{"text": "I think after the last earnings call there is a lot of incorrect information or straight out distortion of facts being put out by people and analysts alike here and would like to set the record straight with what I believe the facts are. Production: The company in their earnings call said they are on track to start production at the end of Sep 2021. If you actually listened to what they said, they said this is for test-builds that they hope to validate in Q4 and to deliver a few to some special early customers in Q1' 2022. They further said or implied that they expect regular commercial deliveries to start in Q2' 2022. Previously, they said on the Q1' 2021 call they had enough cash to ramp production to produce and deliver 1,000 vehicles this year. Now delivery (ignoring their special test-builds delivered to early customers) is pushed back to Q2' 2022. Maybe the word PRODUCTION is being misused to imply something other than what they are doing. I would suggest the correct term for what they are doing now is PRE-PRODUCTION. In any case this is semantics as revenue requires deliveries, not production. Equity Line of Credit (ELOC): There have been claims that there is a \"Line of Credit\" providing up to $400M in financing in place. In fact this is a complete misrepresentation. Below is the link to an SEC filing describing the agreement between RIDE and YA. Here are some key points and how the $400M is computed and why it does not mean anything. On 7/23/2021 they entered into the agreement with YA to purchase up to $400M of their Class A Common Stock over a 36 month period at RIDE's discretion (that should be a red flag there. As why would YA agree to this... well all will be explained). Per that filing, \" The net proceeds that we may receive under the Purchase Agreement cannot be determined at this time...\", which means that while RIDE can potentially receive up to $400M, they might receive far less but can't predict that amount, as it depends on the stock price. The agreement says that RIDE can only sell YA, up to 35,144,690 in shares, UNLESS, (1) they obtain shareholder approval to sell more or (2) the average price they sell the shares to YA at is over $7.48 per share. The price of the shares is 3% less than the \"simple average of the daily VWAP's for the three trading days following notice to YA\" There are also daily limits on how many shares RIDE can sell to YA at any time. So assuming 35M shares, at a current share price of about $5.8 that is about $204M before the 3% discount to market price that RIDE nets. For RIDE to net 400M, with selling 35M shares they need a share price of $11.4. Alternatively they need shareholders to approve selling much more than 35M shares (so just more dilution) or they need the average price to be over $7.48, which will allow them to increase the shares they sell, so also more dilution. In sum, at current market prices they net about $200M under this \"Equity Line of Credit\" or share offering. However, as selling shares will likely depress the price, they should net far less. [ Further Dilution: Per the SEC filing below, it says that Mr. Burns can sell 50% of his shares by 10/23/2021. Steve Burns owns 46.4 million shares, so assuming he sells when his shares are unlocked he can sell 23.2M shares end of Oct 2021. While in theory not \"dilutive\" the end of lock-ups tend to have a similar impact by flooding the market with more shares than demand for them. [ Cash Position: Per their Q2 earnings call and reports they have about 366M in cash on hand at 6/30/2021. In their earnings report they suggested about 200M in operating expenses for the rest of 2021 and about 215M in CAPEX. While they suggested they can time some of the payments in Q3, this comes to about 415M in cash needed to get through the year. That is about 50M cash short. Going back to their ELOC, at current share price they can raise about 200M, so assuming they raise the funds without dropping the share price that leaves them with 150M at year end. It is reasonable to assume that their quarterly cash needs will only increase as they attempt to get to production (this has been the case so far for them and has been the case by every other auto maker as far as I can tell) means that for Q1' 2022 they will need over 200M. The conclusion is obvious, that on top of the current share offering, if the share price does not go up, they must issue more shares. Further, they project regular commercial deliveries in Q2' 2022 so the money they need will not be insignificant. Other Sources of Funds: The Company suggested that they are getting a valuation on their plant and equipment in order to possibly borrow funds against that. They suggested that the value is much more than the book value of about $300M. The fact is, a lot of their equipment will be installed and modified to their specs and will not be suitable without additional cost to another manufacturer. This means that fire sale value, or what someone might actually lend against it, will likely be far less than the book value. Perhaps to Lordstown, the value is higher, but to a third party that is a very doubtful assumption. As to the factory itself, it was an old plant that GM shut down. This is not something people are looking to buy. For EV's, you see with Tesla, Lucid, and others they are looking or building new factories with layouts designed for EV's and not ICE vehicles. I would again doubt the factory has much value for a lender. Hard to know what they can borrow using their plant and equipment as collateral, but it clearly will not be much. Conclusion: Given the dilution and share unlocks coming and their downward pressure on share price, as it stands now the company will have difficult raising sufficient funds to get to production. For the company to be viable, it must have its share price go up first to enable them to raise funds favorably. As evidenced by today's price action, this company is not attracting substantial shareholder inflows, so it remains unclear how the share price increases first to enable them to raise sufficient funds. So based on the current share price, I don't understand how this company, even if they do everything right going forward, can succeed. Some Other Thoughts: None of the above analysis is dependent on whether the in-wheel tech works or not or is a good candidate for a commercially viable electric truck. I have for several months expressed substantial doubts about the tech and RIDE's ability to execute and have no reason to assume otherwise. In any case, even if it could work, structurally RIDE is not in a position anymore to commercialize it. I actually also have an issue with Price Targets analysts are setting here. Either you have to have a high price target or a near-zero one. An in-between target makes no sense as current share price means they are headed to insolvency before they can produce anything. This company is either a $10+ investment or a <$1 investment, there is no in-between. TL,DR price-target <$1 and bankruptcy in Q4' 2021 or Q1' 2022 (if they are lucky they push it off till Q2' 2022).

{"text": "This post will do a forward looking trade plan for MRNA after the recent big swings and also show how this relates to generic models and other big (Interesting) price moves we've seen recently. \u200b To understand this analysis it's best to read through previous posts; Previous posts 1]( \u200b Here was the original forecast; \u200b One of the things I've found most useful that I've covered in my posts is the tendency for markets to reverse off parabolic moves into a 161 level. >Now I know most of you don't give a fuck about 161s, but that's probably because you don't know about the fucking weird sketchy shit that happens around 161s. Why I think a SPX high soon is possible. : wallstreetbets (reddit.com)]( \u200b We're matching various conditions we'd need for the model. Phase 6 is a parabolic move, the rush of euphoria. Phase 7 is the dump when price rejects from the 161 level. Phase 7 is the bull trap and using this model you'd have been filling pending orders on the 161 retest (Market went a tiny bit higher and then dumped hard). \u200b And using this model this was the forecast generated. Looks a lot alike. I could \"Claim\" that, this isn't actually what I was trying to show in the OP. I think it's reasonably unlikely the high has been made and the crash has started on this, assuming there's to be a crash. But I actually meant to show a deeper drop (Bear trap) before the high, which I assumed would happen from 440 and not 500. I think we're actually in a dummy crash. The start of the trappy section of the trend. Where there's a big drop to trap bears and then a parabolic rally to trap bulls - and then there's a real crash. Typically this is a news loaded part of the move. Prices move fast and volatile and usually there's headlines flying around to explain these. If we are in the dummy crash, it should stop by around 38% retracement. And then start to aggressively uptrend. Going parabolic 20% after breaking the high. Then settling into a longer and slower top - a top usually takes a long time to form. We could still be a considerable amount of time away from the top in this. We may only be in this section of a top (This is a template of common stages I see in tops I use generically, it's not fitted to this move). \u200b Looking at the small timeframe price action on the break in MRNA it matches quite a lot of the common parts of this topping pattern (I can \"Claim\" this one. These were moves I was talking about when I made this template. Market breaks off highs). \u200b So all of these are flagging up heavy bearish signals, but where things go devastatingly wrong for bears is when they confuse this move with the start of a big crash and it turns out in a big timeframe perspective we're actually here. And that this is going to start to trend back upwards aggressively through the big down day candles and then spike these out by approximately 20 - 25% before making a real top. When we have sharp pullbacks we can draw 161's off them and if this is to be the last bear trap before the real crash typically we're going to see the crash starting somewhere between the 161 and 220 fibs. Over the 220 fib level price is telling you this is not working. This is not a \"Right eventually\" strategy - small zones are defined in which the probability are more favourable. Here would be our forecast with that. Interestingly the 161 rule matches the \"Above 20%\" rule. And with these two independent factors agreeing we'd also still have to see price going parabolic into that level to give us a confirmed short setup. So as price is heading into the 575 - 600 zone we'd have a very well planned trade. Very defined shorting plan. Bear porn \u200b Here's where it gets fucky - and this is the only reason I care about telling people, tbh. \u200b Here's the trade we've just seen in MRNA in the SPX. Instability section of 2018 and 2019 into the strong breakout. Hits a 161. Price changes direction. There was news. I know that's a fact - but this was also exactly on the 161. That's also a fact. There's only one way to draw this swing. Only one high, only one low. Hit the 161 of it. \u200b The market would drop about 30% ... This is the \"Known\" typical ratio of the last bear trap. When that happened, it would have been possible to do the same thing we've just done with MRNA. If we think a crash can come, we can make a plan that if it gets into a new high, and then it goes parabolic during that new high, with it going parabolic to about 20 - 25% above the high, then we can short it - only if this is also a 161 extension. And this gives signals here. Using this model is not flagging up a lot of random signals to short things because \"The stock's not worth this much\" - that should work, but it fucking doesn't. Circled in blue are places where using this you're likely to pick up short signals in real time (Some would lose). And in red is all the places people associate shorting with when they think it always loses. We're not trading those areas. With that in mind, a combination of the things covered in '( and '( there is a strong case built up for shorting as it headed into 4,000 and while it is in the 4,000 - 4,750 sort of range. If it breaks over the 220 fib, this would be reason to exit bear trades. It will be right soon, or it won't be. It's not an \"Eventually strategy\". If SPX was to be following this model, the next big swing's rules would be; Drops approximately 50% - 60% This spikes out low of big bear trap \u200b Two rules, both have to match. Which they would if price was to fall from the 161. \u200b I want to reiterate, there is usually new news that comes along with big price moves, but to have done all the things required to flag up this area as the area in which you'd be most interested in shorting could all be done during 2020. Like we can with MRNA today. \u200b \u200b Updates when MRNA moves a bit. If it crashes it's really fucking up my example. \u200b Model implies; Long MRNA while under 390. Stop loss 330. Look for strong trending properties. There will be sharp dips, these are good buys. Plan to short into 575 - 650 sort of zone, if price action is parabolic into here. Expect the news into the high to be positive for the asset, it usually is. Often pop comes on bad news.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-08-12 01:48:55", "id": "p2o5kp"}

{"text": "I\u2019m trying my hand at writing \u201cDD\u201d, and I figured you \u201cgeniuses\u201d would be the perfect test audience. Alright, so now let me explain to you why I still have a thing for the homebuilding sector \u2013 and more specifically: Green Brick Partners (GRBK). That\u2019s right, these guys are so confident in their business that they named their company GREEN BRICK! They\u2019re feeling themselves and so are the Market Analysts tracking them and their sector. TL;DR In case you don\u2019t have time to read all of this or look at any of the pictures I included for you, then here\u2019s the long and short of it: the housing market likely won\u2019t letup anytime soon and builders will continue to keep churning out record profits for quarters to come. The safest play is to stay away from calls and look at shares. If you think shares are stupid and are only for boomers, then I suggest looking at ITM calls with a delta \u2265.70 for any OPEX after August 2021. Or, in true WSB fashion, go for those near expiry OTM calls like a moth to a flame and see what happens. Either way, whatever you choose to do (or don\u2019t, because that\u2019s just as cool) please don\u2019t interpret what I\u2019ve researched and posted here as financial advice. ToC: i. Overview & CEO ii. Target Market iii. Land Lots & Supply iv. Operating System v. Financials vi. Growth Focus vii. Competition viii. Bear Case ix. Technical Analysis x. Strategy xi. Conclusion & Disclaimer i. Overview GRBK is a homebuilder and land development company that deals in primarily single-family homes. GRBK does this by working with their subsidiary and affiliate homebuilders in Texas, Colorado, Georgia, and Florida. GRBK subsidiary and affiliate homebuilders are either wholly owned by GRBK or have a majority stake of their business owned by GRBK; GRBK has a pathway to 100% ownership for all subsidiary and affiliate business where they maintain a majority stake in today. Moreover, GRBK has ownership stake in two mortgage lending businesses and one property title business. GRBK\u2019s CEO and co-founder, Jim Brickman (henceforth referred to as \u201cBig Jim\u201d), plays an important part to my investing thesis and why I\u2019m so bullish on his business. Since I don\u2019t prefer to invest my money in companies ran by chud CEOs - \u00e0 la Jimmy Chill - I\u2019m happy to report that Big Jim isn\u2019t even close to being a chud. GRBK isn\u2019t Big Jim\u2019s first foray into running a homebuilder business. No, in fact Big Jim was part owner of a different Texas homebuilder during the \u201880s. During this period of Big Jim\u2019s career is where he got to experience the joys and pains of leverage. Yes, that same kind of leverage you brain surgeons use when buying deep OTM options on meme stocks with your margin accounts funded by student loans, credit cards, personal loans, etc. As you can imagine Big Jim might\u2019ve also believed things literally couldn\u2019t go tits up. Enter the 1984 \u2013 1990 Texas housing depression which caused things to go tits up. Now, to be fair, things went bad for everyone and not just Big Jim during this period in the Texas housing market. I\u2019m not going to go into the details of how Big Jim managed to come through this with his head still attached, but he did. The key takeaway from all this is Big Jim has experience playing with leverage and getting burned in the process. GRBK as a result of this is one of the lower levered homebuilders in the market. This is also why GRBK resolves to operate their business by keeping their debt-to-capital ratios at no more than 35%. Despite Big Jim\u2019s insistence to grow without the aid of obscene leverage, the business is producing record financial results each year. ii. Target Market GRBK has successfully diversified their business portfolio to target buyers at all stages of the homeownership cycle. These could be buyers looking for townhomes, luxury homes, and everything in between. GRBK does this by aligning a specific brand to their target market based on price, geography, and type of home. Here\u2019s a snapshot from their recent Q2 2021 investor day presentation deck that outlines this well: GRBK reported in their Q2 2021 8-K filing that their average home sale price is approximately $438K/unit averaged across all brands. Per their direction advised on their recent earnings call and investor day presentations, GRBK has spent Q1 & Q2 of 2021 focused on their entry-level, detached single family product \u2013 Trophy Signature Homes (referred to henceforth as \u201cTrophy\u201d). GRBK has identified that Trophy represents a significant position in how they will look to achieve these tremendous growth figures for years to come, as well as CB JENI, their townhome brand product. I won\u2019t get into too many of the specifics surrounding the various geographies that GRBK\u2019s brands are based in, but I will narrow into the Dallas Forth Worth (DFW) market. DFW is where Trophy and CB JENI developments are primarily located. As you might be aware, DFW is one of the most active real estate markets in the country. Although Big Jim wouldn\u2019t provide many details surrounding their expansion plans for the Trophy & CB JENI brands outside of the DFW area, he did comment that they are actively looking at the Denver market for these brands to supplement their existing Denver brand product, Challenger Homes. I\u2019ve lost too much money with you rocket scientists on surefire investments - such as one ticker that deals in cow shit - I\u2019ll be foregoing the expensive market survey reports from some of the fancy real estate consulting shops and instead will use what is free and accessible \u2013 Zonda. The grid below gives a breakout of what Zonda is reporting for a given Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) of where they\u2019re seeing the highest number of housing build starts reported in 2Q 2021. This is great for GRBK since their two biggest growth brands are already established in DFW, which is seeing a 29.9% increase! \u200b iii. Land Lots & Supply Now, here\u2019s where some of you folks with a wrinkle or two might be thinking to yourself, \u201chey, housing build starts are great metrics and all, but what happens if they run out of primo land to build on?\u201d. If this was you, congratulations because we\u2019re going to talk about land lots soon and why they are ridiculously important \u2013 not just for GRBK, but for all homebuilders. Which now leads me to my next exhibit, which is not a graph at all but a tweet from Zonda\u2019s Chief Economist, Ali Wolf (henceforth referred to as \u201cThe Wolf\u201d), who has exemplified great understanding of millennial homebuyers; this is in addition to her already well documented knowledge and experience of residential housing economics (seriously, go check out her credentials). Here\u2019 what The Wolf has recently said concerning the importance of land lots and their subsequent availability: \u200b The Wolf goes on to share the following graph with us from Zonda\u2019s New Home Land Supply Index (LSI) study. LSI aims to show how specific MSAs are trending regarding available single family vacant lot availability. LSI outputs are adjusted to provide greater weight of figures to vacant lots in MSA subdivisions showing higher building activity. LSI outputs an easy-to-digest scale of measurements based on the following score strata: \u00b7 125 \u2013 Significantly Oversupplied \u00b7 115 \u2013 125 \u2013 Slightly Oversupplied \u00b7 85 \u2013 115 \u2013 Appropriately Supplied \u00b7 75 \u2013 85 \u2013 Slightly Undersupplied \u00b7 < 75 \u2013 Significantly Undersupplied \u200b Now, just focusing in on Dallas since this is where GRBK has stated is their primary development geography, we can see a reported LSI value of 48.2. Based on the above strata, this means that the Dallas MSA is significantly undersupplied. Here\u2019s why, for me at least, this plays into my bull case for GRBK. GRBK has spent the better part of the last 16 months building up their lot position. Based on GRBK\u2019s recently reported numbers, they\u2019re stating they have either ownership or control of approximately 21,000 lots in their entire book. Their current lot catalog represents a 133% increase over the last 12 months, which is huge. Increase in lot size is a strong indicator for future financial growth. Although GRBK doesn\u2019t report out how many of those lots are secured for DFW, we can safely assume that a good bulk of these numbers are allocated for this MSA due to how much of a focus market it is for their growth strategy. GRBK is in a great spot with their lot supply and we can now look to their projections of lot pipeline delivery for the next 6 \u2013 18 months. GRBK plans to be able to deliver to their builders an estimated 1,800 lots within the next 6 months. Moreover, they are projecting they will be able to deliver an estimated 4,600 lots to their builders in 2022. Next to buyer demand, developed land lots are the single most important thing for builders. GRBK\u2019s superior lot size and strict underwriting model is what they see most attributable to their growth results and will continue to play a role in their future growth. I already mentioned that GRBK has a unique internal control system on their debt-to-capital ratios that they don\u2019t allow to exceed 35%; they\u2019re currently below this threshold although not by much. Additionally, GRBK has a strict underwriting model that they adhere to which targets meeting a 20% un-levered return and exceeding 20% gross margins on transactions. GRBK\u2019s operating model also aims for them to maintain these numbers without having to rely solely on passing the expense onto customers. This is a great segue into GRBK\u2019s Operating System. iv. Operating System It\u2019s not uncommon for large homebuilders to have multiple different affiliate builder and subsidiaries that operate underneath them and GRBK is no different. Out of all of the subsidiary and affiliate builders that GRBK either wholly owns or maintains a majority ownership stake, they all utilize GRBK\u2019s Operating System (OS). GRBK\u2019s OS is focused on the following: 1. Accounting 2. Construction 3. Purchasing 4. Production Platform So, what does this all mean? This OS is how GRBK handles and runs their entire business in an efficient and scalable way. GRBK\u2019s builders are provided with an IT platform that allows them to easily track and manage their production pipelines from end-to-end. This in turn allows GRBK to collect and analyze real-time business analytics to identify any worrying gaps or trends within the various segments of their business. For those unfamiliar with Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses (SG&A), it\u2019s an important metric for any business. SG&A though becomes more important for businesses that deal in actual physical goods when compared to other businesses. The reason for this is that margin can be more easily affected by external forces. Companies that lower their SG&A can generally expect to see a positive impact to their profit margins as a result. GRBK\u2019s OS allows them to monitor their business channels tightly and efficiently to ensure that they are truly reducing SG&A wherever possible. GRBK has successfully reduced their SG&A YoY and is currently reporting an SG&A of 9.1%, or $45K/unit. GRBK projects that they will be able to continue reducing their SG&A and therefore add additional room for higher profit margins per unit. GRBK has a solid OS which provides me with added confidence that they are managing all ends of their business responsibly and effectively. Additionally, it tells me that should GRBK look to acquire future builders into their portfolio this OS should help them integrate M&A targets more easily and quickly. Lastly, I like their OS because it allows them to actively track and monitor their internal debt-to-capital ratios by providing access to real-time business financial performance. v. Financials We\u2019ll cover some of the financial performance figures of GRBK in this section. Fair warning, there may be some things in these financial statements that you\u2019re unfamiliar with, such as an astounding lack of parentheses around numbers, and that\u2019s okay \u2013 we\u2019re going to talk about it. GRBK has a profitable business and a balance sheet to support this. Let\u2019s look at their recent Q2 2021 filing: \u200b To me, this statement is nothing but beautiful. Out of the many great figures reported, their revenue and Earnings Per Share (EPS) are what jump out at me. When comparing this quarter\u2019s results to Q2 of 2020, you can see that they increased their total reported revenues by more than 62%. Additionally, they saw their EPS grow by more than 53% when compared to the same period. Outstanding all around and absolutely above board what The Street projected. In terms of where these revenues are being derived from, GRBK reports that they maintain four prominent revenue streams for their business (in no particular order): homebuilding, mortgage, title, and residential management service operation. I believe it\u2019s safe to assume based on their financial statement that homebuilding represents their single largest revenue channel of their entire business. In the next section we\u2019ll touch on how they\u2019re poised to continue this growth by focusing their efforts on their Trophy & CB JENI product brands. In summary, nothing personally jumps out to me as being bad or worrisome about their financial statement. I will say both here and in the bear case section, that this level of growth is enormous and should certainly be viewed as a positive but could also prove to trap GRBK to meeting continuously loftier financial results YoY. One thing I will note is that later in their 8-K filing it is shown that GRBK has 100MM shares authorized of their common stock versus a float of roughly half that at 50.7MM. vi. Growth Focus GRBK has stated that they\u2019re looking to possibly expand into other MSAs but have not publicly identified which MSAs they\u2019re currently eyeing except for Denver. It\u2019s important to note that GRBK already has a presence in Denver with their Challenger Homes brand; I speculate this statement to mean that they will consider moving other brand offerings into this MSA with a focus on entry level home buyers via their Trophy & CB JENI brands. GRBK reported that their average unit home sale price was approximately $438K in Q2 2021. Trophy & CB JENI are already established brands in DFW. As noted earlier, we know that GRBK increased their lot size by over 133% in the past 12 months. Taking into consideration their strong lot size position and Zonda\u2019s reporting that the DFW MSA is significantly undersupplied for available developed lots is key when contrasting the reported number of new home build starts for this same MSA. My interpretation of this is that GRBK expects to see tremendous, continued growth for the balance of 2021 and into 2022 based on how they have appropriated their lot sizing and development pipeline. I find additional confidence in my thesis knowing that a large portion of GRBK\u2019s lot positions will be allocated to support the Trophy & CB JENI brands that cater to the entry level buyer group with an average purchase price below GRBK\u2019s reported $438K average unit sale price. Looking back to GRBK\u2019s investor day presentation, it was reported that their Trophy brand of homes represented their largest portion of sales YTD. This is great news especially when considering that Trophy is one of GRBK\u2019s highest margin brands. Let\u2019s look at the following exhibit which supports this position: \u200b Per the above, you can see that the majority of GRBK\u2019s lot position is indeed allocated to support the Trophy brand in the DFW area. Moreover, when comparing their YTD units started being lower than their other brands but showing a higher allocation of total lots controlled for the same period makes me believe that they\u2019re truly focusing in on driving growth at the entry level buyer segment and have big plans for the remainder of 2021. Unfortunately, GRBK didn\u2019t provide as much information regarding their plans for the CB JENI brand outside of comments made by GRBK\u2019s leadership team, and the President of CB JENI, that they would indeed be focusing on this brand as well. Lastly, look at the financial growth results produced by Trophy: \u200b The key takeaway here is how GRBK has managed to so efficiently manage their Trophy brands product to secure such incredible results on its financial growth. Lowered SG&A will lead to higher margins and GRBK has already stated that their OS is how they hope to continue improving upon lowering their SG&A. Another interesting thing to comment on about Trophy is how GRBK has led with some market innovation by using pre-manufactured roofing trusses and pre-built wall panels. These strategies have allowed the Trophy brands to better control construction materials costs and decrease their skilled labor needs. Lastly, they\u2019re able to increase their build cycle timelines by having these pre-manufactured and pre-built materials included as part of their home construction. Overall, I think GRBK has a great strategy in place for their Trophy & CB JENI brands and will ultimately continue to see popularity amongst entry level homebuyers. One thing I will note is that we cannot turn a blind eye to the global supply chain disruptions that are plaguing the market end-to-end and as a result of GRBK using pre-manufactured and pre-built construction materials in their homes could open them to susceptible project overages if they must pivot to more conventional methods during the construction process; this would most likely create a negative impact to their brand SG&A and profit margins. vii. Competition Make no mistake, there is plenty of competition in this sector. When comparing GRBK to their competition you will find that they\u2019re generally a smaller player in this sector in terms of market cap. For comparison, Lennar (LEN) maintains a market cap of \\~$33.5BN vs. GRBK\u2019s market cap of $1.35BN. However, of all the competitors there really are only two that have a similar market cap, float, and P/E to GRBK. Those competitors are Tri Point Homes (TPH) and Taylor Morrison (TMHC). Other tickers for this sector include: KBH, NVR, MHO, CCS, MDC, DHI, PHM, and LGIH. I have not spent nearly as much time researching GRBK\u2019s competitors, however a review of their overall performance seems to show that the sector in general is doing very well. I think there are some other sympathetic trading plays here to be made that apply to GRBK\u2019s competition, too. If you\u2019re interested in GRBK I think it would be worth the time to investigate some of these other tickers for investment consideration, too. Lastly, I\u2019ll comment that you should look at XHB, which is the S&P homebuilder ETF. viii. Bear Case The primary concern that I have for not just GRBK alone, but this sector, is maintain buyer demand. Without buyer demand high there is little opportunity for GRBK to continue posting these record profits. Personally, I got interested in this space after having gone through the process of trying to buy a home myself and subsequently being priced out of where I hoped to buy. My response to this was to simply to just \u201cwait and see\u201d how the market responds. I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m beginning to think my decision was a mistake based on what I\u2019ve researched. Another consideration to make is existing unit backlogs. GRBK reported a backlog of 1,876 at an average unit price of $519K for Q2 2021. By GRBK\u2019s own admission, they are closely monitoring their backlog inventories but are not yet concerned of driving down these supply figures. There are two concerns here I recognize: if buyer demand drops off the backlog and spec home units will pile up and create a negative impact to GRBK\u2019s bottom life and capital efficiencies. I will be closely watching GRBK\u2019s backlog numbers reported for Q3 2021. Mortgage rates right now are at historic lows but are starting to creep up ever so slightly. Low interest rates can offset some of the financial cost associated with purchasing a more expensive home \u2013 you\u2019re robbing Peter (mortgage company) with a lower interest rate, to pay Paul (GRBK, other builders) for their higher priced products. The concern here is that if cost does not equally level out when interest rates eventually increase, then you can no longer expect to be able to rob Peter to pay Paul, which would effectively price more people out of the market. Again, it\u2019s going to be critical to see what happens with the Trophy & CB JENI brand lines of GRBK since they\u2019ll be focusing on the cheaper entry level buyer space. Lot availability is a concern. I\u2019ve already pointed out how The Wolf has stated that homebuilder success is directly attributable to their lot positions. If GRBK is not able to continue to manage their lot pipeline to pace accordingly with their building timelines and schedules for the upcoming years, then they will face problems with meeting their high growth projections. Watching the overall progression of available lots for the MSAs that GRBK operates in, and their subsequent lot acquisition pricing will be huge to gauge whether they can keep up this performance. I\u2019m sure there are other bear cases to be made, however this is what I\u2019ve come up with now. Please feel free to add and comment with your own takes and considerations. Overall, I feel as though the bull cases still outweigh the bear cases to be made for this ticker. iv. Technical Analysis For those of you who place a considerable amount of weight to TA, then you can thank u/FoxTechnicals for reviewing this. I\u2019m going to do my best to interpret what I see, however I\u2019ll let u/FoxTechnicals chime in with any additional comments or observations they would like to make in the form of edits and updates to the post. We\u2019ll start looking at the following: \u200b This chart is looking to show us that GRBK may be on its way towards a breakout from the 2X.XX something share price it\u2019s been trading at for so long. I\u2019d also comment here that following their recent Q2 2021 earnings that most Analysts are maintaining price targets that range from the low to mid 30s; one such example is B. Riley raised their original PT of $35/share to $37/share on 8/05/21. This also shows that the lower trend could target somewhere in the 24s. Also, it\u2019s important to note the comparison to XHB and that GRBK\u2019s RSI is improving against XHB. Earlier I mentioned LEN as a competitor to GRBK, so let\u2019s look at LEN: \u200b Looking at this chart, u/FoxTechnicals is showing that LEN also appears to be on a breakout trend upwards. Now, admittedly I\u2019m not as familiar with LEN\u2019s business as I am with GRBK but based on what little review I\u2019ve done they also seem to be doing extremely well as far as financial results are concerned. I\u2019ll let u/FoxTechnicals provide any additional commentary on this ticker that they\u2019ve identified. Next, we\u2019ll look at XHB: \u200b Looking back to the initial chart of GRBK, and then comparing it to XHB, you\u2019ll recall that GRBK\u2019s RSI was increasing against homebuilders (XHB). Well, when you look at this chart and compare XHB against SPY you can see there are higher highs being made against SPY. This action could signal that we\u2019re looking at a potential breakout for leading the market x. Strategy As mentioned in the initial, TL;DR, I think the primary play here is with shares. However, there is a way to play this with options as well, but we need to be clear on the risks as such. Fortunately, this section should be brief in contrast to the rest of this submission, but there really isn\u2019t much strategy surrounding what I think is best or \u201csafest\u201d with respect to this stock and that\u2019s holding shares. Truly, just buy shares and hold and I think you will see a great return especially around their Q3 2021 earnings call. Now, about options there is a way to play this if you\u2019re okay with the risk. Couple of things you need to know is that overall GRBK doesn\u2019t have much volume in their average daily shares traded. Currently their three-month average daily volume is only 433K shares/day against a float of approximately 50.77MM shares. Additionally, you must recognize that GRBK\u2019s options are extremely illiquid. The bid/ask spreads are tremendously wide, and you will run the risk of getting hammered on bad fills (or plainly just not getting filled at all). That\u2019s not a lot of daily movement and as a result the IV for their option chain is low \u2013 only currently showing \\~48%. So, if you\u2019re interested, you could look at picking up OTM calls for September & November expiries to try and possibly benefit from increased performance in this sector over the coming weeks/months and make your gains from any increases in IV accordingly. Personally, I do not think this is a good idea and is well outside of my risk profile but I\u2019m sure for some of you this is right what you\u2019re looking for. Now, the safer options play would be to target ITM options with a delta value of \u2265.70 for expiries beginning in September at the earliest. If you can afford these calls, you would be able to (more or less) establish for yourself a synthetic long position without needing to hold shares. The caveat to this is that you\u2019re going to benefit less from things such as IV expansion as the delta values of your calls become closer to a value of 1.0. The strategy here is to ride the calls for as long as you probably would if you were instead holding shares. Again, I still think shares are the better play, but you do what\u2019s best for you. xi. Conclusion & Disclaimer I am not a financial advisor. I have made tremendously questionable investment decisions during my short time spent here on WSB. As a result, please do your own research. Please review what I\u2019ve written and check into it for yourself. Essentially do not blindly take my word for anything and instead do a bit of legwork and figure out if you think you see the value in this ticker (hell, or even sector) like I do. These statements and writings are nothing more than my opinion and should not be interpreted as professional and legitimate financial or investment advice. That now being out the way, I do believe in GRBK\u2019s growth strategy and overall business model. I think that GRBK is an affordable, value play in this sector that will only look to see increased coverage in months to come. I also think that GRBK is uniquely positioned above their competition to be successful in how they manage their affiliate and subsidiary builders. Also, I\u2019m quite pleased to see how GRBK was head of the curve in their decision to accumulate immense lot ownership to fuel their continued growth objectives. Lastly, GRBK\u2019s CEO and co-founder, Big Jim, has a great approach to manage debt-to-capital in a way that has successfully proven that you don\u2019t need to lever yourself to the tits to secure great profit results. Currently I only maintain active positions in GRBK. My positions are solely in call options. Let me explain why that is. I\u2019ve currently been holding 2x 8/20 25c since this past April to speculate on this stock before entering a long position. My intent was to see the share price rise to \\~$27 sometime in June and then at that point make the decision to either cut away and STC my calls or exercise. I never hit my PT and therefore will most likely look to roll my calls to November OPEX or flat out exercise next Friday. I also picked up some lottery tickets this week when the rally began on Monday at 3x $30 strike \u2013 these calls are not doing great as you can imagine for all the reasons I mentioned above. Lastly, I have a single call for September OPEX at the $30 strike. Here is a snapshot of my positions: \u200b", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-08-12 22:33:11", "id": "p371r9"}

{"text": "Maybe a lot of people use strategies that don't really care about how leveraged their options are, but I personally always like to know. When you walk through them and see that one is x6 leverage (\ud83d\ude80) and one is x35 (\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80) it opens your eyes and makes you think a bit more carefully about what you're doing so you don't accidentally do something too safe. I like to follow the philosophy that if you can't teach something you don't understand it well enough so I made this into a video that explains this entirely using PowerPoint icons, which is linked at the bottom. I'm going to explain everything here though because I know clicking a link is a lot of work. When I did this math Visa was trading at $243.17 per share. Visa might not be a classic around here but look at that 5 year graph, you literally can't lose. You can buy a call (\ud83d\ude80) with a strike price of 240 that expires September 17th for $853. This call has a delta of about 0.59. I'm assuming the people here at least know that delta exists and where to find it. This means that this option currently moves up and down with the \u201cpower\u201d of 59 shares. If this option moves deeper in the money this number will increase. If this option moves out of the money this number will decrease. Knowing that this option moves as if it were 59 shares is the key to finding its leverage (\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80). 59 shares at Visa\u2019s current price would cost $14,347 but you only need to pay $853 for this contract, what a deal, which has the same ability to make or lose money. So with $14,347 you could buy 16 of these contracts (\ud83d\ude80) which means this contract has about 16 times leverage (\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80). You can calculate this exactly by dividing $14,347 by 853 to get the amount of leverage at that moment, which is 16.82. So, every dollar you put into these Visa calls is going to gain or lose almost 17 times more than if you just bought shares. A 2 year call on AAPL could be as conservative as 2x leverage and a daily UPRO call could have 100x (\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80). Know what you're getting yourself into before you throw your money into something like x2 leverage. For the big brains out there, this is a minor greek called lambda. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 TLDR: Option Leverage = (Delta Share Price) / Option Price \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 Example: Visa 240c 9/17 = (59 243.17) / 853 = 16.82 Video version:", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-08-11 16:36:52", "id": "p2d7o7"}

{"text": "Disclaimer : This article was written to supplement my Options Trading Exit Strategies video. Those looking for more in depth explanations and examples should refer to the video, which can be found on my profile. Happy Trading! What\u2019s poppin\u2019 bull-gang, Flux here with an options exit strategy \u201cguide\u201d. I wanted to make this writeup because more often than not, I see people making fundamentally sound trades, only to have their gains vanish due to having poor exit strategy. They either get too greedy and hold on for way too long, or they exit way too early and miss out on an insane runup and want to die for a couple of days afterwards. There\u2019s two parts to each trade - an entry and an exit - and if you\u2019re caught skimping on either end, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. Although this part of trading isn\u2019t glamourous, it\u2019s absolutely vital to your overall success as a trader, so it\u2019s crucial that you learn and study these concepts sooner rather than later. With all that being said, let\u2019s get into it. --- #Types of Exits There\u2019s three types of exits that I tend to use when I conduct my trades, each useful in their own right. I\u2019ll give a quick summary of them all, before providing an in depth analysis and examples of each. - Fundamental Exits pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding the change of a company\u2019s fundamentals. These exits usually take place before the fundamental changes since you\u2019re not going to be able to react to the changes in real time and you\u2019ll end up getting front run by algos. Examples of this include taking an exit during an earnings runup or rundown, taking exits before company related news events, or taking an exit before any market-wide news events. - Technical Exits pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. Once I see a pattern or indicator pass a certain threshold, I know it\u2019s likely time to exit my position. Some examples of technical exits may include exits taken around support and resistance levels, exits taken during gap fills, exits taken based off of technical patterns, and exits taken during the absence of any concrete patterns or indicators. - Psychologic Exits pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding market psychology. This is the simplest of the three categories, and is often used in tandem with the other strategies to provide yourself with the best exit possible. Some strategies include exiting around whole numbers, screenshot theory, and individual gain theory. More on these later. Obviously there are going to be a handful of strategies and categories which I\u2019ve missed, but the ones I outlined above are likely going to be the ones which are most common to us retail traders. --- #Fundamental Exits Fundamental exits revolve around one key idea - Sell the news. More often than not, the results of a given news event are already baked into a stock's price well before the news event is confirmed or actually takes place. As a result, the price of a stock will almost always DROP even if this news is \u201cconfirmed\u201d, because it was already priced in. This can be observed anywhere from earnings runups to product launches to fundamental news events. You may be wondering why this drop even happens in the first place - if the news is baked into a stock's price, shouldn\u2019t it stay flat when the news is confirmed? Hint : Trading Algorithms. Algorithms, or algos for short, are always behind the inevitable tanking of a stock's price post news event. It\u2019s quite easy to see why once you understand how these algorithms work. An algo can read through an entire earnings report / news transcript / whatever and fire off a corresponding trade in a fraction of a nanosecond, meaning that they\u2019re at a huge advantage since they have the ability to sell the news after the news event hits. This means that algos don\u2019t have to prematurely exit their position until they confirm that the underlying security was priced properly. If the underlying was priced to perfection, the algo takes its profits once the news confirms it (very common behavior among algos - take profits once there are no longer any catalysts in play), thereby causing the stock to tank. If the instrument wasn\u2019t priced properly, and there is a huge upside beat, the algo just stays in the trade and reaps the rewards, exiting at a later date instead. This concept is pretty difficult to wrap your head around initially, so let's go through an example. In our hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL has just reported earnings. Scenario 1 : $AAPL is priced properly. The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and confirms that $AAPL was indeed priced properly. The algo then takes its profits (as per common algo behavior), and dumps the position as a result of the priced in ER. Many other algos do the same as well, and the stock price \u201ctanks\u201d, resulting in a gap down the following day, and many left holding the bag, even on a seemingly good ER. Welcome to \u201cpriced in\u201d. Scenario 2 : $AAPL is NOT priced properly. The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and concludes that $AAPL was NOT priced properly. There was a huge upside beat. Instead of selling, the algo stays in the position because it knows that the underlying is undervalued based on the new news, and rides the wave up, exiting the position at a later date. $AAPL was not priced properly, and as a result, the news wasn\u2019t priced in. In both cases, the algos win - they either escape with their profits, or ride the wave up for even more gains. Us humans cannot act as quickly as an algo, and thus we\u2019ll always be at a disadvantage when it comes to fundamental exits. We always have to exit our positions prior to news catalysts to avoid getting front run. News events are almost ALWAYS priced in. We can\u2019t sell the news AFTER the news drops because we cant digest and react to the news fast enough. We can\u2019t front run the algorithms, so we need to sell BEFORE any fundamental news catalysts, otherwise we run the risk of holding the bag. If there\u2019s one thing I want you all to take away from this article, it's that you should always sell the news. --- # Exiting Around Earnings This is a very simple concept once we understand the mechanisms outlined above. If you\u2019re in a trade, always look to close it out before earnings (unless you wanna get rug pulled, in which case go ahead, I'm not your daddy). If the news is priced in (which it probably is), you\u2019ll get front run by algos and they\u2019ll steal your profits. Do not gamble on the \u201cpriced-in\u201c news being wrong. You\u2019ll lose that bet 9/10 times. Please note that even if earnings is a beat, that \u201cbeat\u201d can still be priced in. Please, exit your trades before earnings, or you run the risk of getting blown out due to your own ignorance. # Exiting Around Product Launches This is similar to the concept we outlined above. In this hypothetical example, let\u2019s say $AAPL announces that they\u2019re going to reveal a new line of products in August. If that\u2019s the case, get ready to exit your position before the event. Every August $AAPL showcases their new iPhones for the year, therefore even though they haven\u2019t explicitly said they\u2019re going to reveal iPhones, the market is gonna price the event as if iPhones are going to be revealed. Once they reveal that their new products are in fact iPhones, the price will tank, because it was priced in, and algos followed the exact behavior outlined earlier. The only instance in which the price wouldn\u2019t tank would be if they announced that they\u2019re releasing a teleportation device or something. Believe it or not, the odds of that happening are astronomically low, so you\u2019re better off just selling before the reveal instead. Unless $AAPL comes out with something totally unexpected, the price will drop. # Exiting Around Fundamental News Events This pertains to market moving news as a whole, like an FOMC speech or some macroeconomic event. If you know that JPow is gonna speak on Wednesday, it\u2019s probably best to exit your position before that since you\u2019ve honestly got no idea what\u2019s gonna happen as a byproduct of it. The entire market could take a shit or could fly green, nobody knows. Since we\u2019re traders, not gamblers, it\u2019s in our best interest to exit our positions or hedge in order to shield our gains. Fundamental news events are often crapshoots, and are the leading cause of solid gains getting unjustly erased in an instant. --- #Technical Exits Technical exits pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. In order to have the ability to do a technical exit, you must have a basic understanding of technical charts, patterns, and indicators. The entire field of technical analysis is easy to understand, but hard to master, so even if you don\u2019t have much experience in the area, I\u2019ll do my best to explain it all in a way which is friendly towards newer traders. --- #Exiting Around Support and Resistance This is often one of the easiest exits to perform, as it\u2019s fairly straightforward to identify on a chart. Whenever you start to approach an area which you\u2019ve deemed as a key level of support or resistance, consider exiting your trade. If the price has bounced off of that particular level five times in the past, it\u2019ll likely hold true for the 6th time unless something has fundamentally changed about the company or the markets. As a result, you know that you should exit your trade as you approach the level, as it likely won\u2019t keep going in the same direction once we get to that point. An awesome example of this would be the $CLF chart., and as a result, are prone to getting \u201cfilled\u201d very quickly. Once we are within the price range of a gap, it\u2019s very common that we will get sucked through the area with prices strongly trending towards the opposite side of the gap as a byproduct of the lack of volume. When trading gaps, we need to recognize two important levels, and understand how price will act around them. The very last trade that took place before the gap was created will be a very heavy level of resistance, and the very first trade that takes place after a gap will also be a very heavy level of resistance. As a result, we will be very prone to rejecting off of these levels, so we want to fully exit our trade around these levels, no exceptions. Once we\u2019re past the initial resistance, we can look to re-enter the trade to capture the rest of our profits. Understanding all of that, gap trades are relatively simple. First, we ride our trade up to our first level of resistance (the beginning of the gap, aka the price that the first trade was conducted at), and then take our exit to lock in our profits. Afterwards, we set an alert slightly above the resistance, so we get notified once we\u2019re past the resistance and are in the gap. Since we know there\u2019s no trading volume within the gap, there\u2019s a good chance we will get sucked through to the other side, meaning we should look to re-enter the trade as quickly as possible and then ride it to the opposite end of the gap (the end of the gap aka the price that the last trade was conducted at before the gap was created). Once we get to the opposite end of the gap, we fully exit the trade, because we know that 99% of the time we will reject off of this next heavy level of resistance. Gaps have a very rigid structure, and trade very similar to a breakout play. Enter a trade, exit at first resistance. Re-enter the trade after we break resistance, exit once we\u2019re at the second resistance. If this concept was unclear or confusing, refer to the video because you were put in a position where you had to \u201ctrade\u201d money which you also needed elsewhere. If you\u2019re ever in a situation where you\u2019re forced to trade to make some extra dough, take those profits asap. A loss is often going to make your life a hell of a lot worse than a win will. # Exiting Around Whole Numbers Humans are weird creatures - we like \u201cwhole\u201d or \u201cround\u201d stuff, numbers being no exception. How often do you catch yourself submitting a buy order for 20$, or a sell order for $50. Unless you\u2019re cognizant of it, you\u2019re not going to think to yourself \u201cimma buy $CLF at 21.83\u201d. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re gonna round it up to $22, or down to $20, etc. The same goes for literally EVERYONE else. Just keep in mind that depending on the direction you\u2019re trading, there\u2019s often going to be buyers / sellers at whole numbers. $10, $20, $25, $30, etc. No number is safe. Look to time your exits before or after these numbers, as they may prove to be mini points of resistance. You\u2019ll often see sellers step in at whole numbers on the way up, and buyers step in at whole numbers on the way down. Use this to your advantage. --- # Emotional Exits This concept applies to two key emotions - Euphoria and Hope. The instant you start feeling euphoric about a trade and it\u2019s potential gains, step away from the trade. You\u2019re not going to be thinking clearly enough to make an optimal trade or exit. There\u2019s a very high chance you\u2019re going to continue to chase the victory. If the victory starts slipping away from you, you're likely going to stay in the trade hoping that it goes back up to the previous high that you didn\u2019t sell at. In situations like this, by staying in the trade, you\u2019ll almost always hold your position well past the top, and will be prone to \u201cdiamond hands-ing\u201d your profits into the ground, ultimately coming up with a loss on a fundamentally sound trade. You need to be conscious of the fact that you\u2019re euphoric, and that this trade went awesome, and exit the position intelligently. Once you start feeling euphoria, and consequently hope, there\u2019s no going back. You\u2019re not trading on fundamentals, and you\u2019re not trading on technicals either. You\u2019re simply not trading rationally. In situations like this, it\u2019s best to take a step back and exit the trade before you make a boneheaded move and end up giving your gains away. Emotions cloud judgement, and as traders, that\u2019s the last thing we want. Sell out of a position once you start feeling intense emotion. --- #Conclusion All in all, options trading is a difficult game with many moving parts - If you're caught skimping on your exits, you\u2019re gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. This aspect of trading is less glamorous and often overlooked, but is absolutely vital to your success as a trader. I hope this writeup was informative and useful to you all!

Revenue -They will give a new higher guidance or will say they expect to deliver on the top end of the current guidance. - Their 2021 guidance is $440-480M and in Q1 they already made $112M. - Based on public data they already did in Q2 about $115-125M only from igaming. - When you add sports betting, mainly from PA and IL (the rest is to small) you get another $18-25M. - this takes them to $123M to $150M for q2. This his half of what DKNG did this Q. - with NFL coming, new state launches, organic growth and with IL keeping in person sign-up (will protect their IL market share), they will easily do another $270-300M in h2. This is just the US but they also have other international revenues. This will take them to $500M-550M for the year, big increase from their initial guidance. 2. Partnership - There are some rumours they will get a new state with a lottery and that will drive their growth further 3. Product - they had a big upgrade on their Sportsbook apps 4. Risks - they are very likely to lose the market access to NY, they will say they are taking part in the RFA but I think they will not be able to compete with the big guys. 5. Other opportunities - There is a high likelyhood that someone will make a bid for them as they have market access across the US, good product (some of it in house) and healthy revenue. - I have a buyer in mind but I can\u2019t share the info.

Which is still a possibility but I'm starting to lean towards sometime in September based on the fact that today is August 9th and the pr said by the end of September.

Bezos Expeditions, the VC arm of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, also invested, along with Perceptive Advisors, Andreessen Horowitz, Madrona Venture Group, and others.\" from [this article. The price target seems to have been set at $13.00 for Nautilus Biotechnology.\" Earnings are expected on August 10th. So What Is It? From the cnbc article: \"Nautilus has built a prototype for a device that can measure the human proteome, a set of proteins in the body that, unlike the genome, is constantly changing based on food consumption and other factors. Companies such as Thermo Fisher Scientific produce mass spectrometers, but those devices can be expensive and and only yield a small percentage of proteins from a drop of blood, Sujal Patel, co-founder and CEO of Nautilus, said in an interview. The company wants to become capable of measuring more than 95% of the proteome. Organizations could use the system for drug discovery, as well as clinical diagnostics and precision medicine. In 2020 Roche-owned Genentech agreed to use Nautilus' system, and the companies plan to publish their research findings. Nautilus expects its first revenue in 2022 and is targeting a long-term operating margin of 25% to 30%. Patel, formerly co-founder CEO of data-storage hardware company Isilon, which EMC acquired in 2010 for $2.3 billion, said Nautilus will sell its instruments along and provide cloud-based software.\" The article continues with some of its uses. Personally, I've been tracking this company since last year, and was excited to finally be able to invest in them. I've lost about $1,000 in expired options, there's very little volume on average. I was hoping for a jump once they went public but oh well. I sold all my shares today for a profit at $11.50 (phew, those bags were getting heavy lol), then bought another hundred about an hour later at $8.75. I'll begin accumulating again. This is definitely a long term speculative play, but I think this is exactly the kind of \"disruptor tech\" that growth investors get excited for, and with their first earnings report next week on 8/10, the shares are looking pretty inexpensive at the moment.

{"text": "\u200b Here\u2019s Why: 1. Members growth 110% YOY (now at 2.3M). SOFI rolled out a ton of credit card promotions and new account bonuses. If just 10% of wsb users sign up for the free money alone, that\u2019s a 43% increase in their membership base, which would blow their quarterly metrics and analyst expectations out of the water. 2. App store Top #4 app: SoFi app was #122 May, #102 in June, #5 yesterday, and now #4. 3. Their Galileo platform services 70 million accounts (130% YOY growth) and is used by many major Fintech companies (Samsung, MoneyLion, Monzo, SoFi, Vala, Wise etc). Galileo is used by RobinHood and nearly all their transactions are processed through it. 4. So, if RobinHood does well, then SOFI should do equally well. HOOD is valued at 45 Billion, while SOFI is way undervalued at 13 Billion. With higher annual revenue and growth, SOFI should be near 25 Billion in my opinion; once people learn more about the company. 5. A friend of a friend who knows a friend that works at the company who\u2019s also my friend, says they are actively working on options trading platform. 6. Bank charter status: this is jet fuel to SOFI\u2019s business allowing them to out compete and out tech anyone. Expected by end of year or early next. Just a matter of time. 7. Cathie Wood will likely add SOFI to ARKK or ARKF in the near future. We know how much she loves SQ. SOFI should fit her funds perfectly; both high tech and high growth. SoftBank is already a major investor in SOFI. 8. Stock took a beating past couple months due to lock up expiration. By now, those who wanted to sell already sold. Only way is up.

{"text": "I have never had the stones to buy options, but maybe now is the time? Other than the ridiculous spike at the beginning of 2021, Baidu has traded down over 5 years. The 1 year is skewed, but if we look back at day for day, it was about $120 against current day $150. So if I had bought and held through the spike I would have still been up a very decent 25% in 1yr. Now, Baidu has a P/E of about 7. Compare to Baba at about 23, Tencent about 21.5, JD is at 14. Stateside, mega giants Google is at 30 and Amazon is running a 57 P/E. Financials: assets have climbed steadily every year. They\u2019re cash positive with money in the bank.

The big audacious goal he is their AI. They are the leader in China here, and I believe this will allow them some explosive growth in the future as autonomous driving becomes a reality, online search becomes increasingly driven by AI, and cloud business. This should allow it to rise above the competition from Bytedance, Tencent, Alibaba, and others for search revenue. The obvious elephant in the room is the Chinese government crackdown on\u2026 everything. Short term, makes this very volatile.

So why would you buy this low beta snooze fest? High Dividends, good value, rising revenue, and more. So first we start with basic reasons why you should buy into the health sector, demand literally never goes away. You could take out a mortgage to buy a play on oil futures, but you'd be at the mercy of some fat Saudi Arabian man halfway across the world, but with health, it's a market that has constant and steady demand with no catalysts that can diminish it in any significant way. You might also consider it because of the potential of the delta variant, and how health stocks may be one of the few sectors resistant to it. Now onto the company itself, if you've seen pharmaceutical ads in any capacity you are probably familiar with Eliquis, it has a current ratio of 1.54, a quick ratio of 1.21, and an outstanding covered ratio of 6.13. \ud83d\udcf7 R&D is an important metric to consider when buying pharma stocks and BMY is in the the top 10 of spenders when it comes to percentage of revenue allocated. In order to perpetuate growth, companies need to consistently pump cash into research new drugs, which obviously comes with risk of failure. This puts BMY in a category of pharma stocks that are financially stable enough to warrant a buy on that merit, while also having robust spending in their R&D department to facilitate growth. This spending continues to grow, this being demonstrated by the near 40% increase in R&D spending within the last year by BMY. Forecasts predict the company will grow by around 7% a year for the next 3-4 years and forward EPS growth expected to reach close to 20%. >\"Bristol Myers' Opdivo -- a cancer medicine -- and anticoagulant Eliquis (the rights of which Bristol Myers shares with Pfizer) will both be among the top five best-selling drugs in the world by 2026, according to the research company Evaluate Pharma\" Source compared to the industry average of 24.01 (23.47 FWD). Already with head start, BMY has an EV/EBIDTA of 9.75 (7.48 FWD) compared to the industry average 20.29 (16.36 FWD). I could go on, but you get the main idea that in all value metrics BMY is beating the industry (and market). With the recent acquisition of Celgene undoubtedly adding more value, it's undeniably undervalued. Upside for BMY is crazy, to bring it to the industry average P/E ratio would bring the price per share to around $179 at current EPS estimates ($7.49), an over 250% increase. While this may be wildly optimistic, even an increase to a P/E ratio of 15 would bring the price to around $112. TLDR: Bristol Myers:Squibb is a great, financially stable pharma company with good growth opportunity, tons of value, and dividend growth. The overall consensus from analysts is buy for a reason. BMY is a great way to hedge your portfolio from any volatility in the market (Beta of 0.59) while still getting more gains than any other comparable hedge.

It\u2019s a ticker you have seen before: LUMN If this is already too much words, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be brief \u2013 and before you close this post because there are no rocket emojis, this is a play that might not have the moonshot potential you live for, but will yield annual bananas for years to come. So, on to the stock, and more words for you to not read. Lumen Technologies First off \u2013 what does this company do? I typically like to google companies first, before investing. They have a website, so that checks out. I think they sell phones or something. Their website talks about edge computing. That\u2019s future stuff. Either way \u2013 they make money selling their current telecommunications services, and a lot of it. Net Income of $506 million this quarter (even with decline in sales). Earnings per share $0.46 for the quarter. Some more rambling about EBITDA and free cash flow, that I don\u2019t understand. But here is the \u00bd punch: Board approved an up to $1 billion Stock Repurchase Program over two years $1 billion in dividend payouts For a company with a market cap just under $13 billion, that\u2019s like a 16% locked in return. (Can someone double check that? Just an ape, am bad at math) Seriously \u2013 after the 8% decline yesterday post-earnings, it seems like a pretty good price/entry-point for a company that is committed to returning value to their stockholders, is selling chunks of their business to raise capital for forays into more modern technology services. They could turn things around \u2013 unlike the vast majority of tech startups and hopefuls, they already make fucking money. TLDR If I wasn\u2019t brief enough, my assertion is this: the market overreacted (it\u2019s a model of efficiency) to their Q2 earnings report/declining sales, and this solid dividend earner is on sale. Value plays aren\u2019t your style, and I know you\u2019re retarded, but you will still need a way to eat if when your out-of-the-money GME calls expire worthless. No lambos here, but it will afford you the means to purchase bananas with the dividends for the rest of your life (or at least until all the people with landline phones die, whichever comes first).

I expect the Feds will reimburse agencies and or communities who apply for these funds at over 80% (2), all the funds will surely be used. So, the infrastructure will be built for a reason, to power up electric vehicles, and in this case, electric buses. Who makes them, who are the top electric bus producers? (3) AB Volvo (Sweden) BYD (China) Proterra (America) VDL Groep (Netherlands) Yutong (China) The Department of Transportation and The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) mandate that one can only use federal funds to buy buses if they contain more than 70% of its parts manufactured in the USA (4) Simply put, FTA \"you want $1 million to buy that bus?\" You \"Yes\" FTA \"Well, the bus has to be comprised of more than 70% American parts, or I don't give you the money, capiche? You \"ok\" Proterra is the only large electric bus manufacturer in America. (5) This gives them a very clear advantage with regard to meeting the Buy America requirements, and therefore winning the bid, and earning the sell. # Today is their earnings announcement, after hours. What is expected? I'm long, so I hope their revenue has increased substantially. That being said, it is possible that Covid related supply chain issues etc, will decrease this. One example of this occurring took place in Idaho who placed an order for 12 Proterra buses in January 2020, and expected the buses to be delivered by late 2020 (6). Most of the buses were delayed, however, and now most will not be delivered until late 2021 (7.) In the bus world, you don't get paid, until you deliver. I could see their revenue numbers being down from expected perhaps. So the key thing to focus on is their current confirmed orders and especially those that will be delivered sooner (by end of 2021). This will provide a deeper understanding of their financial position. Today, if they miss their revenue, I expect them to meet or exceed their deliverables and confirmed orders. I also think that going forward, especially in Q3 and Q1 2022, you will start seeing Proterra's revenue moving up on a consistent basis as they make up for covid losses with production. The risk-reward is much more asymmetric now that PTRA is trading much lower than a few months ago. I also think that PTRA is suffering from a SPAC stigma, and that will soon go away as the revenue begins to increase. LUCID is still up 140% on the year (market cap $39 billion) and is barely built any cars. PTRA has sold 600, and each of these costs approximately $1 million, its market cap is $2.43 billion. Not apples to apples, but you get my point. \u200b # TLDR I am long PTRA. I think it has reached a fair price to start a position. I think it will go up in price in the medium to long term even if it misses its revenue in the short term. Many delays can be attributed to Covid, and revenue should return, as they start delivering buses. It's will be buoyed by federal funds that will be released after the House signs the infrastructure bill, sometime in late September-October. This will boost EV infrastructure, which makes it easier to operate electric buses. It enjoys a significant advantage by being located in America, as it is much easier for agencies who procure their buses to use federal funds and meet the federal Buy America clause. I see opportuny here, risk is much lower than a few months ago, and the future could be very bright for Proterra. \u200b \u200b \u200b Source 1. [ 2. [ 3. [ 4. [ 5.

{"text": "Disclaimer: Only my opinions, not a financial advisor, not a recommendation to buy, all information is accurate to the best of my limited knowledge. Overview of business: At its core, Poshmark is a platform that connects sellers of clothing with buyers. The founder, Manish Chandra often touts the \"social commerce\" element and continues to talk about social commerce as this is where he believes the moat of the business is. I wish he would stop, Poshmark isn't about social commerce, the true moat is empowerment. My experience with Poshmark: During the Pandemic, I grew interested in vintage clothing and began buying stuff on resale platforms and reselling it to an audience I've built on Instagram. I sell on instagram because most of the things I sell are $200+ and I find my margins to be around 40% so if I were to make $100 gross profit on a $200 sale and net $80 after shipping and other expenses, selling on a platform like Poshmark wouldn't makes sense as the fee to do so would be 20% of sale price: $40 on a $200 sale, AKA half my net profit. My resale activity is extremely niche and not a scaleable business. What I have found in doing it is that I need to source my inventory and I have bought items on Poshmark, Depop, Mercari, Ebay, Etsy, Grailed, and Facebook Marketplace. Ebay takes the cake, I find the most stuff on there and whenever I have tried to sell I move stuff quickest on Ebay. Poshmark is a close second. Over the winter I found the supply of stuff I could buy cheap on Poshmark and flip on Instagram outstanding. For the longest time, I couldn't understand why all these people would sell things on Poshmark as the percentage of each sale they take is the highest compared to their online marketplace competitors. Poshmark takes 20% of every sale above $15 and a flat $2.95 for sales below $15. Ebay takes around 10-15% (they have recently cut PayPal out of the payment processing and are now charging more and I know a lot of sellers are not happy). Etsy also has a long and complicated breakdown of what they charge, but its less than 20%, Grailed & Depop take 10%, and Facebook marketplace takes 5%. So why would anyone in their right mind sell something on Poshmark and pay a 20% fee when they could sell it on Facebook Marketplace and pay a 5% fee? Isn't this whole industry about to compete in a race to the bottom where one platform with resources (like Facebook) can undercut the others and then another platform does the same until there is no profit left in the industry? When I heard Poshmark was going to IPO I was thinking about buying puts or avoiding the stock altogether as my answer to these questions was people will move from where the fees are highest to where they are lowest. Because of this straightforward incentive, platforms will undercut each other until there is no profit and eventually there will be consolidation. When conducting some light DD on this thesis I spoke to a number of Poshmark sellers and did some digging, I changed my mind and went long shares at $75, then again at $68, then again at $62, then again at $57, then again at $56, then again at $47. Now, I am holding a massive bag of shit. When the stock crashed after Q1 earnings I was feeling very discouraged and although I was not considering selling, the 40% loss on my position stung. But, after seeing the stock crater another 8% yesterday on news they are planning to expand into India, I felt that maybe I should take a look at call prices. Before we get into options plays, I want to try and articulate what caused me to feel bullish about the stock. Poshmark's Competitive Advantage Poshmark's CEO, Manish Chandra, touts social commerce and \"posh parties\" similar to Tupperware parties as one of their key differentiators. I get a notification on my phone everyday that one of these parties is going on but I haven't been able to figure out what its about. I see Poshmark's competitive advantages differently. Three come to mind. The first is how easy it is to list an item on Poshmark. Take a photo, check a few boxes, name a price, and post. Compared to Ebay which is incredibly labor intensive and involves so many categories and sub-categories, Poshmark streamlines the process through having an efficient and easy to use UI. The second competitive advantage is how easy it is for Poshmark sellers to ship items. Buyers pay for shipping and it is a flat rate of $7.45. When an item is sold on poshmark the buyer has to pay instantly (ebay does not have this feature and as a result sellers say 10%+ of items sold have buyers that do not pay and they have to go through the process of canceling and re-listing). When the item is sold Poshmark E-mails a shipping label to you, all you have to do is print it out and tape it on ANY box or packaging and either drop it at USPS or have them pick it up. It is incredibly easy. Both of these attributes remove the barriers to entry that new sellers face. When you get started you want it to be easy and straightforward. Incredibly, Ebay and other platforms have fee structures that are difficult to understand, platforms that are difficult to use, and most require a PayPal to be set up as well. The third competitive advantage is by far the most important and hardest to create and sustain. Poshmark has a fiercely loyal and passionate user base of sellers who swear by the platform. Some become \"Poshmark ambassadors. Because it's easy to use sellers tell other sellers and buyers become sellers. We live in a market economy and with the rise of social media, large internet companies, and superstar founder entrepreneurs, the lives of entrepreneurs and the value they bring to society has been glorified. I think most people want to participate in the market economy, they want to be an entrepreneur, be their own boss, or have a \"side hustle\". Unfortunately, it's not easy and the few that succeed stand on a pile of failed ventures and crushed dreams. Poshmark makes it easy. Poshmark enables people who have been excluded from the wealth generating aspects of the online internet economy into successful participants. Broadly, those who haven't benefited from this new globalized economy have been: Women, racial minorities, geographic minorities (south, midwest). The demographics of Poshmark sellers and users closely align with those who have been excluded. The vast majority of Poshmark sellers are women, I was unable to find an exact number but in Poshmark's 2020 social commerce report by making it easy for them to feel successful and have a side hustle. Empowerment is an incredible feeling for those who haven't felt it before and Poshmark makes it possible for millions to feel this way. Why Wall Street Misunderstands Poshmark In order to find an investment that can provide outsized returns, it's important to have an information advantage over the consensus view. Wall Street does not understand this stock because broadly speaking Wall Street is an information laggard when it comes to valuing companies that provide products and services primarily to women. I've made similar investments in Lululemon and Revolve that have preformed extremely well as the consensus changed. As investors have seen this pattern play out over and over Wall Street investors have started to \"ask their wife\" or \"pay attention to their daughter\" in looking for innovative companies. The problem with Poshmark's stock is that the types of people who work on Wall Street analyzing stocks and their wives don't use poshmark, and neither do their daughters. When I was looking into the management at Poshmark I noticed Serena Williams is a board member. I am an avid tennis fan and as such I have a favorite player: Roger Federer. Everyone loves Federer, he is a class act and attracts sponsorships from the likes of Rolex, Mercedes, Netjets, Rimowa, Swiss coffee machine makers, and has an ownership stake in On Running. These are brands Wall Streeters love! Serena Williams has a different public perception. On court she in an incredible competitor with a lot of passion which sometimes translates into dramatic meltdowns and aggressive behavior towards umpires. I am not looking at this trade as a short squeeze but if shorts do decide to cover the stock could begin to run and run fast. The Trade Shares are the safest play. There are limited options available on Poshmark with spreads I could drive a truck through. The furthest out are Feb 18, 2022. $65 is the highest strike available. Because of the spreads, uncertainty of when an upside move will occur, and lack of long dated options, I only own shares. Second Quarter earnings are coming up on 8/10 with guidance of $79.0 million - $81.0 million in Revenue and $1.5 million - $2.5 million in Adjusted EBITDA. I am fairly confidant they will beat the guidance they set for themselves but unsure if this will result in a massive move to the upside. I think it could take more time. I have a fairly high conviction in this trade and am posting to get feedback and thoughts from others, that said Poshmark is only 10%+ of my portfolio and I want to crowdsource my ideas a bit more before I buy options or decide to sell other investments to buy more. TLDR Poshmark empowers women. This is their competitive advantage. Wall Street doesn't get this.O", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-08-03 21:31:43", "id": "ox9pcc"}

{"text": "Space is a fairly new industry in terms of traditional stock market exposure/risk, but in most situations it\u2019s often the newer fields and technologies that have the best asymmetrical upside for investors. Now I\u2019ve always been a fan of space and the development of aerospace technologies for my entire life, but I\u2019ve also been an investor (aka degenerate gambler). Astra and Rocket Lab are both companies that produce rockets that are/have gone public via SPAC this year. Rocket Lab will complete its merger on August 20th after an investor vote but when it does it\u2019s likely to behave the same way astra did. When Astra merged with its SPAC the price pumped hard from $10-$11 up over $15 before crashing down to $8 currently. This is basically pure hype and the fact that investors want good exposure to the space industry. Rocket Lab is a massively undervalued company that is known as the best small satellite launch provider in the world. It uses high strength carbon fiber to build reusable rockets which can fire into very direct and specific orbits better then traditional larger providers like SpaceX. But it\u2019s biggest value comes in the fact that they are using their position as the current best and most used small sat launcher to develop medium lift rockets capable of competing directly with the SpaceX Falcon 9. They also have developed the first modular and modifiable commercial spacecraft. Within the next two years Rocket Lab will be sending a private scientific mission to Venus to show off the capability of the worlds first commercially available and modifiable Photon spacecraft (essentially a bulky satellite for interplanetary travel) that it expects to sell to governments and universities etc around the world. Think also about the companies interested in asteroid mining which could use these too. Astra on the other hand has a specific but great niche. They are run by former NASA people and are dedicated to the idea of simplification and scaling. They are very far along with their development of a rocket small enough to fit into a shipping container but simple enough to be mass produced. They want to be the Cessna to spaceX\u2019s 737. It\u2019s a good idea. There are plans to have an American lunar base within a decade and the Russians and Chinese have the same goal and timeline. There is a lot of support and commercial opportunities that can come from the establishment of bases like these. See, we are at the beginning of a space race, China sent a rover with the specific design and intention of finding the best place to put a manned Martian base, as well as their deployment of a Chinese space station. This stuff is getting real spicy and the market has not factored in the tremendous growth that comes with the sheer number of people who can benefit from accessing space whether it\u2019s for colonization, mining, exploration, scientific endeavors/experimentation, or most importantly manufacturing. (When you don\u2019t worry about gravity gravity doesn\u2019t squash the thing you\u2019re 3D printing before you print the rest of the support structure). The upside is insane and it\u2019s being overlooked because space is seen as risky and crowded and people are wary of SPACs. These two specific companies, especially Rocket Lab, fill a fantastic niche not filled by anyone else. The drive and scientific intent of their founders/CEOs are the type of exploration oriented drive that will actually propel innovation instead of just sitting and doing the bare minimum like Blue Origin, ULA, or some of the other larger standard launch providers do. Those companies are about to be disrupted on a massive scale. Rocket Lab is trading at about $10 as Vector Acquisition but post merger we could expect a massive spike in valuation as the more wary investors pile in after the SPAC risk is over. The options are cheap as hell on both companies too. Because Astra is basically the only other new small launch provider that\u2019s public it makes sense that an increased valuation and bullish run on the price of Rocket Lab will correspond with the same investors diversifying risk into Astra as well (which is seen by investors as an equivalent small sat launcher), causing a pump. Considering the merger vote meeting is planned for the 20th of this month, I\u2019m surprised that IV isn\u2019t higher for Rocket Lab or Astra, but it\u2019s beginning to trend upwards as more investors decide to sink some change into the company. It\u2019s surprising to me how little coverage this stock has gotten. It\u2019s going to be a massive story when it blows up this month, but for now everyone seems to be silent. They have the technical understanding, the track record, multiple government contracts already, and the prospect of a space race all going for them, that\u2019s some deep value if I\u2019ve ever seen it. I realized this opportunity not from researching the stock but from the company itself, I love space and I am a fan of following the rapid development of the industry. A whole lot of people are starting to plan businesses around space and investing big bucks, and they all need a rocket to get them there. The fact that Rocket Lab is setting itself up with the Neutron medium lift rocket to directly compete with SpaceX is alone a massive indicator of future value. SpaceX is valued over $70 billion and the current valuation of Rocket Lab is just $4 billion. That\u2019s a lot of room for growth. $SPCE is a good play but it is a space tourism company and they still value it at $10 billion, these companies have such a broader and consistent consumer base as compared to something as risky and unfounded as space tourism, which indicates the massive undervaluation situation we have in RKLB and ASTR. Disclaimer: I own a bunch of options that expire on 9/17 in both companies as well as more then 50 shares of each in underlying stock. TL:DR; because of global politics and reduced costs of rockets, Rocket Lab ($RKLB) and Astra ($ASTR) are set up to become massive mid to large cap businesses tho they trade at absurdly low valuations today.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-08-03 20:22:37", "id": "ox8861"}
{"text": "Background In May, Discovery announced a deal to merge with AT&T\u2019s Warner Media business \u2013 their goal is to create a streaming powerhouse to compete with Disney and Netflix. The new business will be called \u2018Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019 and the deal is expected to close mid 2022. Both businesses saw growth in streaming subscriptions this quarter. Warner Media has 67.5m subs (growth of 6% Q-o-Q) and Discovery has 17m subs (growth of 30% Q-o-Q). That\u2019s a total of 85m subs, with quarterly growth of 8%. I think the combined entity will see further subscription growth, as the value proposition of the combined entity will be far more compelling. I don\u2019t need to tell you how the market will reward such growth (just look at the valuations of Netflix and Disney) The Smoothbrain Play Warner Bros. Discovery is forecasting FY23 EBITDA of $14b and Free Cash Flow of $8.4b. Discovery stockholders will receive 29% of the combined entity. Discovery\u2019s stock (DISCK) closed at $26.50 last night, giving Discovery a market cap of $13b (there are 3 classes of Discovery stock, but they all rank equal in the merger, so I\u2019m doing my maths on the cheapest class which is DISCK). At a $13b valuation for Discovery (which is 29% of the merged entity), \u2018Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019 therefore has a market cap of only $45b. At a market cap of $45b, you\u2019re buying in at a multiple of only 3.2x for FY23 EBITDA and 5.3x for FY23 Free Cash Flow, which is an absolute bargain. In comparison, Netflix trades on a 13x EBITDA multiple. If \u2018Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019 were to also trade at a 13x EBITDA multiple, then a DISCK stock would be worth $106 The play therefore is to buy into Warner Bros. Discovery via DISCK while the multiples are ridiculously low.

{"text": "Alright idiots, listen up because I\u2019m only going to say this once and hopefully you guys listen. The company I\u2019m going to be talking about today is AVIR. What is AVIR? Well it\u2019s a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing oral therapies. It IPO\u2019d recently and has a market cap of currently as I write this 2.75 billion. I know what you\u2019re thinking, \u201cyeah yeah yeah another explosive biopharma that will pump and dump\u201d. Well unlike your traditional clinical stage bio company, these guys have a ridiculous backing from some of the biggest names in the biopharma space. Fidelity- just raised their stake by 60% quarterly into AVIR to about $335 million. Cormorant- holds a $200 million + stake. Bain Capital- $175 million RA Capital- $167 million Perceptive- $96 million Not to mention Goldman Sachs also holds about a $60 million dollar stake. Seems small but when the companies market cap is under 3 billion, all of these stakes add up. I believe institutional ownership is at around 60% which is abnormal in this space. So what\u2019s there to be excited about? In particular one drug. That drug is called AT-527. If you look at the chart of AVIR you\u2019ll notice it spiked from roughly 24$ - $94.17 in the span of a month. This is all because of this beautiful little drug. AT-527 is an oral, direct activist antiviral drug candidate which is being evaluated for COVID-19. It is currently in Phase 3 and the results from Phase 2 were astounding. It was well tolerated in 35 COVID-19 patients and in 28 HCV-infected patients. The results were so good in fact they secured a partnership with ROCHE (one of the biggest bio tech companies out there) and continue working together to bring this drug to market. Now as we\u2019ve seen, COVID is not going away. The delta variant is spreading rapidly and now CNBC is already touting headlines that supply chain issues are starting again. The fear mongering has started and it\u2019s only going to get worse as 40% of the population refuses to get vaccinated. The sentiment has started to change and the market is looking for a cure, I believe AVIR is well equipped to deliver. AVIR is the closest company out there to having a drug in pill form ready to distribute for the population. CASH AND RUNWAY So AVIR is in a fantastic situation financially right now. They currently have around $800 million + in cash and are sitting at around $250 million + in debt. They came out and said this will give them enough runway to pursue all their programs through 2023. In biotech it\u2019s common for companies to dilute their stock in order to raise cash and this OFTEN times kills momentum. One of the most frustrating things to see as an investor. AVIR also has 2 other programs moving forward (AT-752) Fighting against Dengue Fever and (AT-787) which fights against Hepatitis C. The stock has been beaten down from its 52 week high of 94$ to roughly $18 on seemingly no news\u2026 absurd I know but the rally has started back up. The MACD has curled and we are already at 33$ give or take a few cents. I think moving forward this could easily be a 10 billion dollar company if all goes according to plan. The upwards momentum right now has no plans of slowing down. The RSI is an a pretty healthy spot on the 1 month and 6 month. I believe a short term PT of 55$ is not unreasonable and the sky is the limit for long term potential. Keep in mind that the distribution of their drug will be much easier too. They are already well equipped to deliver it around the world and it is CONSIDERABLY more feasible to distribute a pill form substance rather than one that needs to be injected. We are expecting Phase 3 news which could be an amazing catalyst in the 2h of 2021. Not to mention we are also expecting a Phase 1 result of AT-752 for Dengue Fever in 2h of 2021 as well. This DD isn\u2019t the most complex but I promise you take a look for yourself and you will not be disappointed.

{"text": "BioNTech was $208 on July 13 and is $350 today, 15 trading days later. Its RSI is approaching 90. Moderna went from $235 to $365. I understand they delivered wonders for humanity with effective COVID vaccines, but the magnitude of the surge is highly unusual. 1) Delta - The variant is not exactly news at this point. The world has already gone through 3 major waves. This wave isn\u2019t expected to be as bad as last winter\u2019s, when BioN stock actually fell from $130 to $85 between early Dec 2020 & early Jan 2021. 2) Earnings - Since Pfizer reported earnings last week, BioN has run up another 25% since then. (They split vaccine revenues 50-50.) A large earnings beat should be more than priced in already. 3) Total Addressable Market 3a) Government deals - BioN & Moderna raised their vaccine prices in the latest EU contract. But this has been known for some time. The US government might push back against similar price increases. 3b) Booster shots - CDC has said booster shots are likely NOT needed for fully-vaccinated, otherwise healthy adults. Without recurring revenue, they would appear to be priced too richly (Moderna >20 forward P/E) for a largely one-time, even if multi-year, windfall. There will also be political pushback against hoarding boosters for wealthy countries if most of the developing world hasn\u2019t yet received their initial doses. 3c) Future products - No doubt both companies gained brand value from their covid vaccine, but future products are still years down the road. 4) Short interest - neither stock has unusually high short interest (<1% BioN, <4% Moderna) so it doesn\u2019t appear to be a squeeze.

{"text": "Listen up retards, this won't be short. This was not meant for you apes; Seek ing alpha denied my article because they don't want recent SPACs merger on their website. So instead of earning cash to spend it on stupid shit, I'm here wasting my time for you all because I don't want 50 hours and 4000 words of research to go to waste, let me tell you gamblers why Microvast ($MVST) is a Hidden gem. First of all, you retards probably came for the short squeeze potential, rumor has it, there's not many shares left to short sell and Microvast is down 60% from its peak (even after yesterday's 20%+ run), but I could not care less about that, MVST will trade significantly higher once decent analysts start coverage on it and this post will tell you why. You guys are so lucky to have found this now, I've been holding since November when it was $11, so the price right now is still dirt cheap (it was $15 two weeks ago...). Quick introduction for those of you who don\u2019t know what Microvast is and what it does. Microvast is a technology innovator for Li-ion batteries that designs, develops and manufactures battery systems for commercial electric vehicles and energy storage that feature ultra-fast charging capabilities, long life and superior safety. Microvast believes the ultra-fast charging capabilities of its battery systems make charging electric vehicles as convenient as fueling conventional vehicles and believes the long battery life of its battery systems reduces the total cost of ownership of electric vehicles. Microvast is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 87%, their estimates are justified by the growing desire for electrification as well as the growing demand for clean energy and the zero-carbon revolution. The forecasted battery components revenues (see picture below) come from Microvast being vertically integrated. Their battery components are world-class, significantly differentiating and they are going to sell those parts to some key cell manufacturers in the passenger EV market (specifically their aramid separator and their gradient cathode). They currently ship to passenger vehicle applications (SAIC) but are also engaging with passenger OEMs that have made the announcement that they will manufacture their own batteries (with battery components)\\. They also plan to do the same thing with consumer electronics. \u200b Microvast's projected revenues While their projections may seem optimistic, they were able to secure partnerships with industry leaders representing over $1.5 Bn in contracted revenue through 2027. $44 millions, $125 millions, $172 millions, $250 millions, and $355 millions for 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025 respectively. Those numbers were before they recently announced a partnership with eVersum, a high-tech vehicle OEM, specialized in the design, development, and build of the most purposely engineered electric commercial vehicles for passenger transport. The deal has a potential volume forecasted to be more than 100 million \u20ac. There\u2019s a great interview on cheddar news. That differentiates them from most of the other battery makers who source their components from the vendors. It is important to note the cell makers do not have the right to produce the material that they did not invent or have the license for. \u201cMicrovast invented and manufactures the key battery materials to ensure unique performance and by also guaranteeing the leading time because the material patents are the strongest patents, legally protected and our success is founded on our deep technology portfolio which is wholly owned and protected by over 550 patents (and patent applications)\u201d, said Dr. Mattis, Chief Technology Officer of the company. \\- They have more than 1800 employees including more than 500 employees in the R&D division. \\- They have 28000+ Battery systems in operation in 19 different countries. \\- More than 3.8Bn Miles of operational distance was covered with no major safety incidents. \\- Their Batteries can run at a high temperature for a long time and they won\u2019t explode. They have this proprietary way for their Batteries to be 90% as efficient as brand-new ones after 10,000 charges. \\- Among all of Microvast\u2019s products, two stands out that no one else in the world has: the 100% Aramid separator and the full concentration of the grading of the material. o \u201cOne of the perks for the solid-state battery is on shrinking separators and with our Aramid separator, we are there\u201d, Dr Wenjuan Mattis said in the Wedbush conference held on April 8th2021. For the fans of solid-state batteries, this could be a major catalyst incoming. Their Aramid separator has higher thermal stability than charged cathode material; 2X the temperature resistance of traditional poly-ethylene separators, enhancing safety and charging time. o \u201cWe have almost 15 patents in solid-state batteries, it\u2019s one of the three advanced technologies that we\u2019re working on\u201d, said COO Shane Smith. 15 might not look like a lot compared to QuantumScape, which holds over 200 patents and patent applications related to solid-state battery technology, but they operate in different markets, MVST in commercial vehicle batteries and QS more in the passenger EV batteries. Also, it\u2019s important to mention that they are not really competitors at the moment, Microvast generated about $ 107 million in sales in 2020 and is expecting to generate more than $2 billion in sales in 2025 compared to QuantumScape, which will not generate meaningful revenues until 2026, according to the website \u201cbarrons.com. Partnership/Customers \\- They have solid partnerships, including FPT (the global powertrain brand of CNH Industrial Group), Oshkosh (leading global innovator of mission-critical vehicles and essential equipment), Porsche, SAIC, and many more. Oshkosh also made a $25MM strategic investment in the PIPE, and signed joint development agreement highlighting future battery collaboration and integration. It is worth mentioning that Oshkosh received the USPS contract to replace its mail delivery trucks (the initial contract is. worth $482 million). Also, it is an open contract, meaning USPS will be able to order more vehicles throughout the 10-year contract (they will order between 50,000 and 165,000 vehicles but the short answer is that MVST is 10 times better... If we do a quick head-to-head comparison, we can see Microvast seems to have a clearer path to achieve its Revenue goals. \\\\\\ is headquartered in Los Angeles with a factory of 113K sq.ft compared to Microvast with its biggest factory in China (1.72MM sq.ft.), another one in Germany (170K sq.ft.), and one in the United States in 2022 (577K sq.ft.). In contrast, \\\\\\ has more than 200 employees and Microvast is expected to hire around 300 employees only for their new factory in Tennessee and they also have more than 500 employees working in the R&D division as mentioned before. It looks like Microvast is better positioned to profit from global electrification with their factories established in three different parts of the world. The picture below shows both their year-over-year revenues growth, which could be a bit misleading as they are not in the same business stage and operate in different continents for now. China and Europe lead the United States in electric commercial vehicles on the road, which could explain the difference. \u200b But the point I want to make here is that they rely on different things, \\\\\\ miss on revenues is due to the short-term limited number of battery cell providers, producing safe, high-performance cells suitable for the commercial electric vehicle market. \u201cWe know, we, and the whole industry, need more cells\u201d, said the CEO of \\\\\\ in their latest earnings call. Whereas Microvast produces their own cells, relying more on the primary resources. See the picture below for Microvast 2021 projected Revenues as well as \\\\\\ forecasted and revised revenues. \u200b On the other hand, it is true that Microvast did not have earnings call yet to discuss their 2021 outlook but I believe they are in line to achieve their projected revenues. They had \\~ $107 MM in revenues in 2020 and if they keep the same YoY growth rate of 115% (Q1 2020 \u00e0 Q1 2021), they will get to $230 MM by the end of the year. The key differentiator here is that Microvast manufactures their own cells, which ensures high quality, faster product development, greater customization to client needs, and tighter cost control as well as higher margins. The fact that Microvast has its own in-house manufacturing capacity is a clear competitive advantage to my eyes (see picture below, found on Microvast website). \u200b Both of these companies are currently highly valued based on their potential and future expected revenues. At their current market cap, \\\\\\ is selling at an estimated 2021 P/S ratio between 23 and 51 and MVST with an estimated 2021 P/S ratio of about 12. Once again, these two companies are not at the same business stage and I believe they will both succeed and grow at an impressive pace, however, MVST\u2019s growth perspective and business model seem less risky and more predictable. I have a conservative 2023 Price target on MVST of $25 (that was for Seeking Alpha, let's be real here $25 is legit fair value for Microvast, it should trade at a premium for all its potential not a discount), which is more than a 200% increase from its current price of about 8$ and $25 also happens to be their 52 week-high. My price target is based on discounted 2023 revenues and a P/S ratio of 12 (85% of forecasted 2023 revenues (85%\\751MM) \\ 12 = \\~$7,5 billion market cap). Considering their direct competitor is currently more expensive (P/S between 23-51) and other companies operating in a similar sector are trading at high valuations: Tesla (\\~20 P/S), Pro terra (\\~11 P/S), QuantumScape (Market cap of 9.5B without revenues yet), and Nikola (Market cap of \\~4B without revenues yet), Microvast can be considered as fairly cheap and this price target of $25 as conservative. It could easily go to $40 is what I meant. TAM is estimated to be $30Bn + in 2025 \u00b7 Battery providers are expected to play a pivotal role in the EV value chain: \\~ 30-40% of EV value resides in the battery. \u00b7 The rotation from gas-powered commercial vehicles to electric-powered commercial vehicles might happen quicker than the rotation from gas passenger cars to electric passenger cars because of government funding. Also, with the lithium shortage, the world will have to mine more lithium but it would not make sense to use powered-gas trucks to mine to then build electric batteries for a greener future, I believe the U.S government as well as the other governments, will make sure we use clean energy to mine lithium or any other natural resources, which would benefit Microvast. \u00b7 The demand is bigger than the supply at the moment with battery cell production in the U.S. just below 40 GWh in 2020, while battery demand exceeded 42 GWh. For context, achieving President Biden\u2019s goal of a 100% electric fleet of U.S. government vehicles will require 69 GWh of battery cells. I believe Microvast is well-positioned to become a giant in the industry with their new factories; they planned ahead, which could give them a competitive advantage over their competitors. \u00b7 EV Battery market is believed to be at a key inflection point (EV is 1.5% of 2020 sales \u2013 8.5% by. 2025), which equals to an expected CAGR of 55% (based on sales in key markets: U.S, Europe, China, Japan & South Korea). Source: Microvast investors presentation. o China\u2019s 14th Five-Year Plan called for electric vehicles to constitute 20 percent of overall new car sales in China by 2021 from just 5% now (spending up to $1.5 trillion). o Joe Biden won the U.S presidential election with a sweeping infrastructure program (up to $2 trillion). o Microvast is well diversified in these three growing markets with its biggest factory in China (1.72MM sq.ft.), one in Germany (170K sq.ft.), and another one in production in the United States (577K sq.ft., expected to start production in 2022). \\- According to Shelby Tucker, RBC Capital Markets, LLC Utilities Analyst, the global market for batteries has the potential to grow 100 times by 2050. Also, great find by u/Little\\Objective\\683/ asked Microvast in 2019 to build a Li-ion battery facility in the United States to fulfill Microvast's biggest order to date, which will make Microvast the largest American Li-ion Manufacturer. \u200b Global market presence After primarily being focused on the PRC and Asia-Pacific regions, they are expanding their presence and product promotion to Europe and the United States to capitalize on the rapidly growing electrification markets. In 2021, they will be launching a marketing campaign to introduce Microvast to more potential customers in regions outside the Asia Pacific region and adding more headcounts to support business development (source: Sec.gov; DEF14 form, \u201cSubject to certain exceptions, the Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement further provides (1) Wu will be subject to a lock-up of one year with respect to 25% of his shares and a lock-up of two years for the remaining 75% of his shares, provided that, with respect to the 25% of his shares subject to the one-year lock-up, he can sell those shares if the shares trade at $15.00 or above for 20 days in any 30-day period and (2) the Microvast equity holders other than Wu are subject to a six-month lock-up. The Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement further provides that the shares owned by the Sponsor Group will be subject to a lock-up. Specifically, with respect to 75% of the shares owned by the Sponsor Group, (a) 2/3rds of such shares are subject to a one-year lock-up unless the shares trade at $12.50 or above for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period and (b) the remaining 1/3rd of such shares are subject to a one-year lock-up. With respect to the remaining 25% of the shares owned by the Sponsor Group, (a) 50% of such shares are locked-up until the later of the one-year anniversary of the Closing and the date on which the shares trade at $12.00 or above for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period, (b) the remaining 50% of such shares are locked-up until the later of the one-year anniversary of the Closing and the date on which the shares trade at $15.00 or above for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period and (c) all of such shares are subject to forfeiture if such trading targets are not met by the fifth anniversary of the Closing.\u201d. In other words, insiders are not \u201cdumping shares on us\u201d at a price of about $8 (now $10) because of their lock-up agreement. Should you fear Microvast because it is a Chinese company? Perma bulls will tell you it is not a Chinese company as it is headquartered and founded in Houston, Texas. In reality, it really is a Chinese battery maker coming public through an American SPAC, according to Dana Blankenhorn. If you were on vacation the past couple of weeks, here\u2019s what happened with the Chinese stocks: \\- A crackdown on education has spread to Chinese tech stocks and the whole Chinese market (MSCI China index delivered negative returns of -14% in July). \\- Investors fear the unpredictability of the Chinese government, which could explain the 40% drop in MVST share price in a month. So, the question is, should you be greedy when others are fearful as Warren Buffet said? Or should you panic sell after a 40% drop in a month? Here\u2019s what UBS Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefel had to say on China: \u201cFor the tech sector, Beijing remains focused on its long-term goal of technological self-sufficiency and leadership on the global stage. We believe the regulatory risk will continue in the socially sensitive sectors of property. And healthcare, we don\u2019t expect the government will push these sectors to non-profit either\u201d. Another important part that Mark Haefel discussed is directly related to Microvast: \u201cOffshore equities are pricing in a higher risk premium. This is likely to linger in the near term. However, we think Future returns will be largely driven by earnings growth (mainly from cyclical and value sectors) this year. We recommend investors cherry-pick stocks across sectors that are supported by earnings growth but have limited regulatory risk exposure. Our preferred sectors include consumer durables and services, energy, and Greentech.\u201d In the short term, who knows where the stock price can go, however, if Microvast delivers on their promises, we will most likely see abnormal returns. I understand the risk of companies operating in China, but what I particularly like about Microvast is that they are diversifying away from China with their factory in Germany and one incoming in the United States, they will be on three different continents, which is worth something to my eyes. Let\u2019s summarize what has been said before with a SWOT Analysis SWOT AnalysisStrengths: \u00d8 Unlike competitors who redesign existing batteries to fit them in EVs, Microvast has designed its batteries from the ground up specifically to address the problems facing EV batteries. Every step of the manufacturing process is controlled by Microvast, leading to higher quality and lower-cost products. \u00d8 Researchers from Microvast have developed a novel high-power battery technology that has a higher energy density, longer life, and safer operation than any other state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery on the market. The system is built from four breakthrough technologies and could potentially be used in plug-in hybrid electric vehicle and fully electric vehicle markets. Because of its many benefits, the technology has the potential to also enhance the performance of lithium-ion batteries used in cell phones and other smaller-scale applications, as well as in electric grid applications. \u00d8 $ 1.5B total contracted revenue in Pipeline through 2027, which will help Microvast to grow revenue at an expected CAGR of 87% from 2020-2025E Weaknesses: \u00d8 Being a \u201cChinese company\u201d, U.S investors might not like it as much as a U.S company. \u00d8 Portfolio Managers being scared of investing in SPACs or even the \u201cdeSPACs phase \u201cafter the SPACs controversy in the beginning of 2021. Opportunities: \u00d8 There is three substantial untapped markets that Microvast plans on expanding their products offering to; Passenger Vehicles (PV), Energy Storage Solutions (ESS), and Battery Components (Consumer Electronics), which could expand their TAM by $45B. \u00d8 2021: Begin Battery Production in the area of Berlin, Germany \u00d8 2022: Begin Battery Production in Clarksville, TN Threats: \u00d8 Susceptible to disruption, many companies are trying to improve EV batteries and might not need Microvast in the foreseeable future. \u00d8 The Prices of Lithium-ion batteries have been plummeting over the past decade, and that trend is expected to continue in the coming years, which could impact Microvast\u2019s profit margin. \u00d8 Other companies are working hard on lowering EV battery costs, one or more of them could make a battery substantially cheaper than Microvast. To conclude, I believe the growth opportunity in the commercial EV battery sector is impressive as well as somewhat predictable as it makes sense for companies to go electric economically, financially, and environmentally. Microvast is well-positioned to capture a great portion of the total addressable market of $30 Bn and has the opportunity to dramatically increase their TAM if they expand their business to consumer electronics, passenger EV batteries, and energy storage solutions market. The fact that Microvast went public through a SPAC merger less than a week ago gives retail investors an edge to generate alpha as analysts have not started to cover the company yet. Microvast also fits the criteria of sustainable investing, a trend that is not about to die anytime soon. Overall, Microvast has everything it needs to become a successful company; it now just needs to deliver on its promises. So, the real question is: does the upside outweigh the downside? You tell me. \\\\Disclaimer I own shares and warrants of MVST.

The Infrastructure Bill- Includes $65 billion for improving the nation\u2019s broadband infrastructure. Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg has promised 100 million Americans will have access to speeds up to 1 Gigabit per second by March 2022, and Verizon already offers 5G Home that runs on millimeter wave technology to parts of 47 U.S. cities. When it comes to 5G, Verizon beats its competitors in games/voice/video. \u200b Speaking of 5G- Bidding in the next US Auction (Auction 110) for mid-band spectrum in the 3.45GHz band starts October 5. \u201cThis is a critical step toward delivering on the promise of 5G,\u201d said FCC Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel in a statement. \u201cThis auction will bring us closer to 5G service that is fast, secure, resilient, and most importantly, available across the country.\u201d Mid-band spectrum is largely viewed as key for 5G services \u2013 offering more capacity for speeds than lower bands, but better propagation for distance and coverage than high-band millimeter wave. This auction has a big fat red Verizon check mark written all over it. Tracfone Merger- Last September, Verizon announced its plan to purchase Tracfone in a deal valued at more than $6 billion. The acquisition would give Verizon over 20 million new subscribers and a tighter grasp on the low-income wireless and value phone market. Verizon plans to close the deal before the end of the year, which was reiterated by Vestberg on the Q2 earnings call. The CWA, Public Knowledge, and the Benton Institute for Broadband and Society had initially criticized Verizon\u2019s proposed purchase of Tracfone, but the groups announced last Thursday that they would be withdrawing their opposition in response to new concessions. This is a big win for Verizon in the FCC\u2019s review of the acquisition. Don\u2019t forget Verizon is the official wireless carrier of the NFL.

{"text": "JPow\u2019s time at the Fed is coming to an end with his term expiring in February 2022. Biden will not renominate him as Chair and instead will nominate Lael Brainard. Lael Brainard is a current Fed Governor and was nominated as a Governor in 2012 along with JPow. Since many of you enjoyed my post on China, I thought I may share my thoughts on the Fed. 1. Spending is politically popular. Politicians are only focused on the next election, whether it be a House or Senate seat, or even the Presidency. The level of deficit spending the US currently engages in would not be possible unless the Fed agrees to purchase the issuance by Treasury. While the Fed may call this QE, it is not. This is monetizing deficits (or money printing) because the Fed is buying new Treasury issuance from a broker dealer immediately after it buy them from Treasury auctions (for those who don\u2019t know broker deals are required to bid on Treasury auctions). Janet Yellen wants JPow to buy as much Treasury bonds as possible as the market does not want this negative yielding asset (it is negative yielding because of high inflation currently). This is seen through the 120Bn in monthly purchases (80Bn treasury bonds, 40Bn MBS). 2. Biden has said publicly he wishes to elevate women or people of color. JPow is neither of those. He is a 68 year old white dude with years of Wall Street experience as MP at the Carlyle Group. The Carlyle Group is a private equity firm founded by David Rubenstein in the mid 1980s. 3. JPow is trying to simp for the job. I have watched JPow for many years and have noticed recently he has changed his tune. He now seems to care about regulating Wall Street, climate change, and income inequality. These views were absent during the Trump administration. JPow has also expressed an interest in running the economy hot (with high inflation) to ensure a full job recovery. This directly contradicts his actions in 2018 where he was only interested in raising interest rates at the first sign of inflation. 4. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, shares many of the same views as Progressives. She is a woman and a Democrat, where JPow is a Republican. Most importantly, she is publicly calling for the Fed to adopt a digital Dollar, which is in direct conflict with her colleagues. Brainard joined the Fed in 2012 (the same time as JPow) and has a good relationship with Janet Yellen. Under Brainard\u2019s leadership the Fed would be less likely to taper, if at all. This would allow the Fed to continue to monetize deficits which would allow for more politically popular spending. I have no positions in the market other than a SPAC I am going to redeem. The rest of my assets are in cash. JPow will be told whether he has the job in September, although I am still staying on the sidelines after being burned in Chinese stocks.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-08-08 17:37:54", "id": "p0fsmf"}
{"text": "Disclaimer: All Credit to Jeff Booth, you might look like a Velociraptor but you\u2019re the most brilliant financial mind I\u2019ve ever come across. Time to strap on the propeller hat and stab a Capri Sun. We\u2019re about to get retarded. You gotta love the parade of dogshit economists on CNBC that scream about the market being a house of cards. No shit buddy, I drop my pants to my ankles every time I piss and I knew that. The truth is there are really only two forces that are deciding the fate of your net worth. Force 1 The first is the deflationary pressure of exponential technology. We\u2019re living in a world where huge industries are being rendered obsolete by rapid digitization, automation, artificial intelligence and the ability to mass produce certain goods quickly. Regardless of the company, the goal has always been to deliver more of a good/service with less resources. They have to operate like that to survive because we, as customers, are always voting. We are hardwired to vote with our money to get more for less price. The issue is that, in the process of streamlining their production, the amount of human labor needed becomes less and less. The products become cheaper and your utility as a laborer decreases since WALL-E can take your place. There\u2019s a reason that wages haven\u2019t increased for decades. You\u2019re not just fighting for a job against your neighbor\u2019s wife that joined the labor force in the 70\u2019s, or a guy in India willing to do your job remotely. You\u2019re now competing for a job against an artificial intelligence protocol who wasn\u2019t programmed to give a shit about you or the box you sleep in. The supply of laborers is high and the demand for unskilled or even moderately skilled labor only decreases over time. So technology is deflationary. Wages and easily reproducible goods must decrease in worth. Therefore, technology creates an ever expanding hole in the portion of Gross Domestic Product that human labor contributes to. Force 2 The second force are Central Banks themselves. Their one and only objective is to fill this hole in GDP. JPOW himself wakes up in a cold sweat every night thinking about the financial Armageddon that would happen if he ever stopped quantitative easing or bumped up rates. Every developed nation is more or less in the same boat. The goal is to devalue your fiat through inflation to counter the immense deflationary force of exponential tech innovation. If you let off the gas for even a moment, a deflationary hell will ensue that will dwarf the Housing Crisis. The debt bubble is astronomical and everyone knows that these debts can never be paid. But since most of the debt is denominated in US Dollars, the US Federal Reserve has a moral obligation to let it run so damn hot that JPOW wears oven mitts to work. This devaluation of the dollar through inflation is really just a hidden tax that attempts to spread the burden equally. But it doesn\u2019t. The devaluation of the denominator (dollar) will only drive up the prices of scarce assets, further concentrating the wealth into the hands of asset holders alone. The poor are left working for pitiful wages that they stuff into a 0.5% savings account while the buying power of their cash will be almost cut in half every 3 years. How They Lie The Fed has been publishing fake inflation numbers since the Housing Crisis by using \u201cThe Substitution Method\u201d to calculate the Consumer Price Index. In other words, they compare last year\u2019s steak price to this year\u2019s tofu price instead of comparing it to the steak price you\u2019d see at the grocery store today. Then they can put on their best poker face and call a press conference to say, \u201cWell shit, inflation must be stupid low since these two goods could be considered comparable.\u201d In other words, the current global financial standard is the deck of the Titanic and even the glue eaters on CNBC can hear that sad string quartet playing their last songs. How to Save Yourself The first thing to remember is that Central Banks have no choice. They are fighting a war to keep 401k\u2019s from imploding and the only weapons they have at their disposal will always funnel wealth to those that already have scarce assets. Unless you have those assets already, you\u2019re playing a losing game. But there are ways to position yourself to save the net worth of yourself and your family. Option 1: Invest in Exponential Technology. If you can\u2019t beat them, join them. Let the AI, the robots and automation be on your side. Do your homework and invest in tickers that have exponential technology working to accumulate wealth for them. If tech\u2019s job has always been to deliver more for less, than all long term investing is tech investing (unless you subscribe to Buffet\u2019s dusty old cigar butt approach). A good place to start would be by reading the balance sheets of the tickers in Cathie Wood\u2019s portfolio. Option 2: Abandon the Current Financial System and Adopt the New One Say what you want about the forbidden B-word, but it is secure and scarce. It is a life raft. There\u2019s a reason that the whole ecosystem's number of users is growing by 112% year over year, outpacing the adoption of the internet by almost double. B-word seeks to be a store of value, a perfect digital gold. There will never be confusion about who owns what (like there was during the Housing Crisis). Other well-known protocols are currently duking it out to become the world\u2019s next financial derivative layer, which would aim to disrupt the almost 1 quadrillion derivate layer we currently have. Some of these are even becoming deflationary and will offer you yield in exchange for contributing to the security of the network. They are not without their risks though so do your homework. Option 3: Take Advantage of Cheap Credit and Accumulate Scarce Assets or at least Difficult-to-Reproduce Assets To my knowledge, no one has figured out how to effectively mass produce a decent single family home. Real estate is a great example of those scarce assets that must be pumped. There\u2019s a reason why Blackrock has been accumulating real estate through REITs. They see the writing on the wall and they don\u2019t really give a shit that you probably can\u2019t outbid them or afford the future rent. They are just a rational actor thinking about how they can conserve capital. Whether it\u2019s on a sovereign level, company level or individual level, we are all playing the same game and trying to accumulate scarcity. Good luck, my brothers TLDR: Technology is an unstoppable deflationary force. JPOW\u2019s only weapon is to devalue fiat to prevent the debt Armageddon. Owners of scarce assets become wealthier and you get robbed of buying power. Save yourself and your family by accumulating scarce assets, moving to the future\u2019s financial standard or by being on the robots\u2019 good side.", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-08-04 17:06:13", "id": "oxtezo"}
{"text": "Listen up, retards. I've seen too much gain porn on this sub recently. I joined here to lose money on FDs, and if any of you think \"but isn't that risky?\" I suggest you hand me your paper certificates of the shares so I can use them to light a cigar. Now that only those of us remain which snort enough crayon dust to paint our insides like an LSD trip, let's talk business. What follows is my main way to lose money, fast. On \u03b8 gang I'll say it's just a small part of my real account at the real broker for real grown ups, but they don't know about the RH depot. This is gonna be 0DTE $SPY FDs. So Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Gives you Tuesday, Thursday, or the weekend to make it back with handies at the dumpster. ( 1. Perform TA and/or divination. I usually get bored after drawing half the stegosaurs into the pattern so TA isn't for me and after the last divination attempt I'm not allowed within a hundred yards of a petting zoo \u2013 store bought liver may also work if you live near a butcher. If you wish to consult the stock market gods just look at ( for a few minutes and check for any patterns. My go-to is that they usually all contain words. 2. Grab a set of dice. It is very important to have several. Especially if you saw bad omens in the first step. You don't want to use only one die because if it's cursed that ruins everything. If any of your rolls today turn out to be bad, ( As for what kind of dice, see below. It's mostly personal risk tolerance. 3. Did you wake uo feeling like shit or not? If your butt is still sore from last night, that's bearish. If your BF let you top, bullish. Inverse yourself. 4. Prepare your strategy list. Just go to ( if you don't know any. Take the ones with cool names and write them down. I recommend the double diagonal because it looks like ( Once you have your list, just number them. I recommend numbering them in order but that's optional. 5. Select a strategy. Depending on how long your list is you may want to use a die, but dartboards and roulette wheels are proven to work just as well. 6. Now that you've got a strategy it's time to determine your strike prices. Roll a die to see how far in/out the money you are going to be. Remember to use point number three for guidance. If it's a multi-leg strategy like a debit spread, use this for the closer strike. If it's multiple spreads like a condor, make it symmetric. Or don't. 7. If your strategy is a spread, use another die to roll spread width. Remember, smaller spreads lose faster. So don't use a D20 unless you're a certified pussy. 8. Roll another die for leverage. If you don't have margin left I recommend a home equity loan, max out your credit card if grandma hasn't croaked yet and you rent. Payday loan sharks are a great choice as well. The bigger the die you use here, the better. 9. Now we have our investment set up. Queue it up on Robinhood so it gets filled the instant market opens. If your broker doesn't allow market orders, just ask for no credit or enter a bigger debit than spread width. The faster you get filled the more time your money can make more money for you. 10. Expect Robin Hood risk management to liquidate your account an hour or two before market close. If you were way in the green and RH RM shoves a huge red dildo up your ass by being worse than national best offer, get used to it. If they don't close your position you may be really fucked. If any of you do this for a week straight and don't go bankrupt I'll go to Walmart and buy you tendies from a brand of your choice.

{"text": "Quick introduction I\u2019m a degenerate and all that but I came about this opportunity from my passion as a fan of aerospace. I am going to college for aerospace and have hours and hours and hours of obsession and background knowledge from being a fan of the industry since childhood. Astra just signed another new contract, this time with a private small sat company Spire to launch in 2022. This is in addition to the Space Force contract and broader Department of Defense contract recently secured earlier this week. Both contracts are multiple launches over the next decade. I can\u2019t exaggerate how important and massive US governmental contracts are to a young rocket company. While some space launch providers take years and dozens of attempts to prove reliability of their vehicles, the government contracting Astra as one of three companies chosen for Space Forces Orbital Services Program (OSP 4) legitimizes the company and its technology globally. Astra is meant to be a scalable company that sells rockets in the normal small satellite market but also to other governmental space agencies around the world. Of 90 countries with space agencies only less then 30 can actually reliably reach space. However, Astra\u2019s focus on scalable production and rockets that fit entirely within a standard sized shipping container means that these rockets can safely and easily be shipped anywhere in the world to launch, and can do so at a cost basis many multiples lower then whatnot would cost to fully design and produce a rocket yourself. SHORT TERM PRICE POTENTIAL: Astra will be publishing their earnings today for the first time after hours. I\u2019ll be honest I don\u2019t care and don\u2019t know what to expect but I do think that it is possible that we see some massive price action given the string of new contracts and commitments that have come out just this week. It will also lend clarity to future expectations and ambitions that can be a major producer of hype. Astra will also be attempting to enter orbit for the first time very soon on August 27th. They have been to space but orbit is higher then that and they fell just slightly short when they planned to only just hit orbit on their last launch. This will be their first orbital flight and their first ever commercial flight, not to mention their first attempt as a public company. They have many great former NASA engineers who have put in the work and I have no doubt they will succeed. The government is marred in bureaucracy and risk isn\u2019t very common, the DOD and Space Force would not sign contracts if the company didn\u2019t have their shit together. This is a competitive market, those wins mean a LOT. I have no idea how it\u2019s so undervalued, it shouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s worth 2.78 Billion but space TOURISM companies like Virgin Galactic is worth like 10 B. The market for scalable reliable well engineered and mass producible rockets is a proven market, as compared to space tourism which has had two successful spaceflights, both for show, ever (Bezos and Branson). It could easily 3X and still be undervalued, with no real catalysts because it\u2019s simply underpriced. I also posted DD about Rocket Lab but they are doing a SPAC thing so I won\u2019t talk about that here. (I love that stock). Y\u2019all the pieces are their, Astra is undervalued because from a boomer POV, it\u2019s some crazy Rocket people who just recently went public via SPAC, but in reality it\u2019s an absurdly undervalued play that seems risky on the surface but is increasingly legitimate. Look at the coverage it gets from the space nerd community, it\u2019s a lot of high praise and talk about what they do, which is fairly unique as there are a ton of space launch providers who get no coverage as they aren\u2019t interesting or they aren\u2019t affecting the realm of space enough to warrant a mention. This is not the case with Astra. I have a bunch of options expiring Sept 17th as well as 109 shares, between being undervalued, the upcoming orbital launch, and attention being brought to the industry by Rocket Lab going public into the 20th, there\u2019s likely to be some significant upside in the short term. Good DD sources for in depth information: NASA Spaceflight interviews: -ASTR Rocket Factory Tours: -ASTR Scott Manley coverage of this and many companies is also high quality informed DD TL:DR; Astra might have a massive 2-5x move that could be a well justified and conservative estimate for the near term. Many crayons were eaten and I am in 100% on this company and the industry. It was a matter of time but with the good news from Astra these rockets are going to see major price action in the very near future, as well as being a great long term pick", "label": 0, "source": "reddit_wsb", "timestamp": "2021-08-12 19:58:36", "id": "p33zgi"}

{"text": "Hello fellow earth-tards. I\u2019m sure atleast 40 of you boiling hot egg bags have heard recently that \u201cclimate change\u201d is heavily affecting global markets and other stupid shit (venezuela). let\u2019s face it, allegedly it\u2019s getting fucking hot outside. i don\u2019t need some stupid science bitch to tell me that. And this my fellow geniuses, is where the party starts. PART 1: THE WHEAT SHORTAGE i can already hear you fucking retards reciting it outloud, wheat shortage? yeah, you fuckhead. not only has the pandemic severely effected global farming efforts but this stupid hot rock you call the sun is literally vaporizing our crops. there is approximately 42% less wheat in global circulation since 2019. 42%!? yeah, the exact hit your portfolio took on those Venezulaean underground runescape gold farming market futures. You\u2019re retarded if you think this isn\u2019t an issue. Side note: Puts on olive garden, only good shit they have is the breadsticks. I shouldn\u2019t have to elaborate on how literal radiation killing one of the largest producers of food in the world is a bad fucking thing. Less wheat = Less food = Less people = less money that jpow has to print for stimulus checks. PART 2: WATER CRISIS 2: ELECTRIC BOOGALOO Wait, less water? I might be retarded but i know i\u2019m atleast 60% water. let me put this in simple terms for you palantards: no wawa mean less crops no crops mean no food, no food or wawa mean less people AND LESS PEOPLE MEANS LESS SURVEILANCE YOUR STOCK IS DOGSHIT AND SURE TO FAIL. $5 put PLTR LEAPS Less water is generally a bad thing, unless ofcourse youre one of the fat degenerates who are quite literally living solely off mountain dew and frozen dino nuggets. It\u2019s getting hard to believe that we are LITERALLY losing a 1v1 to a fucking gas giant. imagine being that retarded. but i have imagined it, and i understand now that the best thing to do is run your shower at all hours of the day. THATS RIGHT BOYS, WERE STOCKING UP ON WATER FOR THE NEXT DROUGHT. I have stored 500 gallons of shower water in my basement that i plan on flipping for a profit. Last month my water bill was $5,326 and i plan on atleast getting a ten bagger out of this. SOURCE: Get the picture yet? we\u2019re gonna be fucking rich. Currently i\u2019m running every sink in my home and basically just creating as much of a carbon footprint as possible. i leave the stove on at all hours of the day, currently my car is running nonstop AC blasting. I have built an interconnected series of tunnels that funnel gasoline directly from a crude oil pipeline that i outsourced from the government of south carolina. Every sunday i go down to the beach and break coral reefs for multiple hours.. i am doing my part to accelerate the gains on my positions. now if we all work together we can speed up this climate crisis and come into some serious fucking gains.
